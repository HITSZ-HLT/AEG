10279,"more and more jobs and tasks are done by machines Nowadys,more and more jobs and taks are done by machines which invlove hard physical work.Do these effects of this trend outweigh the negative effects?","There was a conspicuous tendency that high-technology machines implemented in a variety of industries in recent years. Some people hold a passion opinion about this, but I believe that enables people to live in a more convenient life. Ċ Owing to the fact that lots of physical hard works were undertaken by the machinery,promoting people a bigger space in innovation and creativity. As for individuals, people are free up in the repetitive and body-harm physical works, which saves them much time and energy. From the community side, their management can become more efficient and convenient through the labor-saving machinery,another case in point is that these machines save their labors costs a lot. In the development of industry, after the machine finishing the basic work, people are able to devote in intelligent area,such as projects produced,engineering design or liberties writing and so on. Ċ As a proverb goes, there is no garden without weeds. Seen from the negative aspect, some potential problems we cannot deny. Relying on the high-technology for a long time, people may cause a sense of dependence. Besides, with the increasing of losing the jobs which replaced by machines, the employment will be more competitive. However these results are also unavoidable in the process of society developing, which forces people to acquire advanced knowledge and skills to meet the requirements constantly. In short, these competition that results in machines undertaking more tasks can make people to work hard to keep a dominant position. Ċ In conclusion, the proliferation of the machines is a two-edged sword. But I believe the employment competition also brings some positive influence to some extent."
10280,"Nowadays, people travel to other countries for a holidays. Ċ Why people do so? Ċ is this a positive or a negative development for the countries they travel to?","Tourism gains its popularity all around the world, except for paying abroad visit. The reason for this trend is still a difficult question to discuss while some people believe that this development brings lots of negative effect on the countries having a large number of visitors. However, this essay will show some clear explanations and a huge benefit for the nations with tourism evolvement, with an appropriate conclusion. Ċ Concerning that humans choose a distinctive destination for their break-time and going abroad is always the best choice. Foremost and first, travelling to other countries brings visitors a peculiar feeling and sense of exploration. For example, Australia is famous for its modern infrastructure with fabulous forests that appeals to tourists from several nations to relax after a hard-working time. Moreover, researchers and students have opportunities to gain interesting knowledge about other cultures and traditions. It is quite useful for them to acquire great information to supply for their project or future career. Ċ Travelling abroad development brings a wide range of significant advantages to this country's economy and social reputation. Firstly, tourism industries supply an extensive profit to this nation's financial system. A recent survey reveals that approximately 50% of interests came from visitors around the world in 2020 in Korea. Additionally, this gives good chances for each authority to advertise their custom widespread through travellers without any campaigns. An illustration of this is that the Vietnamese know general information about Japan which is well-known as the peach blossom place or Italia's delicious plates. Ċ To summarize, although visitors might damage the environment in which they choose to go. The motoring development, meanwhile, the merits outweigh all the small demerits if governments publish strict regulations for travellers. In the near future, I have a tendency to believe that the progress of tourism would play a vital role in each countries' economy."
10281,"In today's very competitive world, a worker has to possess multiple skills to succeed. Among the skills that a worker should possess, which skill do you think is more important, social skills or good qualifications? Explain the reason and provide specific examples to support your answer.","An employee needs to be multi-talented to compete in the job market nowadays. In my opinion, academic degrees ought to be preferred over personal qualities while recruiting the employee for a certain profession. Ċ The academic qualifications are considered to be a major determinant by employers while recruiting a staff member. In other words, the modern education system has led universities to update their syllabi and teach students the latest and advanced knowledge. Moreover, the addition of soft skills and social aspects like team building and developing better communication skills in the degree programmes have largely obviated the need for pre-hand work experience and learning management skills. This is because many entrepreneurs are now focussing on the academic degrees of the applicants, that has, for instance, resulted in the toughest competition amongst students to enter the universities. Ċ Another important factor due to which the formal qualifications get precedence over an individual's trait is because they help in broadening the horizon of a person. For example, a less educated person may perform a task more smoothly than a newly appointed highly qualified individual, but often the former is unable to think out of the box due to his tunnel vision. This is seldom for a literate staff member who can always come up with new ideas with his vast background knowledge, which are often rewarding for the companies. Furthermore, it is difficult for a person to improve upon his education level while staying in a career, however, it is much easier to learn social skills while at work. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that academic qualifications are vital in securing a good employment position because they not only provide the basic background knowledge that is mandatory to perform a certain job, but also help in broadening the vision of an individual."
10282,Some people fail on their school but achieve success in their adult life. Why do you think this will happen? What causes/reasons may lead to a person's successful life?,"It is noticeable that although many individuals who had poor performance academically in their school time,they become very successful in terms of their career or other part of their life. This is due to the fact that information and skills acquired from our education systems are not enough for a promising life in the modern society. Ċ It is undeniable that even a well-designed education model is just focused on giving a majority of young people to acquire some basic knowledge and skills for earning a living in their adult life. These school courses and trainings are just a foundation and beginning of one's life, people need to work hard and use their resources, such as family background and talent to achieve a variety of goals throughout their life. Ċ There are different kinds of reasons that may result different kinds of success. First, having a clear target and working for it diligently are always essential. A person need to set up a clear plan and achievable goal when they trying to obtain an achievement. People's talent and personality is another importance on their way to success. We can notice that many individuals doing similar things with different results in terms of success and failure, not because of making more or less effort but resulting from these two facts mentioned above. There are also a number of other elements, which include family background, chances and even technological development that affects one's life. Ċ To conclude, in my perspective, better performances at school do not necessarily lead to succeeds in our life and vice versa. Because there are countless causes that lead to a successful life. But I insist that working hard for a reasonable goal is always the road for a success."
10283,"Good facilities can be found in cities but not in the countryside. Therefore, new doctors and teachers should be sent to the countryside. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The issue of whether allocating well-trained facilities such as doctors or teachers to rural areas is a controversial one in society nowadays. The transfer is welcomed, albeit with reservations, despite the need to transfer doctors and teachers voluntarily. Ċ The transfer of the good facilities to rural areas is to improve the detrimental conditions of lacking of well qualified workforces. As the result of being understaffed, the countryside suffers the negative chronic effects on the well-being of rural people. Distributing doctors and teachers to those sites helps the residents there enhance their living standard and life prospect. An illustration of this is that if the rural people are well educated, they have the ability to gain more opportunities to change their life. That also assists government in dealing with the problem of improving rural people's life. Ċ It is obviously recognized that the doctors or teachers, who graduate freshly with a degree only, have potential to gain experience in the rural areas. In the city, the opportunity to apply successfully to a job is relatively scarce because of the fact that there are numerous people are in the race for a single position. Ideally, the new doctors and teachers take advantage of chance to serve people in rural areas to gain experience and then, when they return to city, they have more potential to find a job. Ċ Despite these benefits, the place of working should be chose voluntarily by the doctors and teachers. It is not ethical to stop individuals' desire to have more satisfying quality of life. When moving to rural areas, there are increasing problems such as housing, transport, salary. As the result of this, the employees who volunteer to work in rural areas deserve to have a better pay as well as the recognition of their contribution to society"
10284,People are consuming more and more sugar-based drinks. Ċ Why? 	 Ċ What can be done to reduce sugary drink consumption?,"Nowadays the consumption of sugar-based drinks has been increasingly popular among people of all ages. Due to the huge variety of drinks available in many different places, people consume them on a large scale which has become damage to people`s health. This essay will discuss why people are consuming more and more sugar-based beverages and what could be done to reduce the consumption. Ċ Firstly, sugar drinks are present everywhere, because of this the access to them is even easier and frequently. The reasons for this current issue could be explained not only for the low prices but also for the celebrity endorsement. Although health organizations try to keep the population loop with negative sides of sugar overdose, social media and large companies make the opposite, in other words, they promote consumption with a low price and misleading information about the product. For example, at a supermarket, a place where the price is written in big and catching letters, but the information with calories, fat, sugar and so forth is reduced in minimum letters to be overlooked by the consumers. In sum, the use of sugar in huge quantity in some beverages has been present among the individuals which result in an uncontrolled overdose. The more social media endorses the use , the more society believes that it is ordinary and healthy. Ċ Secondly, the government should create laws more severe about uncontrolled use so that companies must be punished for unrespect them. These laws should be about the misleading information given by companies and perhaps about the prices. In other words, society should be informed about the real effects of sugar in their body before they have access to the product full of unreal and unhealthy information. For instance, an aware person about the cons of sugar certainly would be a person more prepared to make good choices about sodas and foods, which results in a society more healthy. In short, if there were laws more rigid about the disadvantages of sugar, the population should not consume sugar sodas on a large scale. Ċ In conclusion, there are many sodas at supermarkets with an excessive quantity of sugar, which leads to soaring high consumption by the population. This essay argued why individuals are consuming this kind of liquid with more frequency and what could be done to stop the overdose."
10285,Some experts say for road safety cyclists should pass a test before being allowed on public roads. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Almost every individual has a bike in The Netherlands. Because of this, sometimes it can lead to dangerous situations on the public roads. Therefore, some experts want cyclists to pass a test before being allowed on the public streets. I will outline to what extent I agree with this group. Ċ Firstly, we all learn how to cycle in The Netherlands. They have mastered cycling at a young age because their parents have taught them. Besides, at the primary school will they be subject to an unofficial travel-safety exam. Thereby, the general level of cyclists on the road is very high in, for instance, The Netherlands. This results in fewer accidents. Ċ Furthermore, we also stimulate people to go by bike. This is because we want to think more about the environment. If we introduce a test for a cyclist, the incentive to leave the car will be reduced. Nevertheless, there are also states in which it is not common that you practise how to cycle at a young age. Arising from this can be stated that it will lead to more traffic casualties. For example, in Spain is it not a regular activity to ride on a bike within the city. They often look at these people like they are tourists. In those countries will it be more dangerous on the road. Ċ In conclusion, it is unnecessary to require someone to take an exam before they are allowed to cycle in countries where the general level of cyclists is already quite high. However, in countries where is it not usual that individuals go to their destination by bike, an exam can be used to make the traffic safer."
10286,"Topic: Mobile phones and the internet are very useful. However, it is rare for old people to use them. What ways could mobile phones and the internet be useful to old people? How does the old people to be encouraged using this new technology?","There are many great inventions of the 20th-century. Among the inventions mobile phones and the internet are widely used in our life; nevertheless, old people rarely use them because they have not realized the benefits of mobile phones and the internet. Ċ Obviously, mobile phones and the internet could be useful to old people in various ways. To start with, both of them are convenient. For example, if old people carrying mobile phones encounter difficulties outdoors, they will call for help immediately instead of finding a booth. In addition, the internet can help old people to collect extensive information. There is no doubt that searching for news online is effective and time-saving. Furthermore, people using the internet can save their money. As is known to all, online shopping provides a platform for individuals to purchase cheaper products. Ċ As mobile phones and the internet are helpful, it is necessary to encourage old people using them. Firstly, to help old people get familiar with the new technology, our government can offer some elementary courses about using mobile phones and the internet. Secondly, the fees of network services can be reduced for seniors so that they will be willing to use them. Last but not least, we can propagate the ideas that using mobile phones and the internet can better our life. Once old people are aware of the advantages brought by the new technologies, they will start to use mobile phones and the internet intentionally. Ċ In conclusion, old people should not stay away from the new technologies and they should be encouraged using them."
10287,"Traditional Food Vs International Fast Food In many countries, traditional food is being replaced by international fast food. This is having a negative effect on both families and societies. To what extent do you agree or disagree? The Processed Food Deluge","In recent years, International fast food companies have spread their branches to some countries. It causes negative impacts not only in the issue of health but also in cultural identity which replaced the traditional food. I strongly agree with this opinion that International fast food will lead to negative impact both on society and family. Ċ First, junk food produced by International Companies will directly affect to the local cuisines in the particular area. It makes the sales of Small Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in that country will decrease due to loss of customers who move to modern fast food. While it hard to avoid International fast food entering into one country, traditional food cannot easily be forgotten as it has cultural values to the country. Second, in terms of healthy, according to current research, junk food contains unhealthy ingredients that cause a number of different diseases to the human. For example, a substance called MSG that mostly found in junk food caused slow thinking for those who consumed often. Other chronic diseases such as high blood pressure will impact to the most of the people. Ċ In the family scope that usually consumes fast food, will disadvantage by losing their family closeness due to the less of time spending together with family members. For example, mothers who not cooked in their homes will unlikely to have a good relationship with their kids because they invest less time to their kids or other family members. Ċ In conclusion, it seems to me that junk food obviously leads to several problems both in society and the family. All stakeholders should rethink about the strategy to solve and prevent this problem for a long-term objective."
10288,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (for example a play, concert or sport event) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.","There is an argument that people may get more pleasure by observing a live show than watching it on television. While I accept the fact that overwhelming amount of people prefer to watch a performance on the TV, I completely agree with that statement for two reasons. Ċ First of all, people on a live performance are more involved. Have you ever seen an exited face of a boy who was invited to assist a magician in a circus, for example? Actors often work with the audience, talk to people, try to conduct a link with them. Moreover, producers may organize an extra show for the audience. For instance, I saw how children were involved into a little competition before a hockey game and a child who scored more goals got a prize. Ċ Second, such a pastime is a good way to cement relationships between relatives. For example, my wife and I frequently go to the theater or concert. After a show we discuss it and share our impressions. At home we hardly spend an hour together because of children and grandparents. Besides, attending a live performance helps to develop a special bond between a father and children. For instance, I take my son with me to see an ice hockey game and during the game I discuss with him various topics such as the ice hockey rules or importance of a nice behavior in society. Ċ To sum up, I totally agree with the argument that observing a live performance is more delightful. On a live show people are more involved and it is an appropriate way to improve relationships with relatives."
10289,"when cars and cyclists use the same roads, there are often problems. why is this the case? Ċ what are the solutions?","Problems on the streets are increasing day by day because people use these for their movement from one place to another. But, mostly, issues are arising with cars and cycles using the same roads. Let us discuss why this is happening and what can be done to solve this for a better understanding. Ċ To begin with, roads are not wide enough so that, cars and cycles could run comfortably without creating any problem. In other words, cycles are slower than cars and it becomes difficult for both passengers using the same road. For example, when overtaking cyclists, car drivers have to wait for a long time to clear the other side of the road filled with cars for their safety. In addition, Car drivers must follow some regulations applied by the government while, for driving a cycle, there is no rule. There are some roads where drivers must not pass other vehicles like cycles, rickshaws and so on. If they do so they will be fined and create traffic jams. Ċ However, To solve these problems the governments have to think of building separate tracks not only for the commodity of the vehicles but also for the safety of riders. For instance, they could build small streets alongside the big roads as they are already for footpath passengers. Therefore hazardousSuggestionTherefore, hazardousTherefore hazardTherefore hazard hazardTherefore hazards on the roads will not be created by these vehicles. Ċ To conclude, Same roads used by the cars and cycles generate many problems due to the insufficient width and rules for the commuters. But, these can be combatted with the help of the street authorities."
10290,Some old people today struggle with the use of modern technologies such as smart phones and computers. What is the cause of this and what are some possible solutions?,"In the Past-faced life, technological advancement is developing rapidly and becomes an essential need of humans. However, few aged persons, including our elderly, face problems using technological gadgets like laptops and smartphones, appearing as an obstacle these days, eventually. The upcoming article will discuss the reasons and the appropriate solutions that need to apply with the help of relevant illustrations. Ċ Firstly, the primary cause behind this impediment of hardship in using technological assets that comes under consideration is probably the generation gap. In other words, the old-aged public is habitual of using older gadgets that were prevalent in their times such as landlines and other items and the advanced level assets need many knowledgeable skills to use them so, it is pretty difficult for them to change their monotony suddenly and make themselves comfortable in using that stuff. For example, a smartphone of various brands is trending these days that indulge so many functionalities including application software, which seems extremely hard for an old age person to use as he is not aware of them indeed. Thus, new technological material is updated enough to handle for an old-age public. Ċ Nevertheless, there are possible solutions to resolve these issues, including advancement awareness and change in the environment. Specifically, children need to guide their parent about using upcoming technology-based items. Similarly, the authorized personnel should help their employers attain these items by introducing new computers into the official premises. For instance, in the banking sector, all paper works need to be done with the help of virtual data storage devices used in laptops and personal computers; as a result, employers can enhance their knowledge according to the new advancement with determination. Ċ Lastly, after discussing the causes and looking forth of possible solutions, everyone has the right to learn about anything regardless of age; therefore, a family member and as well as colleagues in a business corporate ought to take responsibility to help an elderly and business persons in getting knowledgeable matter about uprising technological gadgets, which they use daily."
10291,"Many people have now a poor memory. What is probably the reason and what should we do to improve? ""In the modern world, poor memory arises as a prevalent human condition. This essay will explore some probable causes for this brain degradation and its feasible solution. what affect our memorizing skills?","As the technology develops, people don't particularly need to memorise anything anymore. A human brain can no longer store as immerse data as a computer do. The technology makes it even easier when any social network like Facebook has now a function of reminding automatically the user of his friends' birthday or events. The dependence of technology weakens, therefore, human memory capacity. Ċ Besides, the increasing pollution makes this condition more universal. Research shows that people live in a heavily polluted area are more likely to struggle with memorising numbers and person's name than their peers in a purer region. Air pollution particles could attack anyone and happen to damage slowly brain functions. Ċ Solving these two main issues would be the key to recover intellectual health. While it is really difficult to change living area or individually mitigate environmental pollution, anyone can change their habit toward technology. Like physical body, the brain needs practice to function effectively. They should start with trying memorising important things like upcomming due dates or list of follows-up activities. Beside, finding a strategy to remember seems to be a long-term solution. Visualising the relationship between things could really facilitate the memorisation process. Ċ In brief, the modern life is seemingly creating a new generation of poor memory. However, with regular practice and an appropriate strategy, people would at least prevent themselves from the possible embarrassing situation where they would forget to celebrate their own birthday just due to Facebook disconnection."""
10292,Everyone has taken a risk at some time in his or her life. Write about a risk you have taken. Discuss why you took this risk and whether it was worth taking.,"Some people are eager taking risks on their life, feeling great for overcoming with the obstacles. Others deny taking risk for their own safes. As for me, riding a motorcycle in Vietnam without a permit was my tremendous risk. Ċ I remember last summer I took a vacation trip to Vietnam for visiting my grandmother's hometown. Motorcycles and bicycles were the mainly transportation in Vietnam. Unfortunately, international driving permits and the U.S drivers' licenses were not valid in Vietnam; nevertheless, the processing for applying a driving permit was complicated, so I decided to rent a motorcycle for my transportation without the permit during my staying. Ċ Riding a motorcycle in Vietnam was extremely dangerous. The traffic was chaotic. There were poor road conditions with uneven pavement. I was almost making an accident when I bumped into a big hole on the road. I didn't even see any speed limit or yield signs on the way. In addition, motorbike riders and pedestrians didn't obey traffic's rules. The traffic moved on the right, but drivers frequently crossed to the left to pass other vehicles and pedestrians who crossed the road illegally. Paying attention and concentrating were very much to do for my riding. It was highly anxious when I had to prepare to break frequently because other drivers sudden stop anytime. Ċ Consequently, everything that I had done was a risk and it wasn't worth taking. Yet, the possible outcome could be harmful to my safety. I might end up my life in a motorcycle accident or I might kill a pedestrian with my inexperience driving."
10293,In many countries it is now illegal to advertise alcohol. Do you agree or disagree? Advertising alcoholic should be banned,"Smoking is one of crucial social problems, but alcohol also becomes major concern because many countries have prohibited all the ads of that. It is agreed to ban the companies to promote alcohol due to the detrimental effects on our body and the power of media to influence consumers. Ċ Advertising alcoholic should be banned because it is harmful to human health. Drinking to much causes some serious illness such as liver cancer, diabetes, and heart diseases. Despite the utility to warm our body, most people consume alcohol only for entertaining and finally have terrible end. For instance, Indonesia has huge problem with alcoholism and many men were dying because of it, but after the government restrict the promotion of alcoholic at television, newspaper, and internet, it is resulted a significant reduction of such cases. Ċ In addition, it is inevitable that ads could persuade someone to buy more alcohol. This strengths of promotion could danger innocent people who might try alcohol as well as the addict ones. The main goal of any advertisement is to sell more, and the irresponsible part is when they distort the fact by only mentioned the positives and cut the drawbacks. I often saw billboards with a picture of handsome guy who drink beer accompanied by pretty and sexy women to show that drinking alcohol is cool and enjoyable in many billboards for example. The ads never talked about the danger impact for long term huge consumption. Ċ In conclusion, if a country want to drop the number of drinkers, they should restrict the alcohol ads for the sake of community health. So, what can society do? They could support the government, and be critical of exaggerated promotion."
10294,"Learning English at school is often seen as more important than learning local language. If these are not taught many are at risk of dying out. In your opinion, is it important for everyone to learn English? Should we try to ensure the survival of local languages and, if so, how?","Nowadays English has gained popularity in schools which, to some extent has overpowered the usage of vernacular. If such a practice is not checked, local languages may go to the verge of extinction. In my opinion, learning English is vital in today's era. Nevertheless, at the same time, we cannot ignore the importance of our mother tongue. Ċ To begin with, there can be a number of reasons for everyone to study English. The first reason could be, it is universally used as a means of communication in major working industries. For instance, a person with having knowledge of the language can be eligible and could opt for a job anywhere across the globe. Moreover, a great amount of information is written and accessible in English. Knowing the jargon, an individual can get access to a vast amount of data. Ċ Despite the fact English is favoured by many as a means of communication, one ought to try to protect the waning rate of native vocabulary, not only for its verbal usage but also to preserve its rich heritage. The local speech is a part of national treasure and identity. Thus, its' state cannot be ignored and should be under control. For example, in the past, many nations lost their identity and disappeared because they started speaking only in a foreign language. This potential threat could be prevented by effective policy from the authorities. Firstly, the medium of instruction in school should be in local accent and English can be treated as a subject. Secondly, a person who is linguistic should have higher priorities in the labour market. So, that more and more people can be motivated to learn their local language. Ċ To conclude, bearing in mind the above information and deliberating all facts, it can be deduced that although it is believed that English is necessary to succeed in all walks of life as it makes one more confident; however, both international as well as native languages, need to be respected equally. Equal efforts should be made by the public to learn both languages either international or local."
10295,Many office authorities impose a restriction on smoking within the office premises. Some governments have even banned smoking in all public places. This is a good idea but it takes away some of our freedom. What are your opinions.,"Considering the health of smokers, governments and some corporations are taking steps to restrain people from smoking publicly and in work premises. A few sections of society think that this is a positive movement of authorities, however, others argue that such initiatives will curb their freedom. In my opinion smokers should be allowed to smoke in designated areas away from public and this essay will discuss various reasons for my standpoint. Ċ Firstly, smoking significantly affects the fitness and is the biggest cause of oral and lung cancer. Even the secondhand smokers, people who inhale smoke release by smokers, are equally prone to the diseases. For example, in a country like America, designated smoking areas are built and smoking in public places is banned and fines are imposed if anyone is found using cigarettes in public place. Therefore, looking at the enormous risk, smokers and non- smokers should be segregated. Ċ However, some believed that restricting people from smoking in public and office places is an unfavourable regulation and has taken away some of their rights. Smokers argue that cigarette smoking has direct relation to their workplace performance as a result, such restrictions will disturb their daily life. For instance, it has noticed that many employees just leave the organization just because it puts high rules for a smoker. Hence, the compete restrain should not be implemented all of sudden and the smokers should be given the chance to quit the smoking habit. Ċ In conclusion, due to various health related problems, the regulations bring by many authorities will put a positive impact on society. On the other hand, if alternative smoking location made available, smoking can be banned at all public locations without making any controversy."
10296,a new job - consider the money only? It is sometimes said that a high salary is the most important factor in choosing a job.Do you agree or disagree?,"In modern time, looking for an excellent job can enhance one's quality of life. Most people believed that hight salary is the key element in all reason. I disagree with this point. The statement will be addressed Ċ One of the most controversial issues related to high revenue can not enough afford the extra expense. This is due to the fact that lots of enterprises concentrate in the business zone of the city which offers high payment to absorb competent staff from other places so that people's expenditure will increase in traffic, rent of house and price of a commodity. In addition, it is difficult to save the deposit for other plans in the future. According to the news, some employee who lives in the city should spend 15years to own house without eating and playing. As a result, their income almost equal to livelihood who live in there. It is a challenge to balance a successful career and a comfortable life. Ċ There is no doubt that a wide range of development of career is more critical than a high salary. The main idea behind this is, the company's culture and regulation affect their talent and value in the workplace. Furthermore, strong resource and personal training is an invisible wealth to increase their profession. It is common to see that a successful company gives staff more opportunity to express their mind and accept innovation. They not only earn money but also obtain achievement. Ċ Given the above statement, it is reasonable to conclude that choosing the job is not just consider the money. In my point of view,I believe that saving and development will affect one's ability in workplace."
10297,"TASK:In many countries, the young generation has lost interest in the teaching profession. What are the factors and what would be the solution.","Since the dawn of time, teachers have proven their importance in the area of education. However, as generations have passed, it is apparent that for some reasons students have lost their interest in pursuing a career in teaching. Ċ Ever since technological developments were made, the roles of educators were gradually replaced by the provision of computers. Many internet users have felt greater convenience on learning lessons through online materials. Thus, this has led most people to believe that the teaching profession would become obsolete in the near future. Apart from that theory, many have also regarded teaching as a low-paying job compared to other careers. An instance of this is commonly observed in countries like Philippines, wherein most of the graduates from educational courses end up having jobs in the call center industry. They took a course in education for the sake of having a higher qualification, and then aim a profession from a different field which has more attractive incentives. Ċ In the goal of preserving and renewing the teaching profession, the state should consider in implementing some amendments to rectify the situation. First of all, salary levels of educators should be raised not only to motivate the existing teachers, but also inspire the students. Secondly, teaching methods should be revised to incorporate modernization of technology with the role of educators. With the use of advanced machines, teachers could focus more on other areas to further improve the standard of learning. Ċ Although many things may have changed in the modern world, it is still an undeniable fact that society still needs the help of teachers. Moreover, it is yet too far that their purpose would be replaced by machines. Therefore, any possible means should be taken to encourage the young in taking up this profession."
10298,"In some parts of the world, people have become more focused on themselves than their communities. What problems can this situation cause and how can they be solved?","In the contemporary era, the public only thinks of themselves rather than their surrounding population as everyone has their own world of responsibilities or work. This trend has myriad negative ramifications such as antisocial community and globally affected societies.This essay intends to discuss these reasons followed by some viable measures for the same with relevant illustrations. Ċ The first and foremost problem of this issue that an individual focus only on himself these days is advancement in technology. Everybody is busy with their own devices without having a knowledge of surrounding areas and people living around them whether relatives or neighbours; hence, lead to the rise of the isolated nation. Moreover, there are some activities that society perform often; however, they do not realize that they can be dangerous. Smoking tobacco, for example, there are millions of folk who smoke every minute and throw its ashes butt away, which, in ,turn produces an inordinate amount of toxic litters on our planet. Consequently, it not only harmful to the present generations but also a bigger threat to the future of the earth. Ċ Some steps should be taken to mitigate this problem to diminish the above-mentioned effects. The prominent one is gathering with the family members as well as friends. In other words, the events should be held in societies where a group of people can interact and get a chance to socialize with the different communities. Celebrating festivals, for an instance, the western countries, celebrate their popular festive together regardless of having regular communication among them. Another considerable step is that law enforcement agencies should make stringent laws on the harmful habits that humans perform unintentionally or intentionally so that they could not affect our population and environment. Ċ To conclude, although some human beings are more persuaded by the advancements in technology and their excess usage which leads to the isolated community as well as they are into negative traits which affect our earth and the people residing on it, some effective steps such as implementing harsh rules and social events can lead to family cohesiveness and harm-free environment."
10299,I am planning to take the IELTS test. Here is one of my essay. I really need to improve my writing skills in order to get the best preparation for the IELTS test. Topic:It is generally acknowledged that families now are not as close as they used to be. What are some possible reasons for this and what can be done to reserve the trend. deteriorated family bonds,"Given the over-increasing pace in modern life, it seems common in many places that family bonds have been deteriorated. In my opinion, some possible ways could be done to minimize the downside of the issue. Ċ To start with, there are many ways in which this unfavorable situation could occur. The primary factor probably is the intrusion of modern technology into family life. In the past, family members were more likely to interact with each other as there were fewer technological diversions. However, in today's life, each member within a family could easily be distracted from family conversation by many hi-tech devices such as smartphones or tablets. Another factor leading to this trend probably is the over-increasing pace of the modern life. Given the fact that people tend to rush through things to ensure an advantageous position in the face of stiff competition, therefore, the closeness between family members would eventually suffer. Ċ However, it is true that many ways could be done to tackle this matter. One of the most promising ones could be ensuring that family members spend sufficient time together and enhance healthy interactions among them. For example, parents may try to reduce the time spent on technological devices at home, such as setting time restriction for Internet usage or arrange more time to chat or play with their child. More importantly, parents should always remember that they are working for a better life with their loved ones, not living to work. Ċ In conclusion, although there are many reasons for the undermining of family's closeness in today's life, I believe that great efforts from both parents and children are likely able to reserve this trend."
10300,Foreign languages are taught in all levels of schools and other educational institutions. Do you think this is a positive or negative development? What can we do to prevent the loss of our mother tongue?,"Nowadays, we can learn foreign languages in all levels of schools and some educational institutions. Personally, I agree with the idea that it is a positive development thought it may impact our mother tongue, and I believe that various we can do to prevent the drawbacks. Ċ Learning foreign languages can benefit people a lot in modern world. To begin with, every language brings its own culture and it is an asset of human beings, learning other languages can help us to enrich our horizons and develop our intelligence, imagination and creativity. People who speak more than one language can have a better career development. They have more chances to get a job in the international companies or work in different locations around the world, which also motivate them to be success in their career. As a result, it is a positive development that foreign languages education is spread among the people. Ċ However, if one language is dominant, the other languages may disappear, we should protect our own languages though we are encouraged to learn foreign languages. The government should develop some polices to ensure mother language is used in schools and the mainstream media. Besides, we should preserve our own culture and strengthen the ethnic cohesion through education. For instance, school can hold some activities, like visiting the historical museum, to let students to learn more about the history. The last thing we can do is to make our country stronger and improve the economic strength. Ċ In conclusion, it is a good trend that foreign languages learning are spread among the people. To prevent the drawbacks of the foreign languages, we should protect our own languages as well as the cultures through government policies, education and the economic strengthen."
10301,Many people believe that the world’s most urgent problems can only be solved by international collaboration. Ċ Do you agree or disagree?,"Some people think that most serious issues can be only resolved by international collaboration. To my mind, by uniting our best minds we are more likely to achieve considerable progress. So, it is agreed with the provided statement and this essay will discuss two main reasons why. Ċ Firstly, I would like to show the UN's impact in stopping armed conflicts throughout all its existence. Many bloody and relentless wars are being stopped by this well-known international organization because opposing and neighbouring governments are not always able to do that. For instance, the war in Yugoslavia was ended due to constant negotiations between more than 500 influential peacemakers from all over the world. UN members' initiatives and cooperation always constrain us from ending up killing each other. Ċ Secondly, let's discuss climate change and how politicians from different countries are fighting against this now. Great success was achieved in cleaning the Earth's atmosphere and world ocean by acknowledging the international standards of manufacturing and recycling. For instance, European ecologists state that the air became clearer by the end of 2021 for the first time since 2000 only after the European countries established some strict regulations. This fact shows that the best minds should work together to make our world a better place for everyone. Ċ To conclude, I would like to say that global issues require professionals from every state since they are called that way. It can be clearly seen that the more we unite the better society we will build for future generations."
10302,"Nowadays schools should not use textbooks because children get bored with books. Using games, computers and TV is a better way to give them new information and knowledge. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","At the beginning, there is no doubt that we should introduce an effective method to teach children. In this regard, some people believe that digital learning processes and games are the best way to guide the pupils. However, personally, I believe that these kind of methods can be additional materials for the studying process, and there are cannot substitute old teaching method, which is based on textbooks. Ċ On the one hand, it is handy and comfortable to conduct lectures on textbooks. They provide us with valuable learning materials throughout the academic year, and they do not depend on electricity and internet. Furthermore, paper-based training materials are available for almost the entire population of the Earth. For instance, there are many regions, such as Africa and Asia, where citizens have not an access to the internet. In this regard, many individuals are not keen to choose them. Ċ On the other hand, using games, computers and interactive whiteboard may envelop children's cognitive development. They can increase school pupils' interest in subjects, because it is an effective way to deliver information. Moreover, during the games, they may find it easy to gain knowledge about the specific topics. For example, many developed countries teach their students, using the methods, such as e-learning or distance learning, and in this sense it is comfortable to use new technologies for them. Ċ To conclude, it is true that the modern world is developing faster than before, and advanced technologies and intellectual games may replace our paper-based study process. However, I believe that textbooks are beneficial to guide the students, as universities are willing to develop students self-study process."
10303,Technological developments leads to lots of environmental issues. Some people think a simple life style can preserve the environment. While others argue technology itself can solve it. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"Advancements in automation create plenty of climate problems. Due to this reason, many opine that simple policy of living deter this issue, while others contend that by using technology in a positive approach solve this problem. I will like to articulate my view in further paragraphs along with a rational conclusion. Ċ To commence with, Rise in machinery leads to many losses to the climate as the new innovation in the fields of transport stimulate the individuals to purchase captivating vehicles which eventually result in the loss of natural resources and surging pollution levels through the gases released by petrol or diesel. Moreover, an increase in the temperature level due to the continuous cutting of saplings for the construction of roads and bridges leads to global warming. For example, research by the University of Punjab address that in upcoming years, there will be no land available in Delhi due to the increasing population as numerous people from all over India has migrated there in search for the job provided by new advanced hi-tech companies. Thus, the local village area might be used to construct buildings. Ċ On the contrary, the persons who opine to conserve the surrounding with the aid of automation often say that, firstly, some of the improvements in machinery sector protect the surroundings in many ways such as better and environmentally-friendly types of equipment are created which provide prevention from the harmful gases which come from the industries. Secondly, the new water-purification programs have developed which facilitate pure-drinking water to all the nation. For instance, the government in Punjab initiated a scheme in 2018 to distribute the chemical-free water in all areas which directly comes from the dam. Ċ To conclude, I opine that technology amelioration has might lead to many outcomes which affect habitation in a detrimental way and which stimulates some people to adopt a simple lifestyle. although, if it may be used in a positive way then surely it will help to conserve the environment."
10304,"The main purpose of public libraries is to provide books, and they should not waste their limited resources and space on providing expensive hi-tech media such as computer software, videos and DVDs. Ċ Discuss both views with example.","The 20th century has come along with numerous developments such as the digitization, IT revolution and the internet, and these phenomena have upgraded the educational support system such as libraries. Traditionally, the libraries used to keep the books, but now due to lightening-fast internet services modern libraries have more multimedia resources namely, CDs, DVDs and computers. Some critics assert that books should be the primary source of knowledge in the libraries, whereas the others believe that they should be equipped with laptops and computer devices. The essay will discuss both these aspects followed by a conclusion. Ċ The most compulsive reason for enhancing the libraries with the multi-media resources is that the space occupied by them is very less as compared to books. In other words, a single computer or laptop can store the contents of all books in the form digital information; consequently, the operational cost will be lower. The public library of Delhi, for instance, drastically lowered its cost of operation by swapping one rack of books by laptops with internet connection, in addition to this the number of visitors doubled in a month. Furthermore, as the books become older they start to catch the moisture and dust, thereby the content becomes difficult to read, whereas the digital content on the hard drives of desktops is safe for a lifetime. Ċ On the other hand, since the modern concept of libraries came in the last few decades, therefore the laptops or desktops cannot be used by older age groups as proficiently as by the younger generations. For example, the public library of Chennai as an experiment closed the books section for a month and opened a free internet section. They found that the number of people with age group greater than forty decreased by 90%, while the number teenagers doubled within that month. Moreover, excessive use of mobile phones or laptops for activities like games or studies has an adverse effect on the eyesight, so the book as a medium to study is still a crucial component of one's academic life. Ċ To conclude, one must adopt the most suitable way to study depending upon his requirement. The digital transformation can help the quick and easy access to the latest developments around the globe. So, one must adopt new methods to gain access to upcoming research."
10305,Playing a musical instrument is one of the most important achievements for any child. To what extent do you agree with this statement? Learning how to play a music,"The role of music in our life is widely debated, with some people claim that every child should master at least a music instrument. Personally, I agree with this viewpoint, and I will explain why in this essay. Ċ Firstly, playing music acts as a precursor to a child's mental development. It is true to argue that learning any musical instruments, let alone mastering one, is time-consuming, tedious and requires constant efforts. Hence, through the learning process, children may inadvertently acquire patience and diligence, making learning more complicated things such as subjects much easier. Secondly, playing musical instruments is a healthy way of entertainment. Compared to children who spend hours straining their eyes at computer or mobile phone screens, other who consider playing music a hobby are proved to rarely have to suffer from any types of eye disorders. Finally, strange as it may sound, when it comes to one's adolescence and adulthood, the ability of being master in any musical instruments can make him stand out of the crowd and draw admiration. Ċ I do understand the opposing view that getting a child to learn such tough thing as musical instruments from an early age may cause mental damages. Long tiring days of hard training with an instrument without any likelihoods that he would be able to master it may render loss in confidence and self-belief. However, this does not always happen and can be fixed by a loosened timetable or consistent encouragements from teachers and parents. Ċ To conclude, I believe that the ability of playing musical instruments is conducive to any child and should be acquire from an early age. Above all, though, I think that the learning instrument process needs to be a gradual process, based on careful support rather than undue pressure."
10306,"Nowadays, most large companies operate multinationally. To what Ċ extent those companies should have responsibility towards local Ċ communities in which they operate?","In recent years, there has been a trend of offshore expansion of multinational corporations. Although, this will create many employments for the local citizens, their responsibilities towards environment must be the highest level. Ċ It is true that the responsible corporate behaviours contribute to broad-based benefits towards the countries in which they are active. Firstly, since these corporations have had the responsibility towards the habitat, which lead to beliefs of the local people with these brands. For instance, if a company have steps to disposal wastes then the citizens enjoy their new products without concerns with environment. Secondly, the multinational companies should be more active in charitable activities that are the opportunities for them to save the lives oversea. In fact, many nations all around the world do not have the resources to deal with the problems, such as poverty or hunger, so they need a lot of helps of the companies. Ċ On the other hand, the foreign companies can substantially benefit from being socially responsible. By actively protecting the habitat that ensures their sustainable long-term growth, especially manufacturing and mining factories. For example, the coca-cola company had many campaigns of improving climate, therefore they are received such supports from the locals and government. Furthermore, the multinational corporations should be very conscious of their track records when it comes to local responsibility, as these are directly tied to brand names. As a result, if the brand name is remained and enhancing, which is conditioned conductive to increasing the profit and sales. Ċ In conclusion, the corporate responsibilities towards local communities should always be high. This benefits not only the countries in which companies operate, but the companies themselves."
10307,We are becoming increasingly dependent on computer–based technology. How do you think it will change in the future? Is it good for us to rely so much on computers?,"An extremely significant topic today is related to the dependency on computers and other technologies. Even though computers are relatively new inventions, they have become an indispensable part of our lifestyles. In this essay, I am going to elaborate on the future prospects of technology and whether we can benefit from using it. Ċ To begin with, in my opinion, technologies have a promising future. The majority of people today use not only household appliances but also some modern devices such as smartphones, the Internet, etc. This can serve as a proof for the fast pace of electronics development. New occupations are created, for example, programmers and software engineers, who are making innovations in the sphere of computer science. Even so, the dependency of technologies is already detected by many psychologists and many of them are evolving their knowledge of how technologies are affecting our neurological system. Therefore, in the future, they will find a way to treat our digital dependence. Ċ On the other hand, it is not acceptable to rely on computers all the time. Computers provide us with information and knowledge. Nevertheless, recently conducted research shows that they cause us “digital dementia”. “Digital dementia” is a term used to define our disability to remember information, which we could do if we do not overuse our modern devices. For instance, the overuse of the World Wide Web makes us too dependable and we are less likely to think logically. This is because the information is given beforehand and we take it for granted. By doing this , we decrease our memory and concentration abilities. Ċ To summarise , I firmly believe that although computers give us numerous benefits, eventual revolutions will certainly exceed our expectations. However, even if those prospects are extremely appealing to us, we should remain responsible and never use them too much."
10308,"We cannot help everyone in the world that needs help, so we should only be concerned with our own communities and countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is often believed by some that helping others should be restricted to one's own community or nation, as it is not possible to help each and every one. I completely disagree with this notion and I believe efforts should be made, to provide help to as many as possible. Ċ On the one hand, I agree we always find people, around us, who are in need of help. Assisting them and providing help to them in any form would mean a world to them. These days, even the wealthiest nation have homeless people and any charity or volunteer work would benefit them a lot. For example, people in many countries donate their old clothes and other belongings to various homeless people or even to certain non-profit organizations. As the problems persist locally, I can understand why some people give more priority to local charity. Ċ At the same time, I believe we shouldn't limit ourselves to the national borders. Today the world consists of many rich and poor nations and the richer nations should take a step forward by helping the impoverished lot. For example during various natural calamities, poorer nations could benefit a lot from the aid or help received by the richer nations. This would not only help them to recover, but will also help them in getting back to their feet. Ċ In conclusion, the whole human race, first are citizens of planet Earth and then of any country. Thus, helping someone in need, shouldn't be differentiated on the basis of international borders."
10309,"In many countries, the number of animals and plants are declining. Why do you think is it happening? How to solve this issue?","It is true that the population of plants and animals is decreasing in many countries. There could be several reasons why this is happening, and I believe that technology and human activities are the main causes. Ċ There are various reasons why plants and animals are decreasing in number. Firstly, deforestation has some critical effects on both plants and animals. As human-kind constructsAdd a comma,constructsIt appears that you are missing a comma after the introductory phrase As human-kind constructs. Consider adding a comma. Ċ show examples more buildings and consumes more wood, the trend of deforestation has boomed in recent decades. As a consequence, the living areas of wild animals have shrunk and this has resulted in lowering the number of animals. Secondly, climate changes are a threat to both animals and plants. For example, global warming is the main reason for seasonal fires that happen in the North of Iran. Finally, hunting and capturing wild animals has a direct effect on their population. Ċ In my view, using green energies instead of fossil fuels could be practical in controlling global warming. Car companies had to engage new technologies and made the use of green energies like Solar energy be practical. Moreover, governments should set more severe laws against hunters and companies who cut the trees illegally. Unfortunately, in third world countries like Iran, there are many bands that trade the trees freely while it is against the laws. Also, public awareness should be increased through education, TV programs or celebrities' efforts. There are many figureheads like Bill Gates, who is trying to inform people about endangered plants and animal species. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that via some basic activities the population of both animals and plants could be controlled."
10310,Some findings have revealed that cities around the world are growing large. Could you outline the possible causes and predict consequences?,"In recent years, there has been a growing tendency that the urban sprawl is a common phenomenon in many countries. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the forces behind this trend and its consequences. 34 Ċ To begin with, population growth is widely accepted as the primary reason. Nowadays the space in the city centre is unlikely to provide sufficient housing availability to accommodate an ever-growing population. Besides, in order to offer lower-density living environment to local city residents, an ongoing land development towards surrounding suburbs is deemed as an preferential solution. Moreover, another problem that has intensified in the inner city is infrastructure shortage and poor conditions of buildings. Lack of amenities such as water supply and waste disposal have left no choice to urban dwellers but to resettle in the suburbs, where they have easier access to new facilities. 104 Ċ However, the sustained expansion of cities will make a marked impact on the society in several dimensions. Firstly, a high traffic volume between outer city and downtown causes severe air pollution and reduce the lands suitable for farming. Also, the enlargement of cities requires massive developments which make some areas to lose its unique qualities and traditional characteristics. Secondly, from the economic perspective, the relocation of a large population towards suburbs will pose adverse fiscal impact on the local government's infrastructure overhead. Furthermore, from the individual aspect, for those who are usually reside in suburbs, the inflow of new inhabitants will damage the community sport and make relations between neighbours fragile. 109 Ċ In conclusion, urban sprawl is a trend which exerts several negative effects. Therefore, the government should organise detail planning and sustainable development to minimise its demerits. 26 / 273"
10311,"We can not help everyone in the world that needs help, so we should only be concerned with our own communities and countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement ? Prioritize most important issues","Nowadays, many people have problems with discrimination, poverty and health care... so receiving help from others is very precious to them. From my point of view, I disagree with the idea that we should not help people in other countries since those problems still exist in our own society. Ċ Although only one person cannot manage to deal with every problems of other people from the rest of the world, co-operation of many individuals can create enough strength to tackle global issues,and that helps promote not only particular country but also the entire society. There is many counterexample against the notion that one cannot break national boundaries to help neighbours and fellow citizens. Take Nelson Mandela as an example, he is though to be a failure before succeeding in abolishing the racial prejudice and fighting for justice with the help of the color community and soon became a symbol of peace to South African people and also residents who live beyond his national border. Ċ As a consequence of globalization , considering the purpose of a nation to be a priority can only separate itself from others. Instead of that, our dedication and contribution should reach the common goals at an international level in an attempt to achieve sustainable development. For instance, poverty tends to appear more in developing countries so it is a responsibility for governments from developed nations to come up with a measure that helps the poor raise their living standard regardless of nationality. Besides, most of the social issues do not belong to any specific country so it is our duty to help each other for the sake of a better world. Ċ In conclusion, I believe even if we are not able to help everyone in the world who are in need, it is selfish of us to only care for people nearby where we are living."
10312,The international community must act immediately to ensure all nations reduce consumpation of fossil fuel (gas and oil). To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is often said that one of the most important responsibilities for the international community is ensuring all nations reduce the consumption of fossil fuels such as gas and oil. From my point of ,view, I completely agree with this idea. Ċ Firstly ,one of the conspicuous reasons for this argument is ,to conduct this operation by the international community the amount of pollution to be diminished. For example ,in most industrial countries such as India which is one of the biggest producers of coal in the world ,we all know in most of its cities there is a high pollution level also ,people regularly suffer from respiratory problems. This means that to conduct some activities in order to reduce the use of fossil fuel these problems can be diminished. Also ,they will disappoint in the near future. Therefore ,this makes it clear why the consumption of fossil fuels should be reduced in addition to stopping. Ċ Secondly ,another reason is protecting animals ,especially those are endangered species such as Cheetas and Lizards. For instance ,most of the population in the world prefer to use their personal vehicles instead of exploiting bikes and public transport systems. This could create a dire situation for all animals because of burning fossil fuels by our cars. This would cause they will become extinct. As a result to legislate a rule that consuming fossil fuel should be diminished international community can create a place for all creatures to live on the Earth safely. Ċ To summarise ,I strongly believe that exploiting gas and oil should be reduced even halted. It is predicted that to do this operation our world will proceed to become a suitable place for living without any trouble in the near future."
10313,Nowadays people around the world are choosing to self-medicate rather than seeing a doctor and using conventional medicine. What are the growth of self-medicate could be a serious issue all over the world.,"Today, many citizens in the world often self-medicate at home instead of going to the doctor and using conventional medicine. This essay will give the cause and effect of the problem. Ċ There are many reasons why people believe in self-healing at home. Firstly, people often don’t want to minimize costs. Because if the people go to the doctor, they will pay double hospital fees and drug bills. So they choose to go to the drug store near their house and buy medicine. For example, the citizens only pay 10$ for drugs when they self-medicate but going to the doctor, they will pay 20$ for the doctor and 20$ for drugs. Moreover, they want to be inconvenient in commuting. Because when sick people are too tired, they often just like to lie down in one place and sleep. From those reasons, it can be understood why they often choose self-medication. Ċ However, those causes also have a great impact on their health. To begin with, they may buy the wrong drugs. Because the patient doesn’t know their exact illness and buys the right medicine to use. For instance, if they feel a headache, just buy headache medicine without knowing it was the symptoms affecting the nerves. Next, when they are sick and just want to lie down will make their illness worse. Because if not functioned and treated properly, it will make the body more and more weak and tired. So, the effect of not going to the doctor is small, but it can have serious health consequences later in life. Ċ In conclusion, the growth of self-medication could be a serious issue all over the world. It could be the result of minimizing costs and inconvenient commuting, which adversely affects their health and makes the illness worse."
10314,"Music is played in every society and culture in the world today. Some people think that music brings only benefits to individuals and societies. others, however, think that music can have a negative influence on both. Discuss both these views and give your opinions.","In the modern era, music has become one of the most conspicuous trends for almost every culture and society. My essay will discuss both positive and negative perspectives using a pragmatic approach. Ċ To commence with, singing helps someone to relax and to get peace of mind especially when they are depressed or disturbed by unexpected realities of life. Several societies in today's world are using lyric in their religions for case Christianity. The latest research conducted by Western Sydney University revealed that 90 per cent of participants acknowledged that they listen or attracted to lyrics when they want to divert their attention or to swing their moods. Listening to singing in other languages can help to increase your ability to understand that specific language. This can also help to get familiar with the art and culture presented by singers. Ċ On the other hand, songs have some bad impact on the listeners in different ways. Some persons relate singers lyrics and videos with their real-life and start assuming the things in a wrong way which consequently change the belives of the community about life and make them hopeless. Furthermore, Listening to songs for long periods can distract someone from their studies or work which can lead to other problems for example infection in the ears. Moreover, Music has a great variety so it can bring a person to loneliness or sadness if they had experienced something bad. When most humans are doing such things definitely it leaves the worst impression on society. Ċ In my opinion, if we maintain a balance in listening to the melody and keep it away from our personal lives, its a good thing. For instance, we should listen to songs in our free time only as fun. Ċ To conclude, as the melody plays a vital role to get relax and peaceful mind. However, this can make someone feel sad as well."
10315,"In countries with a high rate of unemployment, numerous pupils should do offered only predominant education. There is no point in offering secondary education to those who have no hope of finding a job. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.","Job scarcity has remained a significant issue of numerous nations to concern with high unemployment percentage. The authority considered if the action it could staring soon will save more money, stopping investing and supporting secondary schooling after the public completed primary training. I am afraid I disagree with this view. Because educational institutions always play a vital role. At the same time, situations and circumstances may vary. The state should encourage and engage with as many populations as possible to complete high schools and universities. If this action is successful, the whole community will get in worse. Ċ First, future discipline is a crucial way to improve association moving to high efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, the community can, through knowledge, develop new technology to enhance population from a varied way to computing science even human intelligence improved nation work skills to enhance effect created max contribute for society. Moreover, better learning can encourage more and more social to become entrepreneurs or businessmen. Such as those entrepreneurs and the business crowd could create more job opportunities and positions to help the state improve the public’s life quality, even government tax income. Namely, The authority could use those TAX to continue investing and supporting secondary schooling to engage with numerous societies starting to study. Therefore secondary improvement is imperative for the whole state. Ċ Second, the educate has used their recognition to contribute to the community. And it is enhancing society in particular fields to help the population far away from criminal and health problems. For example, the educate could use their observation to teach the nation how to save capital through investing to earn more wealth. Also will be constructive to help the public get in better health issues. Convincingly without a second educational background, when the outlook is terrible, the government can save bills. It may be true in the short term. Nevertheless, it leaves the long-term issues of an undereducated and underdeveloped nation. Indeed this is not a sort of reliable solution. Ċ To summarize, secondary education is typically essential for the whole society, not just for someone who can not finish primary schooling. The authority often takes short-term sacrifice and investment to achieve long term prosperity. After all this analysis, therefore, It must not take shortcuts to enhance everyone receives a proper secondary culture. It is the surest way to create a better future for everyone."
10316,"The best way to get deep understanding about foreign cultures Some people think that it is necessary to travel abroad to learn about other countries, but other people think that it is not necessary to travel abroad because all the information can be seen at TV and the internet. Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","Considering the ongoing diversification in our society, people are now more interested to broaden their prospects about cultures of different nations. While many beleive that with the digital age, one can learn a lot about other countries without visit them, I would argue learning is possible but to a certain extend, it is required to visit the nations to fully learn about them. Ċ On the one side, with the rise in vlogging culture and the international Television Channels, it is possible to have first-hand experience about the life in any foreign country. The reason for this is, many vloggers record their whole day and post on the social platforms for others to experience their life. Especially within students, they can experience their whole day in foreign universities in advance without even visiting them. Furthermore, it has become a prevalent idea to install a 360 Degree on a tourist location and broadcast the feed on internet, which, as a result, allows people around the globe enjoy a virtual experience. Ċ Nevertheless, I would argue that although watching video's and reading blog is convenient but one cannot learn enough until they experience it in the real life. For illustration, it is not possible to learn a language by just reading books and listening tutorial, a pragmatic approach, such as interaction with native speaker's is required. Besides, internet lacks emotions. Argument goes that, eventhough their is plenty of information and clips available about nine-eleven, world trade center attacks, but you will only experience the real-pain and destruction after standing around ground zero. Ċ In conclusion, Despite the avalaibility of number of resource on internet to learn about any foreign destination, I beleive, physically presence is required to have the deep understanding about cultures and incidents."
10317,"Some people think young children can have better education in a boarding school far from home, while others claim that a day school is a better one.  Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","Some people stated that by sending young pupil far away from their home to boarding schools could help them learn better. Ċ In contrast, there are also parents that prefer day schools. This essay will discuss both views and give my own opinion on this issue. Ċ There is no deny that going to day schools could let children have more time spent with their families. Additionally, the tuition fees of such schools are often cheaper than boarding schools, which many families could afford every child to access to knowledge. However, the daily transportation cost might be high. Furthermore, it'd be also extremely time-consuming if the student has to travel between school and home twice a day. Ċ On the other hand, children of boarding schools could save their time for further studies as they don't need to travel around every day. Moreover, boarding schools usually provide various activities, such as cricket and netball, even after class. Such sports games could strengthen their spirits as well as their social skills. Despite having a chance to win both pride and honour, teaching the participants the correct attitude toward games or even life would be more important to pupils. Although boarding schools could help students form a stronger friendship between them, it may also cause serious homesick problems. However, I believe that the technology nowadays could reduce their anxiety by simply making a phone call back home. Ċ As far as I have concerned, studying in a boarding school or day school has both  advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, my opinion is that a better education is directly basing on the time students could devote. Therefore, boarding schools, which do not need to consume time on transportation, would be my preference."
10318,prevention vs treatment Question: The prevention of health problems and illness is more important than treatment and medicine. Government funding should reflect this. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued that preventing problems relevant to health is far more crucial than curing these problems. Basically, I side with this standpoint, however, the role of treatment can never be ignored. Ċ On the one hand, I believed that measures of avoidance are better than medicine in term of long-term benefits namely physical and mental health or economy. In general, using prevention not only help patient to avoid diseases or problems, but also enable them to reduce side-effect of drugs as well as incidental damages. Especially, operation in internal organs like brain or heart has a very high risk of disordering function of them in the future. Added to this is sense of disturbing for medicine user because vomiting and anorexia usually occur after taking pills. Furthermore, some kind of problem will require you to pay enormous expense if you are re-infected, meanwhile, vaccination has permanent effect. Ċ On the other hand, treatment has always been considered as an only choice when it comes to certain circumstances. Firstly, not every problem can be avoided with current technology. Taking ""Yasuo"" for example, it is known as an inborn disorder relevant to impairment of bones and the only way to prevent is fixing the original gens of human, a novel solution, therefore, studying medicine is more possible. Secondly, in fast-paced modern lifestyle, people are more incline to have poor diet and not to take periodical examination. As a result of lack of time and serious attention, avoidance is less effective than treatment, which is instantly powerful. Ċ In conclusion, government should invest money into both of prevention and medication due to the different of situation."
10319,"Topic: Smokers can cause themselves serious health problems. The choice to made freely and with knowledge of danger. Smokers should therefore, expect to pay more for medical treatment than non-smokers. To what extent do you agree with this statement?","Any person has the choice of being smoker or not. But, smoking is harmful for our health and may cause to damage themselves. Due to this smoking habit it may cause mainly respiratory problems and heart problems. This effects of smoking is educating through the media such as television, news papers, magazines etc., Hence, people who are involving this habit is already know about this danger, but they still enjoying with their habit. However, I do not entirely agree that these people should have to pay more to receive all the medial treatment they need. Ċ There are some situations, that do not have any relationship between the smoking habit. Then I believe that smokers should not be required to pay more than the non-smokers for their medical treatments. Car accident as a example, have no any connection with smoking, but people who injured from these type accidents may cause to serious injuries, also they might spend lots of money for recovery. Viral infections, another good example, any infected person needs to get the treatments and it is do not consider this infected person is smoker or not also the treatment charges are also same for both types. Ċ On the other hand, any smoker may have high possibility to take a treatment, which may cause to his smoking habit. These treatments need to pay lots of money than the non-smokers, because most of the cases of smokers are carcinoma cases. This is very harmful and have high possibility for death. They may have to suffer during their life time due to this smoking habit. Therefore, smoker have the responsibility for what he/her has been doing. Ċ In conclusion, I believe smoking persons should pay more in cases related to smoking, but in other cases they have to pay same as the others."
10320,"Nowadays, most people are not as fit and active as they were in the past. What are the main causes of this situation? Suggest some possible solutions","There is no doubt that the role of being physically adept and active plays a crucial role in people's lives. However, in recent years, most of the individuals have not been fitted compared to people from the past century. This essay, therefore, will explore a couple of reasons that might cause this above-mentioned situation and highlight pertinent measurements accordingly. Ċ First and foremost, many urban and sub-urban residents have been leading a comfortable life, whereas their ancestors had to engage in manual activities to meet the basic necessities, following the hand-to-mouth strategy. This is indeed unfortunate cause the technological disruption has erased the scope to involve in productive activities not only mentally, but also physically. To give an illustrative example, a recent Harvard University study revealed that a myriad automated sewing machine have curtailed South Asian garment workers' manual working hours by almost half in the last decade. So, formal organisations ought to mandate a particular hour of exercise or so that public and private employees are bound to follow in order to keep themselves fit. Ċ Another concern is that a number of citizens are getting addicted to their electronic gadgets, which are demotivating outdoor activities. This is because many popular games, such as football, cricket, and so forth used to be the primary source of entertainment and now the recreational sector has been captured by technology companies. For instance, many professional players are strictly prohibited to use their smartphones during any series or campaign because of their much-needed concentration on the game. Thus, a culture of rules and regulations in a community would force people to revamp their tech-based mentality. Ċ In conclusion, numerous people are getting used to their safe and enjoyable life, which is even limited to, electronic devices and this attitude has been gearing towards the unhealthy lifestyle and more health complications. This is why strict policies, both from institutions and communities might trigger some fruitful outcomes for this generation."
10321,Some students like classes where teachers lecture (do all of the talking) in class. Others prefer classes where students do some of the talking. Which type of class you like? Why?,"In the last few years, there have been many reformation in my own country' education system, and one of the most outstanding changes is in teaching method. In stead of lectures where teachers talk all time, there are now always some presentations made by students during the class. Personally, I thinks these reformations have made education system in my country better, and this new teaching method is not good for me, but for most students. Ċ To begin with, when students attend tuitions, they can have more chance to upgrade their own capabilities. In order to finish the topic which their teachers give them, they have to work in group, read many kinds of different material, collect data for their presentation. When they work together in group, they can learn skill for working together, which very useful for them not just during college, but after school. They also can improve their reading skill and technique to gather information. Ċ In addition, making representation front of crowd help them become more confident. For example, when I was a student at high school, I always became nervous whenever speaking front of class. However, thanks to new teaching method, now I do not mind speaking in front of crowd. Ċ Last but not least, the new teaching method make lecture more interesting for students. In class, students can discuss some things involved subjects, they have more chance to express their own ideas."
10322,"Topic: In many countries, when someone gets old, they often go to live in a house with other old people where there are nurses to look after them. Sometimes governments pay for this care. Who should be responsible for our old people? Use specific reasons and details to explain your choice.","Retirement homes appear to be the intriguing place for seniors in several develop countries like America, Australia, Britain, to name but a few, and this is sometimes at the expense of the government. Up till now, this issue has aroused a wide range of considerable debates. Some viewers believe that the expenditure incurred on this should be born by the government. However, in my view, the responsibilities should belong to young people in the families. Ċ Seniors are the young's parents who bring children up, so they deserve to be paid back in appropriate manner. In fact, caring for the aged is the natural rule that every children must take because as we are infants, those are our parents who spent and sacrificed their lives for the betterment and the upbringing of them. They give us love, knowledge and they teach us the first thing of the new world. Hence, it is obvious that the elderly should stay with young people. Ċ In addition, senior citizens are able to help their children in looking after grandchildren and doing housework. Albeit being old in age, their health is still high-quality and the brain also is astounding. In contrary, the youthful are not familiar with those advantages, they put their parents into old folks' house. Afterward, they take someone else who is so-called baby-sitter into their home. Naturally, they must to pay expenditure for them. Ċ Briefly, the families should take the responsibility to oversee old people. In this way, we are not only keeping them happy and satisfied but also teaching our young ones some good moral values."
10323,People who have original ideas are of much greater value to society than those who are simply able to copy the ideas of others well. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"I certainly agree with people who come up with new concepts. In other words, I think, those who have an ability of invent or discover new things are very pivotal to society as a whole. However, I also think there are some advantages of good imitators. Copying the ideas or new material which are invented by inventors or scientists is not good job, but, in my opinion, if it is useful for the locals then we need to copy it. Ċ The first thing I would like to mention is that no-one can that inventors and discovers must be thanked for providing us with acceptable items that we utilize every day. For example, without basic items such as the washing machine, the television and more recently the computers we cannot imagine our life. Ċ On the other hand, nowadays, the world we live in has become alarmingly oriented for consumers. Today, a lot of basic things are becoming constantly up-to-dated and improved. However, not everyone can buy them because of the price of these innovations. Moreover, not everyone lives in lands where have accessibility to the up-market items. That is why, it is more preferable to copy expensive materials to cheaper ones. Ċ It is valuable to add that certain innovations such as medical drugs have a serious impact on our lives rather than consumer goods. In my opinion, it cannot easily be replicated. For instance, vital medicine drugs such as penicillin and drugs against dangerous disease also invented by people with making great efforts to develop them. Ċ To sum up, I would like to say that scientists and innovators work extremely hard to make comfortable life for us. Furthermore, if people copy their ideas it helps them to get enough benefits."
10324,"Some people say that public libraries are an important public resource and should be free, others say that they are just a waste of public money.  Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Keeping public libraries open","It is commonly believed that libraries are essential public places and therefore should be no charge for people when entering these locations while some argue they only squander public money. In my opinion, government should continue to spend money on public libraries so as to ensure the distribution of knowledge for all people. Ċ Opponents who assume funding public libraries are kind of wasting money because they only see few people coming to these places. For example, Aksara library, state-owned library located in south Jakarta, opens from Monday to Saturday at 10a.m - 5p.m. But, the average number of people who come is merely 40 to 60 per week, which is very few people coming. As a result, they believe that it does not give any significant impact and solely squanders government's money. Ċ However, I would argue public libraries must be preserved regardless whether or not they waste public money. The problem is not about squandering money, but how government improving the interest of reading due to the fact knowledge is rights for people. By preserving public libraries and improving reading interest, it will vouch the equality in education for all people and generate many well-educated people that will be useful for the future government or country itself. In addition, if government does not support public libraries, it maybe causes such places have to close and government keeps struggling with the same issue, which is educational equity. Ċ To sum up, I do not believe spending money on public libraries is a waste. Therefore, another measure, such as enhancing reading interest, should be implemented in order to create educated people. Keeping public libraries remain available to all is the most appropriate course of action to maintain rights of people in education."
10325,Women are better at childcare than men therefore they should focus more on raising children and less on their working life. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"There is no doubt that raising the children is a laborious task and it needs undivided attention. While many from the older generations believe that women should be focusing on their upbringing, current generation argues that it is gender inequality and a combined effort from both the parents are necessary. I support the latter view, and, in this essay, I will elucidate the reasons for my argument. Ċ First and foremost, women are as successful as men at their work. There are many powerful women CEO’s who holds the fort for many successful multinational corporations. Therefore, the notion that only men are good at working and is not supported by relevant facts. For example, one interesting study conducted by Canadian Society on Women leaders shows that woman leaders tend to be more successful than their male companions. This shows that women are equally potent as men in any field of work in this modern world. Ċ On the other hand, the common belief that women are better suited for childcare is completely baseless. In other words, there are many families in this modern world, where men could successfully take care of the little ones. For instance, a survey conducted by a leading US newspaper shows that families are more successful where the workload is shared by both partners. Also, there are many daycares successfully run by men. Ċ To sum up, the upbringing of the children used to be wife’s chore in the previous century, but in modern societies, both parents share this responsibility and hence, I believe that it is more of a gender-neutral task now."
10326,"Human activities have had a negative effect on ecosystem, animals and plants across the world. Some people believe this can not changed while others feel that we can still take action to protect living things and the environment. Ċ Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Over the last few decades, anthropogenic has detrimentally affected the environment resulting in water, land, and air pollution. Some people insist that it's too late to alleviate the disastrous consequences of human activities, while others optimistically believe that the world can still be healed by several approaches. In this essay, both points of view will be discussed in detail, and my opinion to support the latter statement will be illustrated. Ċ On the one hand, it is apparent that the world has been decimated for many decades by human's hands including deforestation, contaminating soil and water with chemical substances from industrial and agricultural sectors, and releasing tons of Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuel to generate energy. Therefore, it may be too late to replenish natural resources. Moreover, approximately 90 per cent of vehicles including cars, planes, and ships still need fossil fuel for feeding the engines and driving the world economy, which is very difficult to change these things in reality. Ċ On the other hand, presumably, I believe that the world still have hopes and there are several approaches to alleviate the impacts of human activities. First of all, nowadays we have technologies and innovations which are eco-friendly such as electric cars and ships. Furthermore, the renewable and green energy generated from solar cells, turbines, and nuclear stations has recently been promoted in many countries. Additionally, cultivating more forests is one of the promising solutions that people recently implement for paying back the environment. For example, the authority of China try to expand the forest in desert areas called the great green wall to reduce soil erosion, and to promote carbon sequestration. Ċ In conclusion, as the aforementioned remedies including the advancement of technology and afforestation to mitigate the consequences of anthropogenic, I believe that it's not too late to recover the world's environment and we still have the natural resources for the next generation."
10327,"Rising university fees and limited employment prospects for graduates have led some people to say that universities should not teach arts subjects, like philosophy and history, and should only offer practical degree courses that maximise chances of employment. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Because of University fees increasing more and more and lower opportunities to find a job after graduation, some argue that arts subjects, such as philosophy and history should not be included in the offering of universities, instead they should only teach courses that give the best employment prospects. While it is true that having a degree does not mean one will find a job, I do not agree with this. This essay will discuss the vital importance of these subjects and demonstrate the practical use that sometimes people fail to recognise. Ċ First of all, studying the arts, history, philosophy or any other discipline, help and promote self-expression, offering alternative tools to communicate and create, which can boost confidence and encourage individuality. For instance, it is well known that art classes give students the chance to be themselves, and the freedom to create without having to follow strict rules. This allows the expression of different personalities and the use of people's full potentials that would be lost otherwise. Ċ Secondly, the study of philosophy and history helps develop critical thinking and the ability to analyse events or any other thing from the past to understand better our present, cultural differences, enjoy the beauty of a work of art and find the answers to the questions and doubts we have. For example, by learning and discussing historical events we make sure that mistakes already made by those who lived before us are not repeated. The ability to make sense of things around us that we acquire are good enough reasons to continue teaching them.  Ċ To conclude, I do not agree with those that say that universities should stop arts subjects courses, because they are a vital font of knowledge, they encourage people creativity and enables individuality and self-esteem."
10328,Topic: Human beings do not need to eat meat products in order to maintain a good health because they can get all their needs from meatless products and meatless substitutes. A vegetarian diet is as healthy as a diet containing meat. Argue for or against the opinion above.,"It is undeniable that at present time, a good health can be maintained without consuming meat products. In clarifying, people can fulfill all their needs by means of meatless foods. Many scientists hold an opinion that when it comes to vegetarianism, it can be considered as a healthy diet. However, others tend to think that meat products can be beneficial when it comes to avoiding monotonous type of diet. To the best of my opinion, it is more practical which is worthy of being paid attention, and it will be known within the scope of my essay. Ċ For a variety of reasons many people consider vegetarianism as a harmful trend. Firstly, people claim that vegetarians do not eat a balanced diet. As human organism is in need of organic food as well. Secondly, in many cultures, meat is the paramount ingredient in traditional meals. ""Kebab"", for instance, is one of the traditional foods of Uzbekistan, which consists of only meat. Finally, meat-eaters argue that animals are below humans in the food chain. Ċ On the other hand, there are some benefits of a meatless diet that can easily overwhelm its potential pitfalls. A majority of people choose vegetarian diet for moral and health reasons. It can reduce the risk of disease like cancer. Therefore, people claim that it is unnecessary to kill animals when it comes to getting food. Ċ Given these evidences, it can be clearly said that both vegetarian and meat-containing diets are to be kept when it comes to maintaining a good and stable health."
10329,Some believe that people will purchase a product based on their needs and advertising is not needed. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The question of whether advertisement serves no real purpose has become progressively contentious as some argue necessity is a driving force for all purchases. In my opinion, while their viewpoints seem legitimate, adverts help consumers develop needs for novelty. Ċ On the one hand, the most frequently cited rationale for the unnecessary ads is that consumers understand their demands when it comes to shopping. This argument rests on the fact that advertising can be rather a nuisance than a motivator influencing people's buying behaviours. For example, this can be most apparently seen in myriad supermarkets, which organise a wide breadth of product launches that spontaneously disturb their shoppers with obsolete goods. Most supermarket-goers know their needs when they enter the store and attracting them with a list of sponsorship deals could make them annoyed and refuse to come back again. Thus, the accumulated evidence has reasoned why ads should be solely present when consumers reach out to them. Ċ On the other hand, albeit conceding that customers are often aware of what they want, I would still contend that advertising does not simply meet needs but creates them. To begin with, this is predicated based on the assumption that people can have more fulfilling lives with innovative products which would benefit them in their daily activities. For instance, one of the salient illustrations of this is often indicated in the advent of Apple products dating back 10 years ago, which has brought in the frenzy for electronics like smartphones, tablets and earphones. Had they not utilised the role of advertising, they would not have fostered their dominance in the market like today and the desire of the citizenry worldwide to become part of the Apple community. Therefore, marketing campaigns play a pivotal role in stimulating people's buying habits, providing high-quality products and services and improving the diversionary experience of consumers overall. Ċ In conclusion, whilst the use of adverts should be limited to a certain degree, it confers a valid standpoint as it does wonders for the shopping experience of the general populace. In my final thought, retailers and advertisers should jointly propose a more holistic approach in order to promote appropriate products that meet the authentic needs of buyers."
10330,"Topic: Wearing uniforms is popular in schools, but some people argue that it might cause damage to children's individuality. What is your opinion?","Uniforms are often regarded as an integral part of various educational institutions today. In my opinion, far from eliminating individuality, students can derive huge benefits from wearing uniforms. Ċ To begin with, one obvious advantage that wearing uniforms brings about is the lower rates of bullying problems linked to clothes. There is no doubt that each school consists of a myriad of students from different family backgrounds, of which those from affluent households are able to show off the most stylish outfits. This has led to the fact that less fortunate students feel inferior to others and sometimes they become the victims of bullying due to their ordinary clothes. Thanks to the use of uniforms, bullies are effortlessly tackled and the economic discrepancy between students seems to be no more a thorny issue. Accordingly, uniforms contribute to promoting unity amongst children. Ċ Meanwhile, some children claim that wearing uniforms would limit their individuality and by wearing regular clothes are they entitled to express their personality. However, it is academic knowledge that should be placed emphasis on when it comes to school rather than expression of egoism. In fact, if children are allowed to wear any kinds of clothes, then there is a rise in the competition for becoming the trendiest one in their schools and their academic performance is likely to be sacrificed as a consequence. Briefly, wearing similar clothes enables students to focus on their main targets of going to schools rather than other external factors. Ċ To sum up, I would have to reiterate the importance of school uniforms. On the grounds that they encourage a sense of unity and concentration of school-goers, I believe that wearing them should be maintained as a rule."
10331,"role of museums in today's world Some people think museums should be enjoyable places to attract and entertain young people. Others think the purpose of museums is to educate, not to entertain. Discuss both two views and give your own opinion","In modern world, there has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether the local authorities had better refine the initially educational function of the museums by means of additionally recreational purpose. From my perspective, I think a combination of both preferences will absolutely facilitate the youngsters' enlightenment. Ċ To begin with, museums with tremendous collection of variously historical pieces of arts, culture, science and geology as well preserved and exhibited to general public has played such an importantly everlasting role of reminiscence in historic events to disseminate human civilization and experience towards today generations. Visiting the museums, the young can not only gain educational acknowledgement with historical records but also encourage their patriotism and respect for the liberty and sovereignty the previous generation protected by scrutinizing a wide range of relics and several devastated exhibits in wartime considered as the witness of history. Ċ This may be true to some extent because museums should concentrate on representing their educational aims. However, in regard to the regretful lack of sufficient visits museums are believed to organize additionally entertaining sightseeing so as to either arouse teenagers' attention and curiosity or depict the ancient time authentically and interestingly rather than displaying antiquities boringly. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that a blend of educational and entertaining purpose will improve the indispensable role of museums in current society."
10332,Globalization is positive for economies but its negative sides should not be ignored. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The benefits of globalization are numerous when talking about technology and the economy, however, people ought to give some attention to its drawbacks when talking about cultural habits, and traditions. As far as I am concerned, this is completely true and I will discuss each of the two points of view thoroughly in this essay. Ċ On the one hand, globalization helps companies to infinitely grow in the market. In other words, It allows international firms to open new branches all over the world. Not only that but also, it can help stakeholders to benefit from the different labour prices throughout the world. For instance, a company like Vodafone has branches all over the United Kingdom and Egypt. When Vodafone decides to open a customer service centre, they definitely choose to open it in Egypt even if it will serve UK customers. Because in Egypt the hourly rate of customer service representatives is almost half the hourly rate of the UK employee. Which in turn benefits the company. Ċ On the other hand, social media platforms participated in an immense amount of issues for the new generations. To put it simpler, nowadays most adolescents carry a smartphone and they use it to check TikTok, youtube, Instagram, and Facebook. These websites drive them to see and get exposed to other cultures, and social classes that they should avoid at this age in order not to get depressed. For instance, If a fourteen years old boy saw on social media that it is normal for boys at his age to have a girlfriend, and most of the students around the world do have girlfriends at this age. He will feel lonely and might get depressed. However, If he only deals with his colleagues which are from the same culture and same background in school, this will not happen. Ċ To conclude, despite the financial benefits of globalization, it is clear that it has some drawbacks when used in the wrong way. Hence, it should be monitored carefully especially by parents."
10333,Some people consider price as the most important thing to consider when buying a product such as a cell phone and services like medical treatment. Do you agree or disagree,"Nowadays money is an influential factor in everyone's life. Therefore, some people ponder over the price to be the vital thing to consider while buying a mobile and services like medical care. I would argue that this is not necessarily the case always which will be discussed in detail in the forthcoming paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, there could be a number of reasons to bethink about price before buying a product. Firstly, some individuals prioritize the price of an article to be the most important factor for procuring because of their financial condition. For instance, people who are not monetarily stable can never think of purchasing an iPhone which is the most costly phone in the market. Furthermore, due to globalization, services like health care facilities are available at a higher rate than yesteryears which is becoming unaffordable for the common mob. Hence, they are always worried about the budget for treatment. Ċ On the other hand, numerous individuals may not be concerned about the rates while purchasing. For many, their social position matters because of their status in society. For example, a rich dude might buy an iPhone because of its brand value and the service they provide while not considering the cost of it. Another reason could be that in life-threatening illnesses like kidney failure, a person probably will not reckon about the bill for the treatment but focus on saving his life and never mind paying a little more for the medical care Ċ To conclude, although money plays a part in the decision of buying, it depends on the buyer's mindset what they value more, either goods and services or the rate at which they are offered."
10334,The prevention of health care and illness is more important than treatment and medicine. Government funding should reflcet this. Ċ To what extent do you agree?,"In the past few months, due to the unexpected Coronavirus outbreak, health care systems have been pushed to their limits. As a result, governments all around the world are increasing their funding in order for hospitals to be operational. But, should these funds be used to prevent these situations. I personally feel that, this view would be profitable to an extent for most countries. This write up will attempt to debate the above opinions. Ċ Firstly, by being cautious about your health, by taking extensive test and being closely monitored, you lower your chances of suffering from a deadly disease. While this is not possible for all illnesses, it could probably decrease the percentage of people in the population, that would need extensive care. To illustrate, if most people that have cancer realised it in its first stages, they would maybe avoid chemotherapy, reducing the government’s expenditure on therapies. Lastly, some countries has tried to implement measures for preventing such as the sugar tax in the UK and have seen a positive outcome. Ċ Regarding funds spent on treatments and medicine, secondly, there should be an adequate amount available. The reason being, that while we can prevent some illnesses and find ways to exterminate them, some are impossible to treat. This means that extensive care and medication must be offered for these people to survive. For example, from my own experience, my granddad had a stage 1 lung cancer, but due to his age it could not be stopped, so he had experience therapies for several years, until he passed away. Finally, while being cautious is easy for some individuals, not all of them can comply. Ċ In conclusion, if the governments pointed their funds in preventing there could perhaps be a decrease in illnesses. But, it's my firm belief that, in our society's structure this is impossible to achieve."
10335,"In some societies, it is increasingly common to try to achieve good health and fitness through physically demanding sports, special diets, or preventive medicine conventional or alternative. Some people, however, believe that the best way to stay fit and healthy is simply to lead a normal life. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","With increasing awareness of health, more and more people tend to make extreme changes to improve their health on a daily basis. However, some approve that keeping a normal life is a key to stay healthy, In my opinion, the most important thing for one's health lies in the definition of normal life. Ċ First, a proper attitude for keeping fit should take one's body condition into account. The standard of normal life differs from people to people and should pay attention to it that wether has caused harm to the body. A typical instance is that many people have a sedentary lifestyle and unregulated schedule for bedtime. In this result, although people who with the irregular routine consider that as a normal life, both physical and mental condition are impaired day by day. Ċ Second, with both medical and technological development grow rapidly, it is not a negative manner to modify people's lifestyle slightly by compound with them. In addition, the environment is highly contaminated and polluted after industrial development which increased the potential risks for human to get fital diseases. To prevent people from being ill and unhealthy, taking the preventive measures, such as routine check from hospital, diet plan from nutritionists and exercise guidance from consultants, are necessary. Ċ In conclusion, although staying in a normal life may have merits in some aspects, I still disagree with its ambiguous concept, and I regard people's health would be improved effectively by combining with the high technology which is used properly."
10336,People like working for a company rather than starting their own business. Ċ Why is this the case? Ċ What can be done to encourage people to start their own business?,"Nowadays, instead of venturing into business, people choose to work and stay in corporations. The reasons behind the fear of people in entering business are related to the risks involved and professional background, but there are also solutions that can be done. Ċ 	There are several reasons as to why people do not want to go into entrepreneurship. Firstly, many think that starting a business can be risky. Many people in the past, for instance, invested a huge amount of money in this, but were not able to have enough profit. Staying in a stable company job was the first choice for many, as they can work and save money at the same time. Secondly, professionals who went to school for their chosen jobs want to ensure that they use their education in the proper field of work. Staying in a company would benefit them as they can gain more related experience while earning a decent salary, therefore improving their living conditions and professional growth. Ċ 	However, there are steps that can be taken to encourage the population in starting their own businesses. One way that governments can do is to increase the level of awareness about the process of Entreprenuership. Many are not aware of the steps in partaking this idea which decreases their interest to begin investing. Another step that individuals can take is by starting in small ways, depending on their preference. Artistic people, for example, can sell crafts that they like to do such as paintings or pottery. They can then start selling it to their friends and family, and later on to the local market, enhancing their skills and also their social connection in the society. Ċ 	In conclusion, discouragement of individuals to start businesses are due to some causes, but the ways to improve it are manageable by raising awareness of people and including the interests of the individuals."
10337,Some people believe that pressures of modern life are having negative effect on family life. Do you agree or disagree?,"The modern life has blown a new trend of working and living in big cities. However, some people blame its pressures for negative effects on family life, with which I partly agree. Ċ It is clear for all to see that a number of families have suffered from spiritual burdens it brings. To keep up with the rat race of life, parents are supposed to execute enormous workload to earn for living, which takes up most of their time. Especially, some businessmen who usually leave home early and come back late have no time to see their children, let alone to gather and relax with the family. Besides, heavy stressful workload also leads to depression and exhaustion for cities dwellers and mental and physical deterioration is more likely to happen. Moreover, focusing on their own work makes people desperate and less close, resulting in reduce in family sentiment. Ċ Nonetheless, such drawbacks are not unavoidable. It is possible to find some urban residents that live happily in modern environments of cities. Those persons know exactly how to manage their time budget efficiently and balance between life and work. Some of them are willing to give away a part of work to have more time for taking care of their children, which brings them peace in the noisy life. Equally important, they succeed in taking advantage of modern life, say, information technology and entertainment, to relax themselves and their family. As their regards, stress of modern life is not considerable in compared with the joy it brings. Ċ All in all, modern life has both positive and negative effects on family life. Therefore, people should have reasonable time management to balance the both impacts."
10338,Some student work while studying. This often results in lacking time for education and constantly feeling under pressure. Ċ What do you think are the causes of this? Ċ What solutions can you suggest?,"Pursuing education along with earning has become a trend these days which is negatively impacting the academic achievement and mental well-being of students. In this essay, I will provide the causes of this situation and put forward a few solutions to overcome this challenge. Ċ To commence with, there are two main reasons for pupils to opt for employment: education loans, and obtaining work experience. At present, there are banks that provide loans for the students to support their learning, leading to a mortgage. As a result, individuals are subjected to employment to pay their debt. Graduates, for instance, take capital from the bank in order to pursue their dream of higher education in the United States and start working right after their admission. In addition to this, various organisations are seeking candidates who have experience in the field due to which the pupils are prioritizing to attain corporate exposure before completing their degree. Ċ However, here are a few ways forwards to help individuals who are pursuing their learning together with employment, such as scholarships and flexible hours. Proper research has to be done to identify any scholarships programs before submitting an application to any university. Being aware of such programs might help to increase the chances of obtaining funds to cover the cost of the studies. The government, for example, have introduced several policies to sponsor individuals who are applying for specific countries or courses. Furthermore, most organisations have started providing opportunities for flexible hours, consequently, helping individuals to manage both studies and earn a living without impacting their quality of learning and mental well-being. Ċ In conclusion, after a thorough analysis of the topic, although it might seem challenging to educate themselves and manage a job at the same time, it can be achieved by seeking various ways to cover the expenses fully or partially to avoid debt along with working for firms that provide alternate options."
10339,"In certain countries, unemployment is so high that some have suggested children should stop their education after primary school to learn skills necessary to join the workforce. Do you agree or disagree?","In some countries with high joblessness, there is a common assertion that children's giving priority to learn essential skills to meet the demand of labor market after their elementary level is of paramout importance. However, I personally disagree with this suggestion and this essay will shed the light on justification why I am not in favor of it. Ċ To embark on, it is undisputable that abolishing children's access to upper academic programme leads to the significant shortage of fundamental knowledge and intensive expertise which prevent them from satisfying the speciality of their future job . For example, if you wish to apply for the post as an accountant, you have to cultivate relavant job skills regarding the ability to analyse financial data, the comprehension of Computer Science and the impressive command of English language which are significantly attributed to formal schooling .Additionally thanks to high-level education, you are assured to attain quality qualifications which are considered to be chief determinant that the employers are inclined to assess whether you are qualifed to work or not. Ċ Futhermore, schooling system offers students subjects like sports and music which are regarded as indispensable soft skills . While they may not be directly useful in securing employment, they indirectly make a candidate more employable. Apart from technical expertise, firms currently attach greater attention to credentials such as adaptability, originality and communication skills and to some extent they are ground-breaking elements which makes you superior to other candidates . These attributes are likely to be attained in experiences like playing sports and music. Hence, attending school after primary level is terribly justifiable due to its potential to make people's employability higher and higher. Ċ In conclusion, I firmly believe that stopping children's education after primary school does not improve the uneployment rate , however, it even worsen the situation ."
10340,"Putting criminals into prisons is not an effective way to deal with them. Instead, education and job training should be offered. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","When committing a crime, anyone, no matter who he or she is, should be penalized by legislation and then prisoned for a certain time. This is a widespread phenomenon in most countries for the sake of upholding an ordered society. The policy, however, is not advocated as an efficient method to curb crimes. Ċ One of negative outcomes is that the operation of jails needs to be funded by revenues mainly because it is non-profit organization, while it also causes financial burden or even deficit to some extent. When released, criminals rather revenge society, not in terms of burgling, but more seriously, in murdering and trafficking. What governments should consider is how to combat this situation in root. Ċ It is argued that those who fall into the victims of criminals either sustain domestic violence in their childhood or are lack of formal education in their adolescence. By contrast, when practiced by relevant training, parents prefer to create a harmonious atmosphere in family rather than spark conflicts. Children in this circumstance tend to be more friendly, which lays a sold foundation for them receive moral education and then distinguish between virtues and evils in the middle school, avoiding juvenile delinquency. Ċ Of course, there is no denying the jail is an indispensable department in which justice can be guaranteed and sufferers can acquire certain compensations. To maintain a stable society, capital punishment still exists in many countries. But overall, all of these merely happen behind offenses. Ċ Overall, education and job training are more advisable than direct punishment to prevent offspring from going astray. When sent to prisons, offenders also should receive further education to avert recommitting the same mistakes."
10341,"In the future, we will have more leisure time as machine replace many of our tasks we do at home and at work. Discuss the benefits this will bring and also the problems it will cause.","It is safe to say that robots and other intelligent machines will accompany humans even more in the future, they are thought to carry duties that were historically belonged to us and so we will enjoy more time-off. To my mind, this evolution has its pros and cons which I aim to analyze in this essay. Ċ On the one hand, it is undoubted that people will receive countless benefits when robots take over their usual tasks. With the massive span of free time, people can have many recreational activities that they could not fulfill in the past like travelling for longer periods of time. This tendency is expected to come along with the development in the service industry that accounts for a high percentage in a country' GDP. Additionally, the workforce is facing contentious problems regarding their mental and physical health, once robots and smart machines come under usage, the workers will no longer be worried about those illness which will reduce the burden on the medical system as well. Ċ On the other hand, all the drawbacks can not be contained easily, it has been proven by science that humans only survive by working, while they are working on their jobs, their body parts are also working, that is what keep them healthy and physically controlled. But if our tasks are fully done by robots, we will become lazy and it is extremely negative for our health. People also find happiness in their jobs, which means if they have too much time relaxing, they might end up felling bored rather than satisfied. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that robots replacing humans in daily tasks can be positive and negative at the same time. Humans should try to balance the amount of robot-completed work with self-completed work in order to terminate all the shortcomings."
10342,"Question: Many employers are now offering their employees the option to work from home. As a result, employee will have much flexible working hours in the future. Is this a positive or negative develpoment? work from home - the great innovation","Nowadays employees are provided option to work at home instead of in office. It is believed that employees' working hours will be more flexible in the future. The advantage of working at home that will be discussed in this essay is that, it makes employees more convenient to work at home. The disadvantage, however, is that employees are not able to join face-to-face discussion. Ċ Work at home can bring a lot of convenience to employess because they can accompany their family member while working, especially for those who have to take care of their small children. It can also improve relationship between family members. For instance, parent can prepare breakfast for their children before sending them to school and spend time with them after school. Ċ Hoewever, there is also disadvantage when employees working at home. Sometimes there will be soome urgent meetings that all employees must present and discuss about it. Although the employees who works at home can join the discussion through phone or Skype, it is still problematic in communication when network connection is poor. This may result in missunderstanding and some urgent problem could not be solved immediately. For example, other employees might not hear clearly what the other talking about when there is transmission delay. Ċ Notwithstanding the possible occurence of misunderstanding, in my opinion, it is still good to allow employee to work at home because the relationship between family member are more valuable in compare to the missunderstandiing that might occur during a discussion. Ċ In conclusion, it is clear that an option to work from home can benefits employees, including flexible working hours and also strong bond between family member. For those who have bad network connection at ome should find solution to solve their problem in order to work at home."
10343,Machine translation (MT) is slower and less accurate than human translation and there is no immediate or predictable likelihood of machines taking over this role from humans. Ċ Do you agree or disagree?,"In the modern era, an increase in the number of Machine translations is a major concern across the countries. With each passing day, human spend a lot of time while dealing with translations that really made their lives complicated, there is enough chance for improvement. A huge number of people do react differently because of ample freedom. The present essay will discuss the topic in a broader manner. Ċ Firstly, this profession holds an important business value. Message and translation balance pattern used widely in most countries now. They are a sign of improvement. We must ensure that every media has access to them. For instance, Social media, Newspapers. But undoubtedly, one of the benefits of this is that they are less stressful. Ċ Secondly, there is a rise and fall in quality issues. Accuracy is another area where governments and individuals or private groups can share responsibility. Developing countries are more likely to suffer Machine translation issue at a great level due to multiple languages. However, developed nations have always been ahead in the terms of solution. In fact, they mostly get credit for it. For example, Asian people do spend a lot of time in human adaptation. Ċ In conclusion, even though time changes and people may vary in their opinions. I think only positive efforts can bring more benefits. Computer engineers and citizens to play a vital role to track this subject. There are many ways to get the things done, but one should remember there are hidden issues. Therefore, I agree with the statement and believe that Machine translation is slower and less accurate than human translation and there is no immediate or predictable likelihood of machines taking over this role from humans."
10344,GM food : benefits and drawback Some people think that GM crops are a positive development. Others argue that they are potentially dangerous. Discuss both views and give your own opinion,"With the fast development of technology, GM crops are prevalent in modern-day society. Some people argue that these crops are a significant advancement while others claim that they are associated with potential problems. Both viewpoints will be discussed and critically evaluated before a final conclusion is drawn. Ċ On the upside, there are plausible reasons why people advocate the development of genetic modification. To begin with, it provides the food security for people all over the world. Recently, while many cities are now facing with worldwide problems such as overpopulation and catastrophe, it is essential to cater the sufficient amount of food for the underprivileged who struggle with disastrous effect and impoverished conditions. In addition, transgenic crops can promote food quality and hygiene at desirable attributes m. Since the modernization and industrialization society is developing rapidly, GE food is beneficial from enhancing higher nutrition, productivity and having longer storage time. Therefore, the standard of living considerably improves. Ċ On the downside, there are strong arguments against the use of GM crops. Firstly, they are potentially dangerous for human health. In spite of an abundance of strict testings, scientists can not guarantee the safety of these bio-technological products. People are at long- term of risks which can raise the question of food quality. Furthermore, biotechnology can pose threat to the environment. The use of these crops can reduce the variety of strains which banishes the nutrition in soil. As a result, there is a imbalance in the ecological system which causes catastrophic consequences and other serious problems. Ċ In conclusion, it is true that GE food is a double-edged sword that may enable or hinder development. In my opinion, people should find solutions to maximize the advantages and alleviate the disadvantages."
10345,Some people think that a person improves their intellectual skills more when doing group activities. Ċ To what extent do you agree? Ċ Use specific details and examples to explain your view.,"These days, many believe that studying and playing in a group rather than alone is extremely beneficial for the overall development of an individual. In my opinion, I completely agree with this notion because of its numerous benefits. Ċ Firstly, group games and activities always provide a platform where one can learn from others. This is because, any topic or problem will have arguments and opinions from different people, and this will certainly give everyone a chance to look into the problem from a different point of view, which will further refine their understandings. As sometimes it is not possible for an individual to think each and every perspective of a problem. However, through group studies, one can overcome this. Many studies, for example, have shown that a person who takes part in team activities is certainly a better performer than his counterparts who do not. Therefore, preferring team level studies or games definitely has its own advantages. Ċ Secondly, working in a team is also beneficial in improving mental abilities and thinking capabilities. Since, in a group, all members play as a team, not as an individual, which helps them to think quickly and take action along with some logic to be implemented. These action items will surely aid them to apply different mathematical calculations within a short period of time. For example, in cricket, players have to measure different angles to take any wicket along with the calculation of running speed to take a myriad of runs and all these combinations are not possible in isolation. Hence, I wholeheartedly agree that group-level activities are far more effective in enhancing different abilities of a person than any other game to be played alone. Ċ To conclude, after analyzing all the positives of any group activity or game, I completely agree that young students should always be encouraged to perform in teams because it always helps them in learning and improving their skills."
10346,Some people think that you can never become fluent in a languange unless you have spent time living or working in that country. To what extent do you agree?,"A large proportion of people are desired to speak a foreign language fluently, like a native speaker. In addition, Some people consider it necessary to live in the related country, so that they can achieve it. Obviously, this is possibly a viable solution, but I do not agree this is the inevitable option. Ċ There is no doubt that people living or working in a foreign country are able to have a better understanding of the language because it is environmentally required. Furthermore, they have to communicate with local citizens when they need to consult some problems. For example, they might need to ask the directions when they go somewhere. If they are unwilling to talk with others or even refuse to speak, it is really hard for them to survive in that country. Therefore, to avoid this consequence, they will choose to talk more and master the it gradually. Ċ Despite the potential outcome of the above method, it may not be essential when the learners are determined to study hard and with the help of plenty of useful resources. As we know, it is impossible for everyone to go abroad to learn, to put it in another word, a majority of people can’t afford the expensive fee. However, it is possible to grasp or learn well, even without travelling abroad. For instance, they may meet some foreigns in local areas and try to communicate with them regularly. Another important thing to remember is that there are different kinds of approaches that are provided for every person, such as online courses, specific programs in the smartphones, relevant books and so on. They can easily find a suitable way for them to learn. Ċ In conclusion, If someone takes learning as a normal part of their life, he or she would engage in the practice without living overseas."
10347,Some believe that advances in technology are increasing the gap between rich and poor while others think the opposite is happening. Ċ Dicuss both sides and give your own opinion.,"Nowadays, many believe that technological advancement is interconnecting the world and inequality among the upper class and lower class is declining. Although , in my opinion, the development is dividing society and discrimination has been shown between wealthy and impoverished individuals. This essay will highlight both statements before reaching the conclusion. Ċ First, many discoveries in information technology and the availability of the internet enables wealthier persons to assist financial victims. A tragedy, when posted on social media, grab the attention of people, which results in cooperation and aid for the poor, within a community or outside the nation. For example, by watching a video on Facebook, a textile businessman in my area gave a ten lac cheque to a widow. She had a chance to get the funds with the social platform. It proves that the technological revolution brings poor closure to the rich. In addition, farmer revenues have upsurged by modern technology allowing them to equalise socially and economically with the well-off members of society. Ċ However, I believe that the revolution in technology enables rich students to use advance devices for their study. On the contrary, needy students cannot afford such devices- even they don’t have access to the internet. As a result of inequality, one part of society flourishes, while other is left behind. Undoubtedly, it has seen at the international level also, where the developing counties, like Africa and other Asian countries,lack technological advancement and economic inequality is growing drastically.The reason is that digital marketing is crucial for growing a country economy and it’s unavailability often results in bankruptcy. Ċ To conclude, I have the argument that the advances in technology divide the people locally as well as internationally. Nevertheless, the revolution has many benefits , which cannot be denied."
10348,It has been proven that smoking is bad for one's health. Some people claim that it should be completely banned everywhere. To what extent to you agree or disagree?,"The harmful influence of smoking has recently been established. The comprehensive interdict of smoking everywhere is supported by some people. In my opinion, I totally do agree with this positive decision being able to protect public health. Ċ First of all, though it is true that the number of jobs created by the cigarettes - manufacturing industry is quite remarkable, we should also bear in mind that the negative influence of smoking can contain much more dangerous results. In case of a banned - smoking regulation happening , people who worked in some fields of cigarette industry could lose their occupations, but the value of time or health dilapidation caused by smoking can sustain much more people to have better lives. For instance, many Europe countries do not allow smoking in the public areas and the percentage of people getting diseases related to smoking decreased gradually. Ċ Secondly, while it might be argued that smoking could assist intellectual officers to release stresses, the truth is that each cigarette they smoke cause extremely serious impacts to people around them in a passive way. For example, according to recent studies, passive - smokers could be affected five - times higher than the real smokers therefore their risk of having diseases related to smoking such as lung cancer or pneumonia might be increase. On the other hand, people having problems with stresses can use many other positive methods such as playing sports or yoga to avoid smoking risk for the community. Ċ To conclude, there is no doubt about the danger of smoking and the necessary of a disallow smoking regulation , however I think that it should be considered with some different aspects to reduce unpredictable results to the unemployment trouble of society."
10349,Some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. While others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Recently, every product or good have covered with excess packaging. Whether most of them argue that the plenty of packaging of goods is the responsibility of industries or customers should try to do not buy these products. However, I strongly believe that both industries and customers play leading role in this issue. Ċ Manufactures and supermarkets present their good with a great deal of packaging in order to attract attention of citizens to purchase it. They tend to use none-biodegradable material such as plastic or styrofoam to package their products for preserving the products. In contrary, these materials are inorganic waste which cannot be recycled, and it can cause the environmental issue. Therefore, the industries have to use organic materials which can be recycled and do not pollute the environment for their packaging, like green cardboard. Nevertheless, I argue that the customers also take a part to have the responsibility to reduce the plenty of packaging of products. Ċ The customer should play role to help reducing the amount of packaging. When they go to shopping, they have to bring their own plastic as a final place to put their groceries. As a result, the shopping places do not need to provide another packaging for the customer's purchasing items. Moreover, if the customers purchase the product in small amounts, the people do not need the special packaging from industries, because they can carry their goods with their hand. Ċ To sum up, the industries have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging. Yet, I believe that the customers also have to participate to tackle this issue. Furthermore, the government should take a part to overcome this issue like making regulations for the use of plastic packaging."
10350,Shopping is the favourite free time activity for many young people today. Why do you think this has happened? Should young people be encouraged to do different activities in their free time rather than shopping?,"Admittedly, shopping is now considered as a new favourite pastime most adolescents pay attention to since it gives them pleasantness. There are immense factors why this circumstance happens including the influences of media and celebrities. However, excessive shopping will bring about other problems later so, in my opinion, they should be encouraged to do other beneficial activities. Ċ To begin with the causes, it is no denying that the power of currently various media and eminent people certainly affects teenagers' notions. These days our trend changes almost all the time which is a result of constantly launching new products of a lot of brand names. Moreover, superstars also play an essential role in influencing youngsters. For instance, the more juveniles see numerous advertisements or celebrities wearing a new collection of brand names which will become a trendy fashion, the more there is a tendency they would like to own ones. Ċ Even though shopping may not be harmful if it is at a moderate level, I still believe that adolescents should spend this time participating or doing other useful movements such as playing sports, hanging out with friends, or engaging in public service. These actions are advantageous to teens as they are able to improve new useful skills. For example, when doing civil service, they will gain communication skills, responsibility, and leadership. Ċ To summarize, it is clearly seen that the power of media, as well as prominent people, dominate how teenagers purchase goods. Thus, from my perspective, except for this hobby, they should find other avocations which benefit themselves and the community, like doing exercise and civil service."
10351,"Some people prefer to be self-employed, whereas other like working for companies or institutions. Which is a better approach?Give your opinion?","Many people endeavour to set up their corporation or desire to secure the employment in multinational companies. Some folks prefer to become self-employed, whereas others rather favour having a job. As per my opinion, being an independent owner is far better than working for someone else. Ċ Having a private company is more beneficial because the opportunities for growth are enormous as compared to jobs. If the individual comes up with a million-dollar idea and gets successful in it, then there is a high probability of becoming a billionaire within a few years. For instance, Warren Buffet is a self-made billionaire who became rich by starting an insurance company and doing the trading. Starting an independent firm does ask for extra hard efforts, but the results are fruitful. In addition to this, the owner is responsible for all the company’s decision without anyone interference and can perform all tasks from home in his convenient hours. Ċ Conversely, some people support doing a job because it has less uncertainty in the prospect of future and provide more sense of security. In a workplace, the working hours are fixed, not like an owner who works, day and night. For example, the employee has 9-6 shift every day, as well as receive holidays on the weekend, but for the boss 365 days are working days. Moreover, being employed under someone is a lot less risky as compare to having own enterprise because the chances of failure of the independent business are comparatively high. Although I believe in working for myself instead of working for others and make them richer from my hard work, it has risks, but it rewards for taking it. Ċ In conclusion, being a boss is better than being employed for others. If sufficient efforts are served the chances of having a successful business is higher. Even having a job provides certainty, it will not accommodate sufficient growth opportunities and the growth of individuals become stagnant in the future."
10352,"Some people believe that using animals to test the safety of human medicines is cruel and unwarranted, whereas others feel it is a medical necessity. Ċ Discuss both views and state your own opinion.","Every life is precious and should be treated as such. However, when a new disease appears on the scene, finding the right medication might mean experimenting with animal life as a means for testing. There are arguments for and against this idea of using animals for this purpose with many suggesting that it is unnatural to do so while others concur with it. Personally, I agree with the use of animals as laboratory rats. This essay will discuss both of these views and reflect my opinion. Ċ To begin with, some people feel that the use of animals as a testing medium leaves much to be desired as the following reason will prove. Since every life be it that of an animal or that of a person, should be considered sacred and receive equal treatment. In other words, if no medicine meant for animals can initially be tried on humans before it is used on animals, then the opposite should not happen as they are both considered vital. Take, for instance, swine flu that claimed millions of animal life no human trials were conducted to check the effectiveness of the vaccine before using it on affected animals. Despite that being the case, I still believe disagree with this notion. Ċ On one hand, other individuals believe that animals should still be used for medical trials before being administered to humans due to the following reason. Although both animal and human lives are important, humans should be given priority since their bodies unlike those of animals, do not have certain abilities to fight off illnesses. To put it in perspective, animals have the ability to fight off countless diseases without the aid of medicines and so if they are first tried on, they are less likely to die as opposed to humans. For example, the venom from a snake that can easily kill any human can not do so when introduced in a horse since this animal has the ability to fight off the effects of poison from a snake. For the foregoing reason, I believe animals should be used for this purpose. Ċ In conclusion, in as much as others might argue that using animals is unfair because their lives are just as precious as human's, it goes without saying that human bodies are incapable of fighting off illnesses that animals can. Henceforth, I strongly agree with the sentiment that animals are best used for such."
10353,"Is gaming good for kids? Essay: Many parents complain that computers games have no value to their children's studies. On the contrary, those online games have produced a lot of negative effects on the mental and physical development. What is your opinion?","In the modern digital age, regardless of the widespread popularity among young teenagers, computer games have confronted numerous parents' criticism of seriously detrimental impacts on their kids' development including major problems like cognitive and physical impairments. From my viewpoint, I strongly agree with the advice on limiting children's access to those harmful online games. Ċ Beyond their main purpose for human relaxation and entertainment, the fact that game players incline to suffer from the overexposure to the virtual world of online games has proved their highly hazardous addiction. More particularly, that adolescents spend many straight hours sitting in front of computer screens could spark several health problems like short sightedness or headaches possibly caused by their untold harmful radiation, obesity due to the lack of sufficient exercise and being unsociable because of fewer hours for extracurricular activities. Furthermore, several games with sexual and violent scenes should be banned for those in early childhood. Ċ This may be true to some extent because the entertaining method through computers can be beneficial to the kids' mentality after schooling. However, the misleading way of excessively getting indulged in game missions has resulted in the children's neglect of their school assignments. That they usually fail to meet their exercise deadlines not only damages their study results and face the risk of losing such preciously social relationship like friendship but also leads to unnecessary worries and disappointment of their parents. Moreover, gamers are often possible victims of cyber-bullies when they join in such a virtual world with thousands of anonymous users. Ċ From the above evidences of physiological and psychological damages, I reach the final agreement with the idea that parents having a great concern about their young teenagers' health development had better discourage their children from gaining access to this dangerous software."
10354,Some governments spend a lot of public money training individuals to be successful in international sporting events. Some people believe that this money should be spent on things that will benefit the general public instead. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"Community's funds are being spending by the authorities on individuals to impart some coaching to get success in sports competitions globally. Although this notion is favoured by one part of the society, others have a counter-argument that there are numerous problems are facing by the local inhabitants and the government should solve this issue with this wealth. In my opinion, public funds should be spent on the residents first. This essay will discuss some ideas to support my viewpoint in the upcoming paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, public funds are not only helping to develop the nation but also spread prosperity among people. To elaborate further, with this resource authority can improve roads, bridges, railways and the standard of public transportation. This progress leads to the improvement of local sources and their users. For instance, a recent survey conducted by BBC News has revealed that authority must give priority to develop basic requirements to build a robust society. Moreover, by paying money to any sportsman to take part in sport and attain victory, only can deliver happiness to him/her rather than the whole community. The well-being living lifestyle of common people only can be maintained with the support of raising sufficient funds by the administration. Hence, this finance assists in various ways to solve plenty of issues. Ċ Besides, several other improvements also can be done through public wealth. Firstly, there are major and crucial ameliorate require to achieve in primary necessities such as education and health institutes. Secondly, the government ought to invest more in the public section to increase the number of employments among their citizens. To illustrate, in the UK 30% of jobless got their job after raising the money to public sections. Additionally, after getting success in any international sports it cannot change the future of the local public, It merely depends on how their own authorities are paying attention to them. Thus, social and personal development rely on this fund. Ċ To conclude, I unequivocally believe that the government have the ability to tackle myriad problems with public money which will be profitable for the community and the nation. Therefore, paying public fund to sportsperson is squandered of the valuable resource of the nation."
10355,"In recent times, economic growth has helped many become richer, both in developed and developing countries. However, those in developed countries are not as happy as they were in the past. Ċ Why is this? Ċ What can be learned from this?","In the present day, the economic growth has been soaring compared with the past once that people are accumulating a vast quantity of money. Although they have been worked a lot to save a fortune, some are not still satisfied personally and mentally. This essay will discuss why these individuals are presenting this feeling and what can be learned about this situation. Ċ Nowadays in the fast-paced world, the population is increasingly busy and overwhelmed not only with work pressure but also with personal pressure, both of whom are responsible for this feeling of sadness so present in the lives of people. Even though they already have worked a lot, they strive to go the extra mile and because of this, individuals are becoming ill mentally. For instance, a businessman working in a large and famous company has a good salary and an excellent reputation but at the same time, he is suffering from anxiety and depression. The more worn out workers are, the more unhappy they will be. Ċ Certainly, to tackle this situation, health organizations and companies should encourage a healthy life with a work-life balance. In addition, this actual perspective shows the population how essential is to have an organized schedule with leisure time for family and friends. For example, pieces of international research demonstrate people happier are much more productive and know how to separate time for really necessary functions. From time to time is of paramount importance to recharge energy, to get better results. In other words, having money at the expense of happiness does not worth it. Ċ In conclusion, make money is pivotal to have a good life but at the same, mental health is much more crucial to the welfare of individuals. This essay argued why the affluent population is not happy and what can be learned from this fact."
10356,Companies use different way to increase sales. What different ways do companies use to increase sales? What is the most effective one?,"With the development of global commerce, enterprises, nowadays, are using a variety of methods of boosting their sales, depending on their strategies, budgets, and targeted customers. No matter what sale strategies each company are applying, they are aiming at the similar target, for the increase in revenues. Ċ Corporate's owners can apply numerous increasing - sales strategies after analyzing thoroughly their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. For small and medium companies, their budgets may be limited and have to be allocated economically to lots of departments. In these cases, they tend to choose sales solutions which do not cost too much money. Online companies, for example, opt for marketing campaigns on social networks or third party's platform to boost their sales in lieu of marketing on media, which often charges bunches of money for each advertising minute. For large corporates whose budgets are sufficient for launching long term sales promotions, they will approach targeted customers by diversified methods, such as advertising on televisions, setting up signboards, or co - operating with key opinion leaders. Some luxury and exclusive brands, though possess themselves huge financial resources, choose to not advertise in common ways, but their sales always rise significantly because of their insightful knowledge about customers. Lamborghini, for example, does not spend any money on broadcasting their products on communications and media, yet this brand still become one of the hugest auto producers by virtue of their quality and rare products. Ċ There exists no clear answer for which sales method is the most effective because of the difference amongst companies' aims and their customers' characteristics. If one company targets to become the lead in retail market, discount campaigns will work to some extent. On the other hand, If another company aims to increase sales by exclusive products, it will hardly choose to cut down the prices. Ċ To conclude, enterprises have many options to boosting their earnings. However, which option is the most suitable depends on companies' orientation and resources."
10357,In many countries there has been an increase in social problems involving teenagers in recent years. Many people believe that this is due to modern lifestyles because parents spend more and more time at work and have less time to supervise their children. To what extent do you believe this is true?,"There is no doubt that adolescents are increasingly involved in criminal activities. A vast majority of folks blame their working parents for this unprecedented rise in youth illegal acts as the father and mother does not spare enough time to keep an eye on their children. In my opinion, the whole family unit is responsible for this rising community matter. Ċ Young fellows spend more time on non productive acts than their prime focus- studies They have access to smart phones with web capability. Many teenagers like to chat on social websites which expose them to criminal minded people. It is commonly reported news that teenagers with their online chat partners get involved in crimes just for the sake of adventures. Moreover, with easier access to recreational drugs, these young fellows become addictive to these drugs. They start stealing money first from home and then from others just to be able to buy more drugs. Ċ Parents, on the other hand, work long hours so that they could buy better home and cars. Instead of spending time with their children, they prefer to work two jobs for their next luxurious vacation. They believe it is the sole responsibility of school to teach their kids on traditional as well as moral education. Ċ I believe raising a family is a team effort. There is nothing wrong to work hard to upgrade your living standards but not at the cost of neglecting your children. Parents should allocate enough time to nurture their progeny with love and good guidance. Similarly, children should consider their studies as top priority and avoid bad company of friends."
10358,"As computers translates quickly and accurately, learning of foreign language is a waste of time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, language translation has become easy due to technological advancement, which makes some people believe that learning different languages is not necessary, where I tend to agree partially with this argument. Ċ On one hand, the advancement of the internet has brought various benefits for mankind. One of them is the ability to translate any language with ease. A person would simply rely on a smart device or an application to get the meaning of the word they are looking for. In addition, this allows humans to travel without fear of knowing the dialect of a country. Furthermore, most of the applications provide a great user experience and is available for free. For example, the Google translator application is available on every smartphone and provides a huge library of dialects. Ċ On the other hand, relying heavily on technology might reduce the critical thinking element of a person. Learning a different lingo needs to be looked at as an additional skill, which further helps to build a valuable experience. It will also help to provide job opportunities for someone who knows how to speak in multiple ways. For instance, in my country, there are plenty of job openings for those who can speak Mandarin, which is considered a niche skill. In addition, knowing the dialect of others will help to build good relationships as humans are generally comfortable conversing natively. Furthermore, it helps to strengthen the bond by getting closer to the culture and tradition of various people. Ċ In conclusion, learning foreign languages is definitely beneficial, which needs to be emphasized among every individual and I think we should make proper use of technology to gain more knowledge from it rather than using it as a tool for specific tasks such as translating languages."
10359,Some believe that people today have no interest in maintaining the traditional culture of their country or region. Other believe that it is still important to people that we preserve a traditional way of life. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"In today’s modernised civilisation, while the general public believed that humans are more and more indifferent to preserving the traditional culture of their nation, others claim that traditional lifestyle conservation has been indispensable. Personally speaking, despite both arguments have validity, I would lean towards the latter. Ċ To begin with, it is understandable that maintaining the folklore of a country is not as crucial as before due to an influx of contemporary and novel subcultures from all around the globe. What I mean is there is a plethora of different civilization from diverse regions or nations in a country. For instance, it has Chinese restaurants, European hotels or even Thais markets in Viet Nam. Moreover, the Internet and social media are places in which shared art appear pervasively, which has a considerable impact on humans, especially teenagers. As a result, a lot of Asian countries are partially affected by Europe, and vice-versa. Therefore, having a lack of concern for ethic or fashion maintenance is agreeable and acceptable to people today. Ċ On the other side of the argument, traditional way of life that has been presenting valuably and vitally, should be kept and conserved. Not only does the indigenous art promote a sense of belonging but also makes the younger generation respect their ancestors. For example, traditional Vietnamese New Year, on which people always go back to their home for family reunions and hope for a better forthcoming year, has been preserved. In addition, sustaining belief is considered to be absolutely crucial for all people because it is not only their birthplace’s experience but it is also their soul and heart. Each country has its own people and science which is unique, and protecting them is a way to make people special and different from other foreigners. Ċ From my perspective, despite the fact that people are freely influenced by any different cultures due to a globalized world, it is still indispensable and vital to maintaining our region or nation’s myth which might be partial instead of getting rid all of those. In conclusion, traditional perception, which plays an important role in our soul and daily life, need to be conserved."
10360,Many companies offer their employees the opportunity to work from home. Ċ Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working from home for the company. Ċ And give your own opinion,"The rate at which technological advancements has improved is quite intriguing. Many institutions now offer the opportunity for their staff to work from their residence. While this progress should be applauded, insights into the cons of relinquishing this freedom should be discussed. This essay will give insights into the merits and demerits of working from home. Ċ The world is advancing in technology which has completely made communication much easier. One advantage of working from home is the ability to get more duties done. For instance, the distance one needs to cover to go to the place of assignment could be used to complete an assigned task. In addition, some persons can personally choose to extend their office hours in other to accomplish a milestone which might not have been possible if we were to go to the firm, majorly because of traffic. In fact, operating from home gives an additional time to complete a project. Ċ On the other hand, one possible disadvantage of allowing employees to work from their place of abode is the lack of proper monitoring as many individuals tend to relax and not have their function carried out. For example; currently, because of the prevailing virus, many folks work from their residence, while some persons try to meet up with tasks assigned to them, others may ignore them, even after multiple reminders on emails, therefore, delaying the completion of the job. Also, many staffs are distracted by their kids and other house chores, they eventually get carried away with personal matters, thereby giving little relevance to the job. As a result, many companies lose out on profits. Ċ In conclusion, in the world today, telecommunication is advancing quickly and as such, organizations tend to move with the trend. In my opinion, in as much as we tend to close out on task assigned, the disadvantages of working from their place of abode outweigh the advantages."
10361,"Animals should not be used for the benefits of human being, unless there is evidence that the animals do not suffer in any way  To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Animal testing has become a debatable issue in recent years. While some scientists have stated that testing on animal should not be restricted, I believe that this method should not be overused and other alternatives could be applied. Ċ On the one hand, there are several benefits that animal testing may offer. Firstly, this plays a crucial role in scientific research. Many medical tests on new drugs have been undertaken on animals before human experimentation. This may help in advancing medical and scientific knowledge without costing people's lives. Secondly, in some certain extent, researchers aim to minimize suffer that animals have to experience. Taking cosmetic industry as an example, this testing has been banned as its unjustified uses of animals. Ċ On the other hand, animal testing have many drawbacks that need to be considered. The first drawback is that its inhumane and immoral image. In other words, the lives of animals should be respected because people no ethical rights to use others for their sakes. Another drawback is that many other alternatives, which are non-animal based, should be taken into consideration. For example, some of animals' DNA has been computerized; therefore, scientists could be able to use these data instead of the traditional testing approach while the outcomes might be almost identical. Ċ In conclusion, animal testing should not be banned but its usages need to be minimized. It is suggested that an approval of animal testing should be given by the Animal Ethics and Care committees before the test could be used."
10362,"Nowadays, most people try to achieve a balance between work and other parts of their lives. Unfortunately, not many achieve this balance. What are the problems which prevent them? Suggest some solutions.","The balance between work and other aspects of lives is something that many people recently desire to gain. Moreover, there are issues that tend to stop individuals from actualizing it and the essay below will elaborate on that, as it also highlights on the possible solutions to them. Ċ Firstly, many companies set a very high target for their employees. People strive on not losing their jobs because of a failed goal and so, they are willing to give up on other parts of their lives like the socialization in order to achieve their aim at the workplace. For instance, many bankers are known to miss social events like birthday parties because they are busy trying to make ends meet at work. However, if the employers give the workers less targets, they will be able to create more time to attend to other aspects of life. Ċ In addition, promotions at the office has become a thing of competition. Also, to get promoted, most managers expect the juniors to put in more working hours. This will greatly affect the other sides of living since it will create a less chance for it. A good example is how more people are ready to take up extra time in the production industries just because, they want to appear very committed and thereby getting a promotion. This will deprive them of enough time together with their loved ones. Again, to discourage that, industries should base their promotion on the quality and not the quantity of job that is done by their employees. If this is done, it will reduce the pressure on the people for taking more extra hours. Ċ To conclude, the ability to handle effectively the work and life balance is important. Therefore, most factors hindering its success like the fight for promotion and targets should be better applied in order to increase the chance of a positive outcome."
10363,"Some people believe that governments should pay for health care and education, but there is no agreement about whether it is the government's responsibility. What is your opinion? healthcare and education accountability","Education and health care are two essential aspects of human life. Without proper education and health care system, no nation can develop. It is the government's responsibility to ensure the quality of education and healthcare service to its citizens and I strongly agree with this view. Ċ On the one hand, I believe that education and healthcare service should be funded by the government. To begin with, most of the people fulfil their tax obligation, therefore, they should definitely get some benefits from the government in the form of free medication and education for their children. Moreover, from my perspective, education is an essential factor for the development of a country. By providing free education to the residents, it is hoped that more skilled and educated workers would be created. As a result, these potential workers could boost the country's economic sectors. Ċ On the other hand, I also think that people should also be responsible for their own life. One of the reasons is that free medical service makes some people irresponsible of their health condition. It is believed that expensive health care would force people to follow a strict lifestyle and quit smoking and drinking. Additionally, in my view, private fund for education makes the schooling system more effective as guardians are more conscious of taking care of their children's learning. For instance, many private schools are doing better in developing countries than the state funded schools and parental involvement made the difference. Ċ In conclusion, I support that the government has the responsibility to ensure that those services are available and affordable. However, it is not to say that the government should bear the costs of all health care treatments and educational services that the citizens currently enjoy."
10364,Some people believe that studying online is more effective than studying on campus while others disagree. discuss the advantages and disadvantages of online learning,"There are competing views in society regarding both physical and virtual learning. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of online learning. Ċ First, a virtual study is advantageous for its flexibility but it also permits multi-tasking. Students, as seen in the COVID-19 era, can easily open their devices and attend lectures or tutorials from the comfort of their homes and hostels as long as there is internet service. Furthermore, those that are employed or nursing little babies do not have to suspend their studies but follow classes online. For example, it was reported in a study in the USA that there was a 20 per cent increase in the number of mothers of children less than 3 months old enrolling for a college education because of this flexibility. Ċ On the other hand, however, people from poor backgrounds suffer from the steep expenditure associated with data and those living in peripheral areas cite poor network coverage. Lessons done in virtual spaces require massive investment in laptops, cellphones, Ipads and related service charges that are usually difficult to shoulder. Secondly, not all places are covered well with good internet and this clouds the mentioned benefits. For instance, I have personally struggled to attend serious meetings and presentations in Hong Kong because of the erratic internet-delivered at home; this is despite the fact that I pay a whopping HKD 300 per month for the service. Ċ In summary, therefore, schooling online has its pros and cons such as favouring those employed and being a challenge for the poor. So many other factors apply besides those discussed in the essay above."
10365,"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Write about the following topic: Ċ Some people feel that paparazzi should not follow celebrities and invade their privacy by taking pictures of them everywhere, while others believe this is just the price of fame. Ċ Discuss both sides and give your opinion. Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 254 words.","Each celebrity enjoys a wide recognition from their fans and public. Most often these celebrities' personal lives and privacy are invaded by paparazzi. Some people think it should not be allowed, while others perceive it as a cost of their popularity. In this essay both of these views will be discussed and an opinion will be provided. Ċ On the one hand, public's invasion of celebrity's personal life is unethical due to a few reasons.Which primarily includes, the fundamental right of privacy, where each individual can and should be allowed to exercise their personal life hidden. For instance, as per the civil law, it is illegal to invade in private places unless permitted by the law. Furthermore, celebrities are artists and they are employed for their skills and they should not be disturbed or obstructed during their private time. These artists have their own life and just like any other person they should not be criticised, interviewed or clicked without their permission. For example, recently, Salman Khan, a famous Bollywood actor, was stopped by journalists during midnight to ask when he will be getting married. In short, every human has rights to keep their lives after work as private. Ċ On the other hand, it could be considered fair to invade celebrities' lives because, firstly, their fame and popularity has been given by the fans. Therefore, they are interested in their favourite figure's whereabouts. Very often popular artists willingly give their own interview to keep their fan base engaged. Secondly, popular people have a lot of followers, who assume a right to know about their favourite personality's daily routine. To illustrate, I am an IT engineer, hence I love to read and know more about Bill Gates' habits and hobbies. In other words, being famous has its own price that many pay by way of compromising their privacy to satisfy the curiosity of fans. Ċ In summary, although it is unfair for famous artists to be followed by paparazzi, as it is an invasion of their personal space, it is still inevitable. Most celebrities will always be followed due to it public interest. As a result, I agree with the later belief."
10366,"In the past, lectures were used as a way of teaching large numbers of students, but now with the development of technology for education, many people think there is no justification for attending lectures. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Education is a crucial part of people's lives. For several years, classes have been used to display knowledge to many students. However, thanks to technology improvements, some may believe that there are no reasons for attending lessons. I completely disagree with the statement due to the benefits related to face to face interaction at schools. Ċ Firstly, by attending lectures in an academic environment, many students would secure accurate information. Since some subjects are more difficult than others, several individuals could face specific doubts. For instance, while delivering a lesson in a classroom, lecturers can give immediate feedback. Also, those who do not understand the entire information would have the opportunity to make questions. Otherwise, taking online courses would not allow this significant interaction. As a result, many professionals would make dangerous mistakes. Ċ Secondly, many academic areas such as biological sciences and engineering have practical compounds. Thus, undergraduates should attend universities to have laboratory access. For example, a biology lesson about how to combine chemicals to create products should be taught by a professional in a laboratory, which is the safer and proper environment to develop it. Although technology has allowed the use of online applications to learn, it is not the best option. If a person tries to mix dangerous substances by itself, the result would be extremely dangerous. Ċ To conclude, even though technology advents seem to be a better option than professors lessons, it is not the reality to all areas of knowledge. If students want to be sure about their understanding, they should attend schools."
10367,"Even in today's advanced era, many people believe that bicycles are the best way to commute from one place to another. Ċ How far do you agree or disagree?","In this day and age, technology has made transportation more efficient and convenient. While many individuals argue that bicycles are still the best mode of commuting, others disagree. In my opinion, I strongly concur with the former view, as cycles are the most efficient way of travelling because of its convenience, health benefits and environment-friendly. In this essay, the aforementioned view shall be elaborated further. Ċ Firstly, the pollution levels are rising at an unprecedented rate these days, and it is high time that something should be done about it. Bicycles are the most accessible form of transportation because of its size and weight as it is easier to carry and get through narrow spaces. Secondly, travelling by cycles promote a healthier lifestyle. For instance, it often reported that people nowadays have little or no physical activities in their lives eventually leading to obesity and other health-related issues. As a result, cycling serves as a form of physical activity that keeps an individual fit and active. Ċ Furthermore, another benefit of cycling is that it is ecological-friendly because it does not have any fuel emission or cause traffic congestion. For instance, In Japan, the government has installed special lane and parking facilities to encourage and motivate people to use cycle. Consequently, the traffic, air and noise pollution have plummeted drastically in such regions. Ċ To summarize, had it not been the rise of pollution and health problems, bicycles would not have been considered as the ideal mode of transportation. Therefore, I completely agree with the statement that cycles are the most ideal way for commuting."
10368,In some countries family and friends who care for the elderly do not find time to look after them. What are the reasons and solutions?,"In many parts of the world, most people find problems looking after their elders. There is various reasons behind this and steps are needed to ensure that masses find a way to care about their old family members. Ċ The reasons why some people neglect to look at elderly people. Firstly, nowadays, everyone is busy and has a hectic schedule, they have a job to do that need time due to this they come late from the office, in that case, they do not have time to look after their elderly members. Secondly, children are their first priority to look after. To illustrate, many mothers have twins and few have triplets therefore, newborn babies need more time with their mothers because they need proper time and food. Ċ Although, there are steps to overcome this issue. To begin with, some time masses should take work from home when their elderly parents need them in owning this they both get some quality time with each other. Furthermore, the caretaker is one of the options that are helpful in difficult times. Whereas,Remove the commaapplyIt appears that you have an unnecessary comma after the subordinating conjunction Whereas. Consider removing the comma. Ċ show examples an individual visit to another city or country of their job then they could contact with nurses or caretakers to look after them in their absence For example, in India in a recent survey, the figure of caretakers are increasing for elderly people because their children are lived in other cities and countries for job and proportion is raised up to 20% . In addition to this, they should teach their elders to operate smartphones due to this they can contact at any time and order from the online market when they need something. Ċ To conclude, "" every lock has its key."" However, the young generation should understand this elderly person just want to spend some time with them and it should their responsibility to look after them later age."
10369,Some people think that teaching methodology in the modern classroom should be based on experiential learning while others believe that traditional approach is still the best. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion.,"Although there are many proponents of a traditional approach to education, some now believe that in the modern classroom, the methodology of imparting knowledge should be based on experiential learning. This essay explains that even though I believe that experiential learning is the way forward, traditional techniques are essential in certain cases. Ċ To begin with, experiential learning includes the recreation of real-world simulations of certain concepts or situations in front of students. Firstly, with this, they grasp concepts faster and learn in an innovative way. Moreover, learning is fun with such styles rather than being stuck in a classroom. For example, while teaching gravity and weightlessness, modern classes can use augmented reality (AR) to simulate the scientific concept. This would help the pupils understand the physics behind it in a more convincing manner. Also, enacting scenes out of World War 2 would be a better alternative to retaining the chronology of events than reading it from a textbook. Ċ Even though this might be true, there are certain subjects or instances where the traditional approach of using the chalk and the board yields better results. For instance, it is futile to waste resources to teach a primary school student the letters of the English alphabet using modern practices and the Socratic teaching method works better in these places. That is because these are a few instances where the focus needs to be more on practice rather than experience. Ċ To summarise, though I partially agree with this viewpoint that modern teaching theatres should be based on experiential learning because they offer certain distinct advantages, I still believe that traditional methodology works better at certain places. Thus, in my opinion, modern teaching practices should incorporate both techniques of teaching."
10370,Topic: Some people think that zoos are all cruel and should be shut down. Others however believe that zoos can be useful in protecting wild animals. Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.,"People have differing views with regard to the question of whether or not zoos need to be maintained. While some say that zoos are merciless and should be closed, I personally believe that they would keep animals safe from extinction. This essay will discuss the two viewpoints. Ċ On the one hand, there are two main reasons why zoos are considered immoral places and should be banned. Firstly, zoos are often aimed to entertain people and earn money from them, which means that zoos held animals not because of conserve, but because of making profits. Secondly, from a moral perspective, many zoos limit the freedom of their animal by providing poor-quality environments and facilities. Research has shown that the house of animals in zoos is far smaller than that of them in nature. This prevents animals from doing daily activities the same way as they do in the wild, which is likely to make them feel depressed and develop mental illnesses. Ċ On the other hand, I would argue that zoos play an integral part in preventing animals from extinction. The fact that excessive hunting and poaching have led to numerous animals' disappearance, which is because their body parts are seen as luxury items and status symbols. Take rhinos as an example, they are killed or held in captivity because their horns are highly valued on the black market, pushing this species to the brink of extinction. As a result, Zoos act as shelters to protect them from poachers and these immoral behaviors. Ċ In conclusion, although some people believe that zoos must be prohibited, I am of the opinion that Zoos can help protect wild animals from extinction."
10371,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Ċ Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well. Ċ Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"To begin with, some people believe trying new things and taking risks are not easy tasks, so they differentiate between successful and unsuccessful people. I personally incline toward this thought for two reasons that I will explore in the ensuing essay. Ċ First of all, new things mean a great opportunity to get new information in different fields or the same field. To become a successful person, there is no way to escape knowledge. For instance, when I was a little kid, I remember that my father used to look at different tasks carefully, such as gardening, cooking, marketing, speed reading, making mini-crafts, and many other subjects. For this, he went for different things, but my mother didn't like his opinion as he was not able to make much money through this. Nevertheless, a couple of months later, I discovered that my father had created a training centerChange the spellingcentreThe spelling of center is a non-British variant. For consistency, consider replacing it with the British English spelling. Ċ show examples, where he taught various kinds of stuff to others. After a few days, we found that he really had huge success through his motto. Ċ Secondly, when you take risks, you will give yourself a chance to know a situation in-depth, which will help you generate practical skills. It is not hidden from anyone that becoming an expert in a practical field can give us more opportunities to flourish in an area. My personal experience is a compelling illustration of this. For example, ten years ago, one of my uncles opened his business, and he was quite reluctant to take chances in his trading policy, taking the traditional route. However, he was able to get a survivable profit, but not as a successful one. So, he planned how to make a huge bounty from his business. Later on, he found that he could take a risk by shifting his trade to an online basis. It is worth mentioning that in his area, online marketing didn't take place in its full swing. As a result, he gained new experience and created new strategies, ultimately achieving success. In light of the foregoing, if he didn't take the opportunity and did his work as a general trader, then he would not be able to achieve his goal. Ċ To summarize, doing different tasks and taking chances are needed to reaching your goal because it will enrich your skills and give you practical knowledge."
10372,More and more animal species are becoming extince by human activies in land and sea. What are the reasons and solutions? saving endangered species,"Nowadays, a variety of animals is killed by people so they are standing in danger of extinction. The essay below will analyze some major reasons for this stituation, and measures to tackle this problem will be presented. Ċ One of the main causes of this problem is that people have the demans of using animal's parts for many different purposes such as producing medication, cooking the nutrious meals or manufacturing luxury products, etc. This leads negative effects on wildlife, making them stand in danger of extinction. For example, every year in Japan, a big amount of whales is killed to serve luxury restaurants. Hundreds of elephans or rhinors are hunted and taken ivory or horn to produce jewellery such as rings, or medication. In addition, strong development of sea tourism also makes sea environment become seriously pollute. In particular, visitor who could threw away litter into the sea and oil released from boats carrying them are also the other reasons of the extinction of marine animals. Ċ Some measures are suggested to mitigate the stituation. That is the government should further provide strict punisment to prevent the illegal hunting and trading of animals. In addition, it should have many educational programs to heighten individual's awareness in the protection of animals. For examples, people should be taught about how to protect sea and land environment and animal species living there when they were children. As a result, they can understand about the importance of animal species and have a better awareness to preserve the natural environment. Ċ In conclusion, the risk of the extinction of a variety of animals is current urgent problems so that people needs to have effective measures to protect them."
10373,"Nowadays, people believe that the environment influences their accomplishments. Some people think their success and accomplishment were influenced by the places where they grew up. Do you think the environment does or does not affect people’s accomplishment and how it affects? Please give an example of a famous person to support your statement.","These days, there is an ongoing debate among people that success depends on the environment. Whereas some are in the favour that places place an indispensable role in order to get success, while I do not advocate this given notion and this essay will discuss the reason behind my view point. Ċ On the one hand, there are several reasons why an individual advocates the grew up area for their achievement. In which, guidance and facilities are the major factors can be taken into this account. For instance, Abhishek Bachan, son of Amitab Bachan, is an actor because he was influenced by his father, who is also an actor. Consequently, Areas, where people grow up affects a lot. Ċ On the other side, it is possible to make the opposing case, where the environment does not affect the mankind in order to achieve their goals. First and foremost, internal passion could be the substantial factor. For example, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, who was the 11th president of the India was not inspired by the surrounding but internally he was having passion to do something for the country. As a result, it can be seen that sometimes growing up places does not affect. Ċ To conclude, it is likely to say that sometimes humans are not influenced by their guidance, however, they set their goal and get success with their hard work and passion. I personally strongly support the people, who actually have internal intensity in them to do something different in the society."
10374,It is generally accepted that families are not as close as they use to be. Give some reasons why this change has happened and suggest how families could be brought closer together. Include any relevant examples from your experience.,"It is generally accepted that families are not as close as they use to be. Give some reasons why this change has happened and suggest how families could be brought closer together. Include any relevant examples from your experience. Ċ With the advancement of the technology has certainly revolutionized many sectors. This will lead to the diversity in the social connection with the peer member of the family. The essay will discuss causes for this change and measures that are taken to make stronger bond; are discussed in below paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, the predominant reason for people having less connection with their family members is that they become materialized. Due to that, they are giving more priority to their work as this will provide money to satisfy their needs. As a result, they are spending less time with the family members which create a distance between them. Moreover, people are travelling to foreign countries for their growth. This will become a major factor to destroy the family bonding. For example, in the recent times children will grow in the nuclear family never get the support and love from their grandparents and cousins. Ċ On the other hand, this family separation can be solved by taking precautionary steps by individual and the government. The first measure is that an individual can start to meet their peer one on the regular interval. This will help to create the bonding between them. Furthermore, another measure is that the government should introduce the awareness program which shows the benefits the person will get and provides the shelter. However, having good family relation will deliver the happiness and maintain health. For instance, showing the advertisement on the television create a great impact on the society. Ċ In conclusion, the modernized world is the main reason behind the distance between the family members. This will be removed by taking steps by an individual and the authorities show the benefits of having strong family relationships."
10375,"Nowadays many people believe that children should be taught history in schools, however, others argue that children should learn subjects that are more helpful for modern everyday life. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","These days, there has been a debatable argument about school courses. There are individuals that prefer that offspring be taught history, while other people claim that students should have more modern subjects. This essay discusses both sides of this argument and why I believe that school should always be about history. Ċ There are many reasons why people believe that educators have to replace history with modern courses. The first reason why tutors should go with that replacement is that will have taught students new approaches to life. This is to say, these subjects usually tackle topics that we can relate to. For example, these days, schools have been training their students with soft skills such as time management, critical thinking, and leadership. Moreover, the second reason why this group has this point of view is these topics about everyday life would inspire kids. Not to mention, that these topics will broaden children's horizons. Ċ On the other hand, there is a consensus that prefers kids to be taught history modules. There are several reasons why there is an opponent that wants to substitute everyday prompts with a history-oriented curriculum is due to existential reasons. Furthermore, this consensus believes that life repeats itself; therefore, events will reoccur again. Winston Churchill, for instance, once said: ""People who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it"". Another reason why this group holds this belief is because history modules enrich a student mind. Thus, a student gains knowledge, wisdom, and a plethora of insights. Ċ In conclusion, I believe both sides have merits. On balance, however, it is my opinion that history courses are extremely vital for any learner. This is because I think that these subjects will help someone to not repeat the same mistake someone did in the past."
10376,"People buy good products that work, therefore, advertising is unnecessary and is no more than a form of entertainment. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is often said that advertising is not essential and this is a lesuire for the population in the world. Because these days people prefer to purchase products that work. From my point of view ,I completely disagree with this idea. Ċ Firstly ,one of the main reasons for this argument is the power of different advertisements. For example ,we all know in most cases big brand names are investing all of their annual budgets to sell their products by showing adverts on TV and social media. There is no denying that these investments are answering because apart from these products' quality ,the population commence buying them without any attention. This probably would be for a thing that we habitually call a plan for purchasing all our items by just advertising. Therefore ,this makes it clear why humans can not ignore the power of commercials. Ċ Secondly ,another noticeable reason is the influence of ads on people. For instance ,in most countries around the world communities prefer to have Apple mobile phones rather than other brands. It would seem that most of them did not possess this kind of brand as a mobile phone ,however ,adverts that are related to them are encouraged and persuaded humans to choose this brand of mobile phone. What we should say now ? We can not deny there are many reasons that ads are necessary for 21 century. As a result ,it becomes apparent why people prefer to buy a commodity that they saw in its ads. Ċ To summarise ,I strongly disagree with this idea. I also believe humans do not purchase items that work. It is predicted that to continue common positive beliefs related to advertising this trend will be increased in the near future."
10377,"Nowadays, many people use the Internet to get medical advice instead of going to see a doctor. Why is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?","In this day and age, a number of people prefer to consult with doctors via the internet rather than provide their physical presence in hospitals. I consider that this positive trend has great potential to rase due to the development of modern technologies. Ċ To begin with, It is true that in the Internet age we can barely find any people without gadgets and especially with phones. Furthermore, innovations such as the internet, computer or iPad have changed the way in which people operate in their everyday life; studying, socializing and working. The medical consultations are also affected by this revolution. The seniors like grandparents have direct accessibility to communicate with doctors and nurses without even going out from their home. Therefore, during coronavirus pandemic, a great number of elderly people had an urgent need to come into the contact with hospital staff in order to undertake their health condition. Some of them were in a risk-category of people, who can easily be infected, so it was extremely important that they would be provided with all supplements and instructions from medical staff. Ċ On the other hand, computers also have a tremendous contribution to medical advancement. People, in fact, find the communication through the computers much more convenient as they do not even require to drive to the hospital, waste their time to stand in rows and undergo the appropriate administrative process until the doctor will finally be able to meet them. Moreover, the assignment includes just a few fields to complete namely personal information or identification, and client's health complaints as well. Thus, technologies and recent innovations have a pivotal role to play in people's lives. Ċ To conclude, I believe that medical consultations will be modernized as their necessity will probably increase among the community in the future."
10378,"Illiteracy continues to be a concern for many countries in the world today. What are the causes of illiteracy in the modern world, and what effects does it have on the people concerned and on society as a whole?","Literacy plays a significant role in various aspects of life, and the ever-rising rate of illiteracy has worried the educational systems of many countries. There seem to be two leading causes and some effects that will be discussed in the following. Ċ Perhaps the main cause is the overwhelming cost of education that people who reside in less-affluent countries could not afford. Due to poverty and the increasing inflation rate, families can only provide their basic needs, including food, clothes, and housing in such countries. Their economic condition makes the education of their children a low priority. The ever-present danger of decreased motivation for finishing academic courses seems to be the second well-known cause of illiteracy. Some children, particularly those who live in developed countries, start school; however, they lose their motivation to acquire advanced knowledge and thus abandon study without graduation. This phenomenon could stem from the new advances in video games, social media, and internet-based applications that have distracted children from homework. Ċ The effects of illiteracy could be observed in all aspects of individual life. An illiterate person cannot read, understand even simple signs, and find the correct directions that regularly happen in everyday life. Therefore, these people constantly experience weakness that influences their communication. A noticeable impact of illiteracy would be unemployment or having low-paid careers. In today’s modernized world, people should have at least a bachelor's degree to be hired in order to avoid difficulties. Otherwise, they tend to commit a crime like burgling that threatens community security. The final but the most significant effect of illiteracy would be its irreparable damage to the economic and political conditions of a country because both terms need a highly-educated nation to preserve and progress the country following other developed countries. Ċ In conclusion, poverty and decreased motivation are the leading causes of illiteracy that negatively impact the quality of life of an illiterate person, the number of skilled employees, the economy, and the security of a country."
10379,The most important decision young people have to make is about choosing their career. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and examples.,"The idea that what individual wants to do as a job is not important seems at first glance a fair statement, nevertheless it may make the assumption that there are many other crucial issues about which individuals have to make decisions. As I shall argue there are compelling reasons why choosing what career for young generation may direct their education, place where they will live and information acquired. Ċ To begin with, their major in university is what can be affected by the future occupation. When young adults go to university and study for four years, they acquire directed information and learn skilled craft. Therefore, they try to become prepared for the future careers. Ċ The other root of such a grave idea is that choosing workplace for the rest of their lives, adolescents try to gain much more information of certain workplace. For example, young generation try to know about not only employees who works in specific workplaces, but skills which are needed for these workplaces, as well. Ċ Moreover, if teenagers have clear description about their future jobs, they will choose where to live for earning more money. They may be encouraged immigration to country or city in which their majors have huge high paying job opportunities. Therefore, they can earn the huge amount of money. Young adult like their jobs and live in the high standard of living. Ċ In conclusion, I once again would like to argue that deciding which job may be chosen by young generation helps him/her in other fundamental issues in their lives for example, Choosing their majors, finding the best place to live and gaining requisite skills are affected by which occupation is interested by young people."
10380,many automobile manufacturers created self-driving systems for their vehicles. discuss advantages and disadvantages of releasing cars with these system.,"As the advent of modern technology, there has been a common belief that automakers of smart cars may cause some adverse issues to the society and pose a threat to the old generation for not updating these new high-tech equipment. However, from a personal perspective, I do believe that auto system obviously brings more merits than the bad ones. Ċ There are many compelling reasons why peoples consider automobile manufacturers as a complex system. On the individual level, the old seems it is hard for them to learn how to use these transportations and apparently transforming into this new trend must cost an arm and a leg on a wide scale. In addition, technological advances in self-driving automobiles can reduce the security of their owner's privacy. For instance, to keep track of users destinations, auto system can hold a host of informations which can be served as detrimental purposes if there are any hackers want to use it. Ċ Nevertheless, automobile vehicles will help us reduce remarkably accidents and become one of the most convenient devices according to its self-driving program. The system based on algorithms designed to overcome human errors by working orderly. In fact, a recent survey has shown that about 60 percent of automobile accidents can be prevented by using self-driving systems. This is because they can monitor the paths more carefully, keep a safe distance from other vehicles. Extrinsically, they do not depend on personal emotions and work efficiently without human's cognitive. This can lead to a decrease in human error and accident rate so everyone can drive safely and minimize negative consequences. Ċ To sum up, although community still has some controversial prejudices about applying self-driving system for their transportations, it is evident that using this process will properly increase the life standard of citizens and create a number of advantages."
10381,"In the future it may be necessary for us to live on another planets. For this reason, some people believe that we should spend money now researching planets that could be possible home, such as mars. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The searching for the unknown is human nature. There are many people who consider it is crucial to conduct cosmos studies since one-day mankind may be relocated to another planet for a better prospect so spending for this is justifiable. In my opinion, I firmly think the fund can utilize for the development of the needy. Ċ To begin with, relocating to other planets can be impossible due to its complexity; therefore the fund, which channelises to carry out such research, could be provided to resolve the much pressing sectors. In other words, with the help of the fraction of the spice investment can improve the standard of the underprivileged ones. For instance, India, a developing country, which invests a great chunk of its national income into space excavations; however, this can be better if the authority spends the amount for the betterment of its citizens. Thus, it is clear that how futile the cosmos research. Ċ Another point here is that space exploration is in the rudimentary form, it would require thousands of years experiments are required before moving to another part of the universe. Moreover, the predictability of the studies is unclear . For example, it has been noted that the majority of the initiatives to Mars have been failed some point of the mission . Human activists think that , instead of wasting various resources, the lives of the human need to be assisted. Ċ In conclusion, allocating national income for the exploration of outer space is regarded as a useful act by some. I think it is waste money as the experiments are in the elementary stage and chances for a successful mission accomplishment is slim."
10382,"Which would you choose: a high-paying job with long hours that would give you a little time with family and friends or a lower-paying job with shorter hours that would give you more time with family and friends? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details.","In this modern era, competition is rising rapidly and as a result, people are opting for jobs with long working hours and higher wages to survive. Although working day and night helps them earn money, it leaves them with no leisure time to spend with family and friends. Personally, I feel I will always choose my family before anything else, so, I will opt for low paying job with shorter hours to spend time with my family. Ċ Firstly, more than money mental peace is important to me. If I am not happy with my workplace, and I am stressed out for most of the day, there is no way I can enjoy my salary. Perhaps, I will be spending more on my medical bills due to this. For instance, with busy schedules, I may not get enough time to sleep and exercise which can make me sick. Secondly, with work commitments, I will be missing most of the family events and I will be juggling between both work and social life. What is the point of earning money, if I cannot enjoy any free time with my family? Additionally, in long run, it will only distant me from my people. Ċ On the other hand, with jobs demanding short working hours, it becomes easier to balance life. Like, I can spend evenings with my family and friends; I can go on holiday. Moreover, I can take better care of myself too by doing exercises and other extra-curricular activities. Even though with less money, I feel I will be in a more happy and satisfying space. For example, if I am giving time to my kids, they will value me more and maybe this will make them more aware of what real happiness means. Nowadays, children have become distant from their parents because of their busy schedules. Ċ To conclude, we cannot deny the fact that financial stability is important but ignoring social life because of work can be harmful in long run. It can lead to depression and many other psychological health conditions. A person should try to strike a balance between the two in order to have a happy and fulfilling life."
10383,"Very few school children learn about the value of money and how to look after it, yet this is a critical life skill that should be taught as part of the school curriculum. Do you agree or disagree?","A small number of youngsters are aware of the importance of finances and how to manage them, even though, they are used in every aspect of our society. A commonly held belief is that management should be included as a school subject. In this essay, I am going to elaborate on this topic and show my approval. Ċ To begin with, management is a crucial life skill. The majority of people are taught how to work with technologies and how to solve difficult mathematical equations. However, a truly valuable experience , which money managing undoubtedly is, is out of the curriculum. Thus, in the future, a student won't be able to look after their credits. For example, if a person studies abroad, they will be unable to look after their expenses. Therefore, he will need to take credits, which can become a future burden. Ċ Secondly, a lack of experience in finances is sure to prevent those who wish to continue their education in the business sphere. Since children are not taught business at school, they do not have enough experience in it. This will lead to a variety of disadvantageous circumstances ,such as learning basic concepts at university. As a result, one's education will be immensely intruded and an individual will need to study twice as much, in order to catch up with the curriculum of higher education. Ċ To summarise, I firmly believe that the value of money should be taught at school. By doing this, the government ensures that young adults can deal with everyday financial problems and there won't be prevention in their career path. Consequently, a bigger part of the population will acknowledge the power of money, which will lead to a more peaceful life."
10384,Countries should try to produce all the food for the population and imports as little food as possible. To what extent do you agree or disagree? I DISAGREE WITH THIS TO A LARGE SCALE,"Due to the recent development in food industry worldwide, many people argue that countries should push their domestic food industry and import fewer food products from foreign countries. However, I am not in favour with this idea to a large degree. Ċ It is understandable that not every countries can have the ingredients available to produce particular food for their population due to differences of climate conditions. For instance, farmers in countries with perennially cold weather can encounter great difficulties in cultivating crops and producing food such as rice. This is why the government are reluctant to import rice products from countries where the weather patterns are compatible for agricultural development. As a result, this helps to meet the demand for agricultural products and increase food security. Ċ Nevertheless, there is a belief that food imported from foreign countries is not guaranteed in terms of safety and standards, which I think is not a reason why countries must switch to producing their own food. This situation can be tackled with stricter food quality monitoring. When a food product is delivered from an international source, it is imperative for the government to reassure the quality by examining its current condition. In case this product is considered a violation to safety standards, the authorities can immediately put a ban on commercial distribution, thus preventing dangerous food consumption in the public. Ċ In conclusion, I am not an opponent of encouraging countries to produce their own food and restrict imports, as the different climate conditions make it nearly impractical. Although imported products can cause problems related to consumers' health, it can be solved with stronger law enforcement, such as quality examination."
10385,USING MOBILE PHONES Anybody can use a mobile phone to answer the work and personal calls at any time or 7 days a week. Does this development have more positive or negative effects on both individuals and society?,"In recent years, the population of mobile phones has been making a great deal of public controversy due to its substantial impacts on human lifestyle. Although the idea that mobile phones do more harm than good appears reasonably, they bring more positive effects overall. Ċ There are a number of reasons why the mobile phones are necessary to the individuals in daily life. First, using mobile phones is one of the most efficient and inexpensive ways to communicate with others. Before the appearance of mobile phones, delivering a message from a location to another would require the physical travels, costing unnecessary time, efforts and money. Second, people can use mobile phone as a convenient tool to caught information and news worldwide faster. For example, mobile phone users easily read news on their devices, reducing fee and time for buying a newspaper or magazines. Ċ Another compelling reason for using mobile phones is that they bring a number of advantages to the society. In fact, mobile phones have functions that enable users to keep contact, thereby promoting the social behaviors and strengthening the social connections. For instance, people are more likely to lose important contacts or even forget one another if they do not use cell phones. In addition, since the industry of mobile phones has been creating more jobs and new positions, it plays a significant role in the development of society. In some countries, this industry has an extraordinary innovation and expansion, contributing to a large part of GPD and the income of citizens every year. Ċ In conclusion, the upsides of mobiles phones still outweigh their disadvantages. Everyone should learn to use mobile phones efficiently instead of apperceiving them."
10386,"Throughout history, people have dreamed of living in a perfect society, but they have not agreed on what an ideal society would be like. What do you think is the most important element of a perfect society in the modern world? How can people work towards achieving an ideal society?","Every individual tries to live in a society which is perfect in every aspect, but they are not aware of what a perfect environment is? In my opinion, honesty and a positive attitude among individuals are the key elements of an ideal community. Furthermore, the approach to achieve a perfect society to thrive is to follow the rules set by the government. Ċ The ideal habitat truly depends on the inhabitants, because they must help each other to settle well in a particular community. In addition, they must accept each other values, regardless of their differences, whereas honesty is needed for the prosperity of the general population. The inhabitants must show their loyalty to each other and the country. As an illustration, the locals must not support any international invasion and they must discourage the evil intentions such as betraying their own people. Thus, the motivation to help others and the loyalty among them are the key elements. Ċ Nevertheless, the governing bodies must play their role in setting an ideal community by implementing the strict rules and regulations for people to follow and the people must abide the rules set by the higher authorities. For instance, the government of Pakistan passed a bill in the national assembly which states that no one is allowed to sell or export drugs. Due to this policy which is followed by the masses, Pakistan is considered as a drug free country. Hence, the combined efforts of the higher authorities and individuals can lead to formation of perfect societies. Ċ To sum up, in my view, the intentions to help each other and the loyalty among people are the significant elements of an ideal society. Moreover, the people can work towards achieving such an environment by following rules implemented by the supreme authority."
10387,"In conclusion, contacting an employee may prove fruitful in certain situations, it may have a bearing on employee happiness and health. It could even lead to attrition.","In today’s competitive world, employers want to be able to contact their employees no matter where they are in order to maintain smooth operations. This approach may have many positives, but it does have a few negatives as well. Ċ To start with, it is important to be able to contact an employee especially during difficult times at work in case of an emergency. For example, hospitals need to be able to contact their staff in case of patient emergencies, trauma and calamities. This may help save a life or many lives. In times of troubleshooting certain tasks, a phone call or email may save a presentation, project or win a deal for an organization). Certain organizations, call centres,for instance, need their staff on-call throughout the year. Any failure to do so may lead to loss of business and revenue. Ċ Contacting employees does not always benefit employers. To begin with, no representative likes to be contacted by their employer when they are at home or on holiday. This may invoke a feeling of resentment towards the employer. Some individuals are forced to work round the clock. They even take their work home. This leads to overworking, which may further lead to health risks and other related issues. Moreover, the staff member may feel unhappy at his workplace and may even consider seeking job opportunities elsewhere. No employer benefits from an unhappy workforce as it may affect the growth and success of an organization. Ċ In conclusion, contacting the staff may prove fruitful in certain situations, it may have a bearing on worker happiness and health. It could even lead to attrition."
10388,"Some believe that in many nations, it is necessary to spend a lot of money to build new railway infrastructure for fast trains between cities. Others feel that the government should spend money to improve existing public transportation. Discuss both of these perspectives and give your opinion.","In many countries, the government finance lot of money to construct a high-speed railway in cities. Some argue that that fund should use to maintain the existing transport system.I firmly believe that both of these views have their own benefits. In this essay, I will present some analyses that support my opinion. Ċ Firstly, while flights consume a number of fossil fuels, taking fast trains for long-distance journeys would be more likely to save much energy. The result will protect the environment from the greenhouse effect. In addition, the passengers who use trains for travelling do not need to spend much time waiting and checking in as in airports. Building high-speed trains could not only connect the areas but also save time in transportation which foster economic growth. For instance, in Japan, with a high-speed train system called Shinkansen, office workers can visit customers in other cities within one day period. Ċ Moreover, nations should invest money to improve the existing transportation because the fund for modern trains is an extremely big amount that sometimes needs to be borrowed from other countries such as the ODA fund or a loan from the World Bank Group. That will make one nation increase its debt on other foreign countries. In a recent announcement, in order to build infrastructure and the Metro system, Vietnam's foreign debt is nearly 40% GDP , meaning that it is a 40 million Vietnam dong debt for each citizen. Ċ In conclusion, constructing fast train systems is essential for the country's economic demand. However, it should be considered based on the nation financial status."
10389,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Sometimes it is better to be dishonest. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.,"There is no shortage of opinion that the moral values of the world have decreased over the last few decades. In my opinion, I personally agree that honesty should be followed even in case of trouble situations. I feel this way for two main reasons, which I will explore in the following paragraphs. Ċ First and foremost, honesty creates a complete man. A few years before, in our childhood, it was taught that ‘honesty is the best policy.’ Consequently, this is embedded in the thoughts and activities and the best version of a person is made. A person without honesty feels guilty about the dishonest act he had done and will have to live in disguise. For instance, a study done by a famous psychologist suggests that a serious act of being dishonest, affect a person’s mental status. Eventually, he may become distressed and frustrated. For this reason, honesty is a value that is very crucial in making out the best human being. Ċ Secondly, the social life of a dishonest person is often problematic. In particular, he is often socially isolated and people look at him as an unjust and inhuman person. This, in turn, affects his family life and work life. Furthermore, even if he tries to be honest, society will still think that he is lying. This can be better demonstrated by a personal example. When I was doing myChange the pronounmeIt appears that the pronoun my should not be in the possessive form. Consider changing it. Ċ show examples under graduation, I had a classmate who cooks up irrelevant and unnatural stories to impress people. A lie cannot live indefinitely and the truth behind all these unreal stories was revealed. From then, he is noted as a dishonest liar and all his fellow friends kept a distance from him. He is left isolated in the class as well as in the hostel. Even though he tried to correct himself, the class as a whole did not accept this. So, it is clear to say honesty is important in a society, Ċ In conclusion, honesty is a pillar of a person’s character and should be followed always. This is because honesty creates a perfect man and also being dishonest is a threat to a person’s societal life."
10390,"In the past, important knowledge of culture and history was stored in museum. Nowadays information is freely available on internet, therefore is no longer need for museum. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree ?","With the invention of technology, the popularity of museums is decreasing. Presently, information about the ancient times are readily available online, therefore, some people believe that there is no need to visit the museum anymore. Though it is true that some of the materials in the galleries can be found on various websites, I completely disagree that ancient showrooms are needless. Ċ The availability of different data on the computer today makes some people believe that exhibitions of the olden days way of life is not necessary. This is because it is cheaper to go to the net and gather the necessary knowledge about a period of time or any particular set of people than it is to buy a plane ticket and book a hotel to visit an exhibition that is kilometres away. For example, the annals and the practices of the Yoruba tribe of Nigeria can be studied on google without visiting the ancient town of 'Ile-Ife' where the monuments and old remnants are preserved. Nonetheless, seeing the pictures of past life and culture on the net cannot be compared to when it is seen directly. Ċ However, visiting old collections of a particular place is still crucial and cannot be overemphasized. Going to museums is an avenue for parents and children spend time together as a family, as well as serving as a way of educating the young ones about the cultural heritage and thus preserving it. For instance, parents who accompany their children to the Calabar exhibit in Nigeria often serve as tour guide as they explain every little detail to their kids and thence bond together as a family. In addition, the memory of seeing this ancient archive face to face last longer than viewing it on websites, and also they can be touched and seen from all angles. Ċ In conclusion, even though some people find online information easier to access and less costly, the importance of going to the museums should be encouraged. I agree that the internet cannot replace the several archaeological materials and knowledge that the museum preserves."
10391,Some people think that the best way to improve road safety is to increase the min legal age for driving a car or motorbike.To what extent do you agree/disagree,"A recent study suggests that improving road safety can significantly lower down the accident rates, some people think that increasing the legal age for driving automobiles is the best way to tackle the problem. I completely agree that this is the best way to improve it owing to the security of the drivers and pedestrians. Ċ Firstly, many accidents can be avoided by strictly adhering to speed limits as suggested by authorities. However, many youths are seen flouting these rules and have been directly responsible for any accidents which could have been easily avoided if not for their rash driving. For instance, a 16-year-old with a speeding car crashed into another car resulting in the death of 4 elderly persons. Had he been careful with his speed those people wouldn't have met this terrible fate. Ċ Secondly, youth don't take safety measures seriously as sometimes having just a helmet can be a lifesaver for a motorcyclist. Keeping the head safe from a crash can save the life of the wearer. For example, a 36-year-old who met with a major bike accident on a busy highway has escaped serious injuries because of the helmet. As kids like to be adventurous they neglect devices like a helmet and invite unnecessary troubles. Ċ In conclusion, As drivers in their youth are rash with their driving, increasing the legal age can drastically improve road safety. They become more careful and mature as they age which improves their driving skills resulting in fewer accidents than being recorded annually."
10392,There is an increasing trend around the world of married couples deciding not to have children. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for couples who decide to do this happy family without a child?,"The number of married couples who opt for a child-free lifestyle is becoming a rising trend around the globe. Although the primary advantage of this decision making is that the families' well-being will remain stable, the main drawback of this is that it might result in a lonely life when the years to come. Ċ Maintaining a family's happiness and health appears to be the evident benefit for couples deciding not to have children. Since these couples barely tackle family pressures from being a parent, they can avoid unnecessary arguments deriving from the parent's responsibility and education fees. As a result, not only can child-free parents maintain the quality of the family, but they also are free to pursue their life expectancy. For instance, more than 129 couples asked in a survey in 2010 admitted that they had proactively chosen to be child-free parents to minimize family pressures. Ċ However, being the lonely elderly reflects the main downside of opting for a child-free lifestyle. When married couples decide to live without the appearance of a child, they might confront a lonely life when their spouse passes away. Inevitably, they could live alone by themselves in either their house or in a nursing home where they are taken care of by the government. For instance, Singapore authority has recently allocated more than 30% of the government budget to construct more nursing homes since the number of the elderly is rising over the years. Ċ In conclusion, although being a child-free parent has promoted the benefit of a healthy and happy family, it could negatively affect the couples in the future concerning the lonely aged."
10393,Some people think that to be successful you need to get in university education whereas others say it is not true Discuss both ideas and give your own opinion,"There are varying opinions on success. Some believe that a higher level of education is required. On the other hand, others argue that it is not necessary. I agree with the latter, which says that a degree is not a determinant for wealth. Ċ Some person opiate that for an individual to be rich, he or she has to further their studies and have a profession. They make this claim on the basis that second level training is not adequate, therefore, the need for tertiary learning in order to acquire a fortune. For instance, they believe that studying more and become a doctor ,for example, guarantees the person's comfort. Although I agree that studying to have a profession is absolutely right, I disagree with the view that it makes the person rich. In addition, there are lots of graduates today who has no job and has no money at all for example. Ċ Furthermore, some argue that attaining the highest heights of education is not an important factor to be wealthy. They make this argument with their points based on the fact that there are a lot of influential men today who dropped out of high school. Despite this popular individuals never completing their studies, they are now employers of labour. I support this side of the argument with my reason that skill also could be sufficient. By comparison, these well-known persons have something in common and that is they had a skill they were good at. All they did was to improve what they know how to do best and commercialized it. Thus, generating income, well enough to even employ the brightest of minds who excelled in school. Ċ In conclusion, the essence of formal education cannot be argued, however, it is not determining importance to achieving financial security. Therefore, I reiterate my support for this claim."
10394,"Nowadays, people try to change their life by changing their clothing styles, wearing jewelers, changing their appearances through cosmetic surgery. Why do you think people are doing this and do you agree or disagree this behavior?","In contemporary society, cosmetic surgery has become one of the most pervasive issues, especially among women. They began to focus on external beauty rather than internal beauty, and try to change their life by changing their clothing styles, wearing jewelry and appearances. Some argued that this phenomenon has beneficial impact on people's psychology. Personally, I believe their views have both pros and cons. Ċ Basically, there are some reasons why human begins intent on changing their appearance permanently. First and foremost, the most appealing and seductive exterior can refine a physical trait that feeling complete and confidence, moreover, fashionable dress with superb jewelry can reflect a person's taste and be a pioneer of fashion. Last, presenting a good appearance can change our way to life and encourage people's creativity. Ċ Take movie star as a typical example, great appearance reveals a person's attitude toward the role they are acting. Stars as public figures are desired to present themselves to the utmost in front of the camera. Although an unkempt appearance may not affect their life, but it would have negative influence on their public image. In this case, I agree good appearance could enhance their opportunities in workplace. Ċ However, changing people's life by suffering cosmetic surgery can bring about more cons. It is a drastic measure, unexpected or unsatisfied transformation may cause them to undergo psychological as well as the physical effects. To conclude, people could focus on changing external appearance such as changing their clothing style and wearing, rather than suffering cosmetic surgery."
10395,Eating a balanced diet is the most important factor for a healthy life. Ċ To what extent do you agree?,"It is observed that the consumption of nutritious foodstuff is the most significant aspect to live in good condition. In my opinion, I agree with the statement because it helps to reduce the health problems and protect the environment. Ċ To begin with, consuming a meal with more nutritions will minimise the health issues such as obesity, diabetes, heart attack and so on. That is to say, half of the people in the world are lagging in physical fitness because of sedentary lifestyles and fast food consumption. Therefore, taking the balanced diet will reduce or avoid their illness and aid them to live longer. For example, the lifespan of people in Japan is higher than any other countries in this world because they consume appropriate proportion of eatables to extend their life. Hence, proper diet will improve their health to be active and heal and prevent all the ailments they have in their body. Ċ Another point to consider is that it will help to save the surroundings. In other words, by eliminating animal products will improvise the biodiversity and it will naturally prevent from environment hazardous problems. Also, consuming the vegetables grown in local farm aid to prevent the deforestation. For instance, in India, most of the people prefer to eat organic foods and minimised the intake of meat or other animal products which help them to stay fit and healthy. Thus, people consuming farm grown things and eliminating animal items will prevent the atmosphere for them to live happily. Ċ In conclusion, I wholeheartedly agree that consuming nutrient food is a crucial thing for vigorous survival because it not only lowers the physical problems but also rescue the natural resources."
10396,Does the advent of internet change the role of teacher? To what extent do you agree? the importance of teachers in internet era,"In the tech savvy era, some argue that the existence of technologies like Internet may have altered the role that teachers play. While Internet has definitely its place in the society, teachers should not be marginalized as they still play an important role in supporting their students mentally. Therefore, I partially agree with the statement and so will be pleased to discuss these two reasons in more details. Ċ On the one hand, Internet has allowed individuals to study and learn at home at their convenience which means they no longer have to attend classes to acquire new knowledge. This is not at all surprising, considering that Internet has made any kind of information accessible to the vast majority of people. For example, David, one of my friends, believe it is not necessary for students to communicate face to face with their teachers to learn and understand new concepts and principles. Ċ On the other hand, Internet can never replace teachers entirely in the sense that it cannot motivate and encourage its users to learn. Just like students, teachers are human beings and they are capable of motivating and persuading their pupils to explore and acquire new knowledge. For instance, most of my friends find it arduous to self-study online as although they have access to all the relevant and accurate materials, it is relatively tedious to study on their own; most of them would rather have their teachers explaining new ideas to them instead of looking at the monitor. Ċ Having discussed the importance of both teachers and internet, it can be concluded that teachers still have a place in this society. In other words, the development of Internet has not impacted the role of teachers to a great extent. Consequently, I only agree with this statement to a small extent."
10397,"Some people tend to study a subject on intensive way over a short period of time,while others tend to study a subject constantly or long period of time. What is the better way to of learning ?","Some people hold the opinion that they should study a subject constantly over long period of time. However, more importantly, people who intend to study subject should study in a very intensive way over short period of time for the following reasons. Ċ The first reason that people who study in a very intensive way over short period of time will save the time , thereby increasing the profound the knowledge. To illustrate this, there is very persuasive example. The students who study the English in full time at the English language institute can pass the TOEFL exam faster than the students who study the language constantly in part time in the same institute. Ċ In addition, the studying a subject in very intensive way can be allowed to the people to study more subject compare with the people do not. Now I still remember that my friend Ail who could get two degrees in short time by using the intensive studying in the university. Ċ Further more, The studying a subject constantly over long period of time is somewhat important as well. It can be helped people who can not understand the topis quickly, or need more time to figure out the complex topic. For instance, some student at the math science need three to four year to graduate from the college. Ċ Nonetheless, I still prefer people who study a subject in a very intensive way over the short period of time I am sure that they can save the time and can study more than they do not."
10398,"Some people think that traditional culture can be destroyed by using it as money-making attractions to tourists. However, others believe that it is the only way to save traditions. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","As the development of tourism, more and more traditional culture districts are open to tourists, which has triggered a hot debate Some people think that the traditional culture is destroyed while other claim that the traditional culture could be protected by using it as money making attractions. Personally, I believe moderate opening of traditional culture sites to tourists is an effective way to protect the local culture. Ċ Admittedly, taking the traditional culture sites as money-earning machine would absolutely destroy the traditional culture to some extent. It is obvious that the vicious cycle would happen without reasonable management and controlment along with the arrival of increasing tourists, not only the environment of traditional culture districts would be destroyed, but also dissatisfactions and conflicts would be produced. There are not a few of such cases from the current reports or news. Ċ However, we can not deny the functions and effects of opening them to the public. Most important of all is that it is the most effective to protect the culture itself, only when the culture is known and spread by the common people, will it have a long life span. Besides that, another effect that can be ignored is the economic income; the traditional culture building could be renovated and protected better by using them. Ċ Personally, I think it is wise to more effective way to allow the tradition culture to be open to the public, but what I think is the most important is that the aim of opening it to the public should be spread and protect culture while not to earn money."
10399,"In the past, most people used to travel to their place of work. With increased use of computers, the internet and smart phones, more and more people are starting to work from home.","Over the centuries, a majority of people had left their workplaces apart from their homes. However, today’s popularity of IT devices such as computers, the internet, and smartphones leads more people to work from home. This advancement has benefited from the loss of commute cost and drawbacks from a situation in isolation. And more specifically, its pros and cons are as follows. Ċ On the one hand, individuals can get many choices for spare time and residential areas without commuting. Instead of spending 1hour per day inside transportations, they can afford to learn something new or take care of family members. In addition, urban areas with costly properties are not an option for their home, but the countrysides are also one, due to being free from travel to offices. According to research on employees’ lifestyle in the IT field, approximately 50% of them answered that they started working from home lately and were satisfied with their after-work lives than before. And it showed that many of the respondents moved to dwell abroad like nomads. These are groundbreaking innovations from the way one works to the location one stays. Ċ On the other hand, digital devices can limit authentic communication among colleagues. In other words, internet messengers and meetings require only immediate responses regarding the tasks, whereas face-to-face interactions built up trustful relationships at workplaces. Then workers easily feel lonely and depressed. For this reason, that many companies introduced the work way to provide their employees with mental healthcare services. Ċ In a nutshell, since many companies instituted a work from home policy, many workers have chosen it because it has given them more free time and habitation choices. Nevertheless, it should not be underestimated that individuals can often find themselves gloomy because of a lack of direct connection to peers."
10400,"PARENTS AND CHILDREN RELATIONSHIP TOPIC: In many countries, young people are granted certain privileges and responsibilities at the age of sixteen. Clearly parents have a responsibility to both care for and prepare their children as they approach this important milestone. To what degree should parents intervene in the lives of their 14-15-year-old children?","All citizen of a country are fair in law as they are entitled to do something when they old enough. If they are a child, they will be protected from danger by the government. In my opinion, there are two ways to ensure that the rights of young people are respected. Ċ Through school, mass media, people's rights are widely disseminated. By putting posters along the main roads, moreover, writing books, song and short films about halls of power as the main topic should be encouraged to produce and give free to students. In addition, the online social network is another way to convey the human rights to the young people. This could educate young people about the importance of their rights so that they seek to help to defend themselves. Ċ The government also has a responsibility to protect the young people's rights. Polices should take the interests of young people into account. In certain circumstance, they will appoint a young people's commissioner to sorority new legislation for compliance with the framework such as the Vietnam Convention on the Rights of the Young. This method results in ensuring young people are continuously represented in the hall of power. Ċ All in all, to ensure the youth rights, the whole society must give their hands. It is clear that respecting the youth rights is not just for benefits of the young, but also for highly security of society."
10401,"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Write about the following topic: Ċ Some people think that hosting an international sports event is good for the country, while some people think it is bad. Discuss both views and state your opinion. Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 250 words.","Several individuals believe that bearing international games such as football or tennis has more benefits for society. However, others argue that it brings disadvantages. Personally, I advocate the first view opposing the second one owing to the fact that international sports provide regional visibility. Although it is a financial resources spending. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide evidence from the UN investigation and the University of Oxford to prove the arguments. Ċ On the one hand, arranging worldwide events give the nation visibility. In others words, these ceremonies come with press coverage, becoming the region more visible to stakeholders, entrepreneurs throughout the planet. Let's take South Africa as an example, the UN scientific study in 2011, pointed out that this land becomes 10 times more famous due to the FIFA world cup of 2010 . As a result, it soared tourism attractions and businesses. Moreover, it became the main fountain of revenues for three consecutive years. Ċ On the other hand, partaking in a world sport is a wasteful resource. Because of incalculable financial expenditures used in stadiums construction and mesmerising accommodations these events divert citizens opinions. Furthermore, to provide a secure environment for all people coming overseas, a huge amount of money is needed to be deployed. For instance, scientific research carried out by Oxford University in 2007 after the Germany world cup in 2006 showcased that more than 15% of Germany PIB were utilized in solely one game city, the money enough to build 500 schools and pave 3000 German roads. Hence, the event was regarded as a failure by a plethora of critics. Ċ In conclusion, despite international sports being considered as taxes spending, it has undoubtedly more benefits than drawbacks. Therefore, I recommend the local ruling power organize these types of events in their lands for sake of economic growth and national visibility."
10402,"Some people believe that the responsibility for the protection of the environment is by a transnational organization, rather than by each individual country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is certainly true that few individuals think that the onus of protecting the environment lies with an international organization and not on each state separately. I do not concur with this school of thought and in the essay, I will provide my point of view with examples.  Ċ To begin with, those who advocate that it is the duty of an international organization to protect the ecosystem may argue that this mechanism will work even for nations who do not have any funds to support it. For example, a poor nation like Kenya who does not have enough money to feed its own people, will not be able to spend anything on saving the natural habitats and let it die on its own. Here the united-body will be able to assist since it will have bucks pooled up from rich countries as well. Moreover, this body will also be able to oversee and help in cases where two countries are in a conflict to work together for a bigger cause. Hence, the transnational institution is the need of the hour.  Ċ On the other hand, in my opinion, it is better if every country is free to safeguard its environment on its own since it will be the best judge of the magnitude of the problem faced. For instance, Australia is the best to understand the gravity of the issue of the coral reef. It will hardly be understood properly by a landlocked nation. Additionally, if in case a global institution is given the duty to preserve the biosphere, it will lead to many conflicts over the sharing of funds. Every state will ask for equal distribution and non-lobbying states will be left out. Alternatively, if a province fails to protect its natural resources, united-nations can plan to put restrictions on it. Ċ In conclusion, despite the benefits of funds being available to poor nations and united body helping two countries at conflict to work together in case of a worldwide institution fulfilling the duty, I believe that every country is the best judge to understand its natural habitat and its associated problems and a global body can have conflicts for the distribution of funds. Hence, a system of an individual nation managing its ecosystem is more just, and justice in my view is paramount."
10403,"All young people should be encouraged to try new sports, including extreme sports Extreme Sports - Do You Dare?","Sport is very important, because thanks to sports people are healthy and active. Extreme sport is also necessary, because it gives new experience. Often young people don't know what is an extreme sport and why it is important or dangerous. Ċ On the one hand, I agree, that young people should to do sport, and try new experiences, Every new activity is experiencing. However, these are playing football, dancing or doing extreme sport. All new look as try extreme sport is interesting and of course new experience. Example, when young people do Benji jump, she/ he know that it is good or bad for them. And if she/he likes it, then can do it more and more. All new experiences are good, because people learn herself/ himself. Ċ On the other hand, I disagree that young people should try extreme sports. It is everyone's personal choice, if she/he want to try it or not. As well extreme sport is dangerous and there are a lot of accidents, when people do extreme sport. When encourage people to do extreme sport and show videos and pictures about this, then young people think only that is fun. and do not think that is dangerous also. Ċ In conclusion, I think that sport is very important and all young people should to sport. But this decision if to do extreme sport or not is everyone's personal choice. Of course, should talk about extreme sport, then young people know, which sports, there are, but also take the consequences, when do extreme sport."
10404,"Nowadays, food travels thousands of miles from the farm to the consumer. Is it a positive or a negative development?","Nowadays, as the modern civilization takes place, a model of supplying directly from the farm to supermarkets in the cities has formed. To my view, despite the benefits it offers to people, it is still largely a negative development. Ċ It is true that there are many advantages brought to city people by this development. People are presented with more diversified choices constituted by food from all over the world. Take cherries as an example, people do not have to travel thousands of miles to enjoy those in the farm. Thus the benefit of convenience can be enjoyed. Also, as the environment in metropolitans is greatly polluted, people, by doing so, are still able to enjoy pollution-free vegetables. This prevents pollution to exert further effects into people's diet. Ċ However, there are tradeoffs to these benefits. First, with thousands of miles of travelling, fruits and vegetables can hardly be kept fresh without chemical additives which could cause serious harm to human body. Even worse, in order to prevent vegetables from corruption, some farmers crop them days before maturation, causing a large proportion of nutrition to be lost. Ċ Second, increased use of transportation means could worsen the existing environmental problems. More specifically, fuel that cars and airplanes use contributes greatly towards Global Warming by releasing carbon dioxide into the air every time it is burned. Eventually, in the long-term, there would be no pollution free site even in the countryside. Ċ To conclude, although supplying food directly from farm exerts some obvious benefits especially to city people, these benefits, in the long term, does not seem to justify its costs and threats it brings."
10405,Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.,"People attend University for many reasons. For example, new experience, to increase knowledge, career preparation and etc. Ċ First of all, when students present at lecture or class they can get more knowledge. To be more precisely, the lecture which is instructed by professor is valuable. For instance, when I took ""peoples of Africa"" class our professor shared with his experience and it was so interesting and motivated a lot of students to learn more about this region. Albeit, our professor gave us a chance to go to fill trips I am sure which a life-long memory. Ċ Second of all, compulsory classes allow students to develop their social and communication skills. For example, studying in a team-work will help students to cooperate with the other students. Also, it gives opportunity to learn how to listen and respect others opinion .Furthermore, it would be a good chance to prepare students to their future career. Ċ Last but not least, another reason that classes should be mandatory is to experience both motivation and competition source. While being required to attend classes you would be able to work with other students and for sure there will be competition among them. As result, it will lead to success and achievement of goals. Ċ To sum up, having three reasons which are valuable knowledge, career preparation and rich experience allows me believe that attendance must be compulsory."
10406,The worldwide population of children aged 15 and younger is rising. What are the current and future advantages and disadvantages for countries with this kind of growth?,"In recent years it is noticed that the population of children has increased all over the world. Therefore, countries take benefit from this change. However, this change has some dark side which effects after a few decades. Ċ On the one hand, there are a lot of o advantages to the younger generation. The youngsters are always a part of the country’s economy and they play a vital role in their incline by their contributions. For example, 65 per cent of Pakistan's population are young people where age are not more than 25 years that's why in a few years Pakistan's economy grow continuously. In addition, the adults have accepted changes very quickly because they are on their learning faces. Thus, nowadays, children interested in science and technology subjects rather than art subjects. Ċ On the other hand, those countries face more problems after a few years where the whole generation getting old at the same time. The authorities will have to spend money on their look after. For instance, according to the report of the BBC. The Thailand major population are base on elder citizens where minimum age is 40 years, therefore the 20 per cent of their budget they have spent on those people and give other facilities. Moreover, at the same time, a generation retires from their jobs. Therefore, countries also face economic crises. Ċ To summarize, young adults creates a lot of thing for this world and contribute to their country's economic development. Whereas, when they turn into old citizens of the country than the authorities should be able to help them and that is a big problem for the governments."
10407,"Exposure to international media, e.g. films, TV and magazines, has an impact on the local culture. Please discuss whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.","Today, the local cultures compete strongly with the emergence of foreign cultures through the media. I believe this development triggers an impact on the existence of local culture. Nevertheless, I will discuss this issue further in this essay. Ċ Media is one of the facilities that publish any information around the world which is accessible for people all ages. Furthermore, media can enrich people's insights through magazine or newspaper they read or TV program they watch. Take for instance a healthy American life style article, it is the way of media to foster the readers in order to adjust their life style. Thus, the local people possess a good life long expectancy. Ċ However, there is evidence that not all media presents beneficial programs or articles particularly for youngsters and children. For example in terms of entertainment, such as girl bands or boy bands and drama films published in TV programs. Generally speaking, these shows influence the student's performance in the school because many students have been addicted to watch them. Nowadays, the emergence of foreign culture presented through media such as apparel style disposes people to ignore domestic products. As a consequence, the local culture will erase by the time if the societies do not aware of it. Ċ To sum up, it is true that media has allowed people to see other cultures that can inspire them. However, this phenomenon has threatened the prevailing local culture wherein as a distinction of a country. Therefore, the government should take into account this issue for preventing the eradication of local culture."
10408,"Some parents allow their teenage children to live independently, away from home. Other parents don’t want their teenage children to live away from them. Which do you think is better and why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.","Currently, when children grew up, they have choice living away from parents' house or living together. Some parents think than it is useful for their future living separately while another part think differently. I totally sure that teenagers should live away from the their homes, and I will explain why. Ċ As you know, living the separately has many benefits. Firstly, if people live far away from their parents it can help being independent. Sometimes, they should make a decision in different situation. Moreover, this time parents cannot help them. Of course, children may make several mistakes. Consequently, if they go through this situation, it is can develop their mind to the good way. For instance, after school some students should choose when they continue their education. As a result, they have to decide which one is the best for them. Ċ Secondly, living far away from home can teach us the invaluable lesson of living in harmony with other people. We learn to live with many roommates, and sometimes, bear with their bad habits. We learn to tolerate, as well as respect others. Apparently, it is like we are living in a small society, and this will help us a lot in getting along with people later in our career. For example, students who live in the university’s campus noticeably different from the students who live with parents. Ċ To conclude, from the above arguments, live from the parents can change their live very strong. It is a very good choice for the mind developing and being independent."
10409,"Some people believe that the government should support the funds for the arts, while some other people suggest that money should be used for public health and education. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","A particular issue about social funds has raised quite a concern at home and abroad. Some individuals consider that governments should spend more money on public health and education while others believe it is more useful to support the funds for arts. In my opinion, it is necessary to look at the inherent details on both sides and leads to a plausible conclusion. Ċ On one hand, unlike science that focuses on and emphasizes figures, art offers people more faith and optimism that could turn the tide of the dark side of humanity. Modern people have nowadays accumulated pressure throughout their daily work time. However, art provides opportunities to deal with the suffering that needs to be addressed. For example, whenever people feel moody, they might seek shelter in music and drawing- either by singing, performing, or painting, through these art activities, which may help humans alleviate their stress. Moreover, it escalates not only people's mental situation but also generates more energy for the society and leads to a positive influence on human-beings. Ċ On the other hand, those individuals who focus on spending funds on public health and educational systems consider a more practical aspect of society. For one thing, public welfare provides people's basic living needs. Therefore, the more governments focus on the public welfare system, the more likely will it influence the substantial aspect of citizens' life. For instance, governments should allocate some budgets for instituting educational sectors, public transportations, and public facilities. With these policies that emphasize more on materialistic aspects of life, the more possibilities will give rise to an elevation of public living standards. Hence, leading to a profound impact on the community. Ċ To put in a nutshell. I consider that both art and public welfare are inseparably interconnected. That is to say, art and public welfare effect on either the mental and physical sides of humans. Thus, it is an essential issue for modern society to learn to tip a balance between art and public health, ranging from encouraging people to appreciate the beauty of art to instituting more public facilities."
10410,Cyclists and car drivers sharing the same roads causes some problems. What are the problems and what can be done to reduce them?,"Contemporarily, in several countries, bicycle and car users have a tendency to travel on the same tracks. There are galore problems caused by this propensity as well as some achievable contrivances for authorities and roadsters to diminish those route issues. Ċ In general, cyclists and car drivers using the same roadways certainly leads to two main points. Firstly, the more various vehicles on one thoroughfare are, the higher the mortality rate is. To be more specific, when there is a variety of transportations, it is a threat for bikers to be crashed by four-wheel means. For example, in Vietnamese national highway 1A, the average mortality rate is 10 victims per year, which most are caused by motorcycles crushed by cars. Moreover, not only does the mortality rate increase but also the velocity of cycles is likely to hinder steersmen. For instance, helmsmen have to wait for people who ride their bikes to pass through the way that sometimes makes them late for an appointment. Ċ However, to deal with those problems, some procedures should be taken into consideration. To tackle the great number of road accidents, the governments should consider limiting the maximum speed of automobiles. To illustrate, if they commute slower, they will have more time to be aware of the existence of people who ride bikes in their surroundings so as to keep a safe distance between them. Furthermore, we probably deal with the inconvenience that automobile controllers have to face by separating automobile laneways and bicycle routes. Thus, commuters can go on their own since they do not have to wait for other transportations. Ċ In conclusion, sharing the same artery by cyclists and chauffeurs may bring some encumbrances that travellers deem not to expect them. Nonetheless, we absolutely deal with those drawbacks by using lots of obtainable methods."
10411,“ Many people think that men should go out to work while women’s place is in the home. To what extent do you agree or disagree?”,"Gender roles have always been the topic of heated dispute. It is believed by many that women should play a more active role in society, while others oppose this idea, and advocate the traditional mindset that obliges men to work outside and women to remain as housewives. I strongly support the latter view for the following reasons. Ċ First and foremost, promoting gender equality benefits both society and individuals alike. Women and men may have different biological attributes, but suppressing either gender with social pressure does not help them flourish. For instance, female political leaders such as Angela Merkel are among the most powerful and progressive leaders globally. If these strong women were forced to stay at home to do house chores, the world would be deprived of such iconic characters. Therefore, these popular gender norms do not apply to today's world, and we need to rethink them. Ċ Moreover, some men may be better at staying at home instead of working outside. In other words, the opposite is also true about gender roles. To illustrate, in many developed countries, it is now common for wives to work regular jobs, while their husbands take care of children and other domestic errands. These men report being extremely satisfied with their situation. Hence, not all men are built to work under stress for long hours and prefer to have a more subtle lifestyle doing tasks that require more patience. Ċ In conclusion, regarding the issue of male and female roles in society, I hold the opinion that the dynamics are changing around the world. Thus, we should accept the transformation of previously common notions. Although both genders may hold certain inherent abilities that differ from one another, each individual ought to be able to determine his or her own destiny."
10412,"Some educationalists argue that non-exam, art-based subjects, such as music, drama, art and craft, should be compulsory in the secondary-school curriculum. They believe that activities such as these can improve overall academic performance.  To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays many educationalists come with their new research on art influence in student academic improvement. Some say the compulsory subjects should not only depend on science and language but also arts might hold in these considerations to improve student academic performance. While it is true, I tend to argue there more likely to consider the reserve. Ċ Obviously, school has been ruled to represent in compulsory subjects; language and science, and it is main subjects which should be taken examination in secondary school. However, there are some additional curriculum which are used to stimulate student activity such art, music, drama and craft. Ċ Generally, language and science have a longer schedule than additional subjects, but most of students are prefer to do subjects that they are good at. Moreover, researchers believe that additional skill could encourage student interesting to improve their academic performance. Ċ It is true that commonly, students are pleasure to do art or drama for a long time in school, because that subject might be their hobby or talent. Doing art or drama will attract their attention because they can play it together with other friends, and they could do experiment on their hobbies. But to do these subjects, school should prepare more time, and it means student will not focus on their main subject. Ċ Accordingly, educationalists think that making additional subject to be compulsory subject is a must. I think it could be possible because improving talent in someone life could bring much exercise in their talent and it is better than only knowing a general knowledge."
10413,"Topic : Many people support the development of agriculture, such as actory farming and creation of new fruits and vegetables. Others oppose to the idea. Present both sides and give your opinion .","The investment of agriculture has become a wide dicussed topic in our society recently. Some people believe that agriculture should be taken as a main energy part of life while others think technologies should be encouraged instead. In this essay, I will elaborate on this controversial phenomenon. Ċ All people know that health and decease always have an important impact on agriculture process. Goverment recently take care so much about the quality of agriculture product such as food anf vegetables because people can not live without these. Moreover, buisiness related agriculture reaches to improve the economic in a country. It motivates the labor market and to reduce the unemployment happening in modern life. For example, some poor countrien where many farmers are the most living uses more than 75% for developing fields instead of growing advanced technolgies. Ċ However, there are some other people who conclude that putting a lot money to agriculture is waste. It is essential to study and to find out many new facilities in order to adapt people's interest. Furthermore , the deficit of national budget in some poor countries where agriculture activities are developing appear clearly. The productivity is ineffecient. For instance, some products such as coconuts and annatto seeds have to be grown over ten years before harvesting. Ċ In conclusion, some people are very convenient and happy with support agriculture while others are incovenient. In my view, I hope that agricultural activities always be one of crucial role the thrive their own countries."
10414,"Psychological illnesses may not be as obvious as physical disabilities or illnesses, nevertheless they are just as disabling in their own way. Society, however, is more accepting of those with physical than psychological illnesses or disabilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is true that mental illness being is not as visible as physical sickness, in spite of this, they affect badly in their own way. Nonetheless, the society seems to accept more of those with body than mental diseases. For some reasons, I believe that mental disabilities should be taken seriously. Ċ On the one hand, it is understandable why physical issues are more priority than mental illnesses. The main reason of this is that people who suffer from physical disabilities can see all the problems that relate to their body. As a result, they would most likely go to the doctors and then issues can be treated and diagnosed easily. In addition, it is a mindset of society that when considering to illnesses, people often think of physical issues. Ċ On the other hand, I think that people who suffer from mental illnesses are at risk as those of physical sickness. Statistics show that the number of people who have psychological disorders are the same as those have physical problems. In fact, the number of this is much higher because the data do not show the amount of people who keep silent about their diseases and do not go to the doctors. Moreover, it is difficult to treat the psychological illnesses. This is because the symptoms of these diseases are vague for any particular issues. They take a long time to be treatable for example years of therapy and medicines, sometimes these diseases even come back. Therefore, they could put a strain on people’s budget because of years of treatment. Also, the society is lack of the number of hospitals and doctors who have profession about the psychological issues. Ċ In conclusion, even though mental disorders are not obvious as physical diseases, they are harmful to human health in the their ways and there should be more priorities for these kind of diseases."
10415,"healthy lifestyle - IELTS writing task 2 some people say that the government should ensure that people lead a healthy life, while others believe individuals should have their own choices. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The healthy lifestyle is important because it has a direct bearing on our dignity and well-being. Some people believe governments' regulations are needed to lead a healthy life, while others think it is a personal choice. From a personal view, I do not believe people will actively engage in it unless governments take some actions. Ċ On the one hand, the authorities' requirements can increase the number of people who have a healthy lifestyle. In this case, governments are likely to conduct a series of restrictions on goods which have adverse impacts on people's health, such as imposing high taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. Some punishments may also be taken to prevent people from not doing exercise. As a result, an increasing number of people will join activities which can improve their health. Ċ On the other hand, people should have rights to choose what kind of life they want to have because they can be happy in this way. People who have always been enjoying healthy fruits and vegetables will keep doing so. However, if governments put compulsory regulations on these people's life, they will suffer from massive pressure and may no longer enjoy the lifestyle that they used to have. Ċ In my opinion, it is more important for governments to guide people about how to lead a healthy life. Many people may not aware of the dangers of bad living habits they are having at the moment. For example, office workers will do more outdoor activities if governments advertise a concept that sitting for a long time will reduce people's lifespan. Ċ In conclusion, people can benefit the most from governments' advice on how to have a healthy life."
10416,"Some people think that schools should stop teaching students by using books, because students find them boring and that children can learn from films, TV, video games and computer instead. To what extent do you agree?","School is a platform that enlightens the path of a child in a prudent and pragmatic way. Due to rapid modernisation and digitalisation in the last decade, certain researchers have now vehemently suggested that educational institutes should stop inculcating bookish knowledge in a student and teach them through various digital platforms. I am in partial agreement with a given statement as both play a vital role in the overall development of the child. In a subsequent ,paragraph I intend to shed light on the given topic with proper illustration and an appropriate conclusion. Ċ Analysing the statement and explaining further, the first and foremost reason is that periodicals are cost-effective and their shelf life is more as compared to films or computer games. Secondly, books cause fewer ill effects on the eyes as compared to digital screens. To vindicate, recent research by WHO has proved that children who use mobile phones at an early age are more prone to have stress and strain on their eyes, as the chance of them wearing spectacles are on the higher side. Ċ On the other hand, there is an exponential rise in audio-video learning as it helps in developing cognitive and analytical skills in a child. Moreover, infants find it more attractive and creative as it uses various visual effects in teaching. To exemplify, BYJU's online platform to teach various lessons uses 3D models and diagrams to explain various theories. Furthermore, they are more entertaining as compared to written publications. Ċ To conclude, one cannot ignore the benefits of both methods in modern schooling structure. Therefore, a proper balance between the two should be maintained."
10417,The dangers and complexities of the modern world have made the mobile phone an absolute necessity for children. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The threats and complexities to the children of the modern world have made the mobile phone an absolute necessity for them. I completely agree with this statement and this essay will explain further on the same. Ċ To begin with, children are not fully aware of the real dangers that exist in the current world. Their innocent nature can make them potential victims to grave scenarios like robbery and kidnap. In such cases, a mobile phone can be of immense help in ensuring that those youngsters are safe at all times. For example, A third-grade student was recently abducted by a group of men while he was returning from school last week. Although the chance to successfully trace him in such a situation was very low, the police were able to track him using the location tracker feature of his mobile phone and save him as well.Thus, smartphones can be a great benefit to children while facing dangerous situations. Ċ Additionally, children can become demotivated due to various circumstances in life. In such situations, if a child is away from his immediate family but still wants to talk with them privately, then mobiles can be of great help. For instance, last year, my 5-year-old niece suddenly felt emotionally alone while she was travelling on a bus. So she called her mother using her mobile to share her thoughts and she felt comfortable after that.Therefore, mobiles can help children reach to their close friends and family from any place for emotional support. Ċ To conclude, in addition to the examples and reasons provided, I would like to reiterate that children should compulsorily have mobiles to ensure that they are safe physically and emotionally at all times."
10418,"Some people believe that governments should spend the money from taxes on healthcare services, while others think that this budget should be invested in other fields. Ċ Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.","There has always been an argument on how the tax fund is mismanaged by the central government. Some suggest it should be invested in better healthcare infrastructure, while others propose it should be utilized for other fields like sports, education, housing and many more. In my opinion, I do not agree with money getting spent only on healthcare. However, both sides of this argument will be discussed in this essay before drawing a reasoned conclusion. Ċ To start with, The sole responsibility of a good functioning government is to properly distribute the allocated funds among the various department of the administration. For instance, the finance minister is one of the most important positions within the cabinet, their role is to manage the public fund effectively and allocate it to required sectors. Thus the people of a country are assured that their tax money has been properly dispursed for the welfare of the public. Ċ On the contrary, If the administration decides to focus only on public healthcare and infuse a major portion of the money from the nation's budget into it. This will help in creating better hospitals and state of art medical facilities, which would directly increase the life expectancy of people. For example, The Indian government has increased the healthcare budget from 3% to 6% from the upcoming financial year , this has indirectly helped authorities to establish public hospitals in an interior region of India. Moreover, this proves that villagers who had to travel towards urban cities for better treatment can now get diagnosed in their own village. Ċ To summarise, a good administration has to consider the various aspects of people's requirements. After thorough analysis on this subject, it is predicted that all the fields should be evaluated and the money has to be distributed based on the necessity."
10419,Some people believe that professional athletes should be free to use performance enhancing substances if they wish. Do you agree?,"Over the past two decades, performance-enhancing substances, have become more and more widespread. Profound professional athletes have been caught using them, in order to overtake their competitors. But, should athletes have the choice of taking or not these substances? In my opinion they should not and in this essay I will discuss why. Ċ Firstly, every athlete has the right to choose what he does with his body. In a free society, nobody has the authority over the substances he takes. Although, when competing at high levels, he must follow the rules. Moreover, they give the athlete the ability to achieve astonishing records. To illustrate, the university of Cambridge, conducted a study, and found out that steroids improved individual’s performance by a percentage of 30%. On the other hand, the drawbacks of using these drugs are numerous. Ċ At first glance, long term use, destroys the athlete’s health and, in most cases, leads to a premature death. Moreover, it can have a tole on the athlete’s hormones, which can result in sterilization. For example, the Worldwide health organization, issued a study, showing that more that 20% of people that have used these drugs are not able to have children. Lastly, enhancing athletes, revokes the purity from sports and makes them unappealing. Ċ Taking everything into consideration, illegal substances are tearing down the sports industry. Thus, people from a young age should be informed about the possible dangers of these and governments should do their best to stop their distribution in order to sustain the value of athleticism."
10420,Television dominates the free time for too many people. It can make people lazy and prevent them from socializing with others. Do you agree or disagree?,"Currently lazy activities, like watching television take a significant part of the free time of many individuals. This tendency could decrease people’s activities and undermine socialization processes. In my perspective, persons should have the right to spend their free time as they want and if watching television enjoyed them, they might watch it and any the social opinion should not have an influence on them. Ċ According to the psychological research, during, pandemic Covid 19 most people had overviewed their life position and understood that everyone should live according to their rules, do what they want to do, because their life is their responsibility, and the thought of other people should not have an effect on them. Before this period, a social reaction had had a significant impact on human life. Persons had lived in this order, even though it did not give them satisfaction, just only because it was right. For instance, Britney Spears had lived over twenty years under the conservatorship of her father, and, according to her statement, had not stopped this case only because frightened from a public reprimand. However, after rethinking all her life possessions, she had decided to go to court. And, finally, she has won it and has obtained independence. This is an example when despite public views, a person does the right thing when it comes to him/her. Ċ Meanwhile, watching television does not have so negative consequences on human health, rather than unhealthy food, smoking, or drugs. This habit cannot destroy social links, because currently, it is not necessary to go out from the home to support the socialization process, modern gadgets could provide communication process in any convenient way. For example, WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, other social networks can bind individuals, who are living from hundred miles from each other. Thus, if this analyzed question does not have so bad effect, as it is commonly believed, there are not any other reasons which can prevent it. Ċ In conclusion, human beings must consider their needs first, any other public opinions do not should influence them. Only this position can bring satisfaction to the human’s life. In my opinion, television is not so bad thing, from those which are existing now, and we do not have any reason and the right to restrict it."
10421,"some people believe that entertainers are paid too much and their impact on the society is negative, while others disagree and believe they deserve money they make because of their positive effects on others. discuss both views and give your opinion","Some argue that celebrities do not contribute anything valuable to the public, although they earn a colossal wage through this profession, whereas others object this notion, saying that they are productive enough to be paid in the such manner. My personal perspective is that entertainers should be receiving a great amount of the money because they deploy their unique talent to entertain the society, despite some provide wrong guidance and an inadequate service. Ċ To begin with, even though celebrities are highly paid, they do not grant a direct service to the state other than entertainment which is non-essential compared with the rest of the profession such as medical, engineering. In fact, they use their popularity and the attractiveness in order to value their demand and some misguide the society through becoming brand ambassadors in socially unacceptable domains such as alcohol, smoking. For an instance, in the UK, the richest category of people are entertainers because they are paid millions of dollars for a single project and some of them even earn through participating advertisements of the brands of alcohol and cigarettes. However, I disagree with this notion because there is a plethora of other ways that they become productive to the population. Ċ On the other hand, entertainers are unique in terms of their inborn skills which they utilize to provide a pleasure to the community. In fact, they relieve stress and provide joy, satisfaction to the people and their own expertise cannot be achieved by the everybody. Moreover, they devote a lengthy duration and make many sacrifices, hardships to cater a successful creation. Therefore, it is indeed justifiable to pay them adequately because their job is not comparable with other careers. For an example, the cricket team of Sri Lanka devotes all their time and dedication to win the Cricket world cup and bring a triumph to the nation. Hence, I agree with this school of thoughts because entertainers represent a whole community. Ċ In conclusion, paying high to celebrities is fair enough because of their unique talent, colossal sacrifices and dedication to entertaining the society, although in some circumstances, their service is not productive and commendable."
10422,"Some people think visitors to other countries should imitate local custom and behaviors. Some people disagree, they think the house country should welcome cultural differences. Discuss the two views and give your opinion. respect for locals and their culture","It may be true for some people traveling overseas have to follow behaviors and values believed by local society while others believe that the home country should appreciate different cultures brought by travelers. This essay will discuss the two points of view. Ċ It is good for foreign people to imitate local custom and behaviors when they travel to other countries. It is a sign that they appreciate what local people believe and it will help them to mingle with everyone who lives there. In addition, it is undeniable that international tourists who behave locally can prevent themselves from conflict with local people because there will be no cultural clash between the local culture and theirs, and they will enjoy their traveling more. For example: to be accepted by the native, European people traveling to Islamic countries should not drink alcohol in public area because it is against Islamic values which forbid Muslim to drink it. Ċ Apart from previous explanation, it is believed that a visited country should accept cultural differences due to several reasons. Foreign travelers may have a hard time and need to take a longer time to adjust to the local culture which is totally new for them so that native people cannot force them to behave as they do. In addition, appreciating new culture shows that local people have high tolerance level and are friendly to welcome anyone who has different behaviors and values. It will be beneficial to boost the number of tourists to that country. Ċ In conclusion, while foreign people are required to appreciate and follow local values because it will help them to mingle easily with natives and have a more enjoyable visit, local people should also welcome other's cultures in order to make them comfortable to live in and increase the potential of their tourism sector."
10423,"in many countries, small shops are closing. why is this happening? is it a positive or negative development.","The business represents an organised effort of an individual or strata of the population engaged in making a living. Due to the advancement of technology, the majority of micro sellers subsequently forced to shut down their enterprise. There are multifarious reasons why small enterprises winding up such as competitive price and constraint in stocking the variety of products. I propound that it is an advantageous process for the development of a country. Ċ One of the foremost causes of diminishing the sole traders is the liberalization of the economy and foreign investment. To gain a customer base multinational companies triggers a price war with local vendors but due to reduced profits micro-merchants are enforced to lock their businesses. For example, Amazon gave big discounts on their website to expand their market reach which hampers the growth of small shops owners. Hence, economic development has certain repercussion on micro industries. Moreover, due to hectic lifestyle people prefer to visit a store where they can find different items under one roof. Ċ As sole traders are diminishing due to the rise in multinational brands ultimately boost the production and maximize the utilization of resources with minimum wastage thus making a product more economical. For instance, China has reduced the input cost by increasing productivity. Therefore, shutting sole enterprise has certain benefits in a longer perspective. Furthermore, micro industries are mostly unorganised so its reduction will uprise the organised sector and help governments to increase tax revenue which could be further invested in economic and social causes. Ċ To conclude, small and big businesses have their own pros and cons. However, promoting the organised sector helps to raise the economic structure and individuals standard of living."
10424,"Many people think it is important to protect environment, but they make no effort on it themselves. Why it is the case and what can we do to change this situation?","Protecting environment is a human obligation, yet it is important as well. Unfortunately, many people less care on it. There are some reasons underlying, why they are to do so. Nevertheless, some possible solutions could be taken into account to address this issue. Ċ In many countries, majority of people are lack awareness upon environmental matter, yet the earth's condition deteriorates over the year. They do not know even the consequences of their careless, towards the entire creature living in the earth. In fact, there are still furthermore, people who throw the garbage everywhere, since they think it is not a big problem as long as their litter will be taken out by cleaning service. Moreover, this bad attitude will influence other people to do similar deed, particularly the children who are sensible. Hence, for these reasons people make not effort to preserve the environment. Ċ Turning to the possible solutions, firstly, the government should campaign regarding environmental issue and foster their societies, especially children and youngster to preserve the environment. A further instance of this, is by giving them an education, such as recycling the items, economizing the electricity and so forth. In addition, the government had better to strict regulation of the waster produced by the companies. These sovereign steps, will lead people to be more sensitive to the environmental issue and encourage them to take care of it. Ċ In conclusion, protecting the environment is a human duty as inhabitant within it. Hence, people are supposed to spread the positive habitual in their daily pursuits to the others to be greener, so that rising people awareness to preserve the environment."
10425,"Some people say it is OK to use animals for our benefit, others say it is not good to exploit them. Discuss both points of view and give your opinion. how people treat animals","Several persons believe that something is not wise to exploit animal, opposite that some human society trusts, we can take benefit from the animal. This writing will discuss both of statements. I totally agree if human take advantage from an animal because one of utilizing animal is created for help human being to survive. Ċ On the one hand, the animal could be utilized for aid sustainability of human life. Some animals are created to assist human such as horse, chicken, cow, and others. Taking an example in my village, local who has a horse, he will be easy to do his daily activity. Go to market, garden, and another place could be reached by a horse. So the animal has an essential position in human life. Ċ On the other hand, mostly people who keep animals even tortured him. They think keeping animal is help their life with giving drink, eat and nursing them. Actually, people keep animal has a good intention but they do with the wrong way. For example, they keep a bird and they were thinking, they help to find food and drinks. The impact the bird will be stressful spend the time merely in the cage. Ċ I agree if we could take benefit from an animal but we have to keep their freedom. In this case, we have to regard and think a good way to treat them. So, their life could be saved and they can get a happiness. Ċ To sum up, keep the animal is good if you can treat with the right way. This article tells us about 2 mindsets human about the the animal. I suggest for government to make a new rule to manage this issue."
10426,Large companies use sports events to promote their products. Some people think this has a negative impact on sports. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?,"Recently, commercial advertisements have proliferated in a variety of television channels, newspapers or magazines as a result of fierce competition in the market. Thus, there is a growing trend in which major companies popularise their products by approaching sports events. Whether it slaves or liberates sports has been a subject of debate. In my viewpoint, I do not lean towards this trend and below is my discussion. Ċ On the one hand, it is widely believed that collaborating with huge companies enables sports events to meet a high quality of facilities and standards. To illustrate, companies are likely to donate money just for the appearances of their logos, brand names or products at those events. Consequently, sports producers can afford high costs of accommodation, devices or lighting. Additionally, watchers can also be beneficial by not having to pay for tickets thanks to sponsors. This means people can have equal opportunities to attend sports events. As a result, this can create a healthy partnership that gains profits for both sides. Ċ On the other hand, I side with those who advocate that advertising can cause unexpecting harm to sports leagues. First of all, there are some misbehaviours of watchers and fans when it comes to unhealthy products. For instance, football fans who are adolescents will be encouraged to consume alcohol or tobacco if they see these products are used by their favourite players. In fact, Tiger-a famous beer company usually appears on sports channels. Secondly, having too many advertisements may offend some audiences since they are easily distracted from watching and as a consequence, some of them tend to lose interest in sports. Literally, they regard sports nowadays as nothing but a tool for the money. Ċ In conclusion, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. I do believe that everything needs a limitation so sports should not rely too much on advertisements."
10427,"children's educational investment. Task 2: Children's education is expensive. In some countries, the government pay some of or all of the costs. Do the advantages outweigh its disadvantages?","In current years, governments allocate their state budgets for supporting partly or totally children's education due to its expensive fees in some corners of the globe. While I accept that this has negative effects on individuals and governments. This is more likely to have outstanding influences Ċ On the one hand, spending a great deal of money on children's education will affect either economy or society. Focusing on children's instruction impact directly on the expenditure on other important aspects. For instance, the healthcare system or infrastructure are not concerned by the government, which is held back from development owing to the lack of attractive investments. Families without children feel unfair when this taxpayers contribute a lot of money for national budgets, which links to social instability. Ċ On the other hand, the above demerits are outweighed by merits. Children's education brings well-educated citizens because children are nurtured in great conditions. Children are encouraged to engage in other fields such as musical instruments, art, dance, ...which help children comprehensive development both physically and mentally. The government creates favourble condition for poorer backgrounds being able to attend to schools equality. In addition to that, parents' s financial burdens are relieved that they can have more money to spend on food, medical care for them. As a result, illiteracy rate will be reduced, and it may significantly contribute to the development of the country due to better workforce. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that the advantages of children's educational investment are more considerable than the possible disadvantages.(250 words)"
10428,Nowadays we see an increase in social problems involving teenagers. Many peope believe that it is because parents spend more time at work and less with their childern. Do you agree or disagree?,"Delinquencies among juveniles are increasing day by day. As both parents are working nowadays, they do not get enough time to look after their children and it is commonly believed as a main reason behind increasing social issues. I firmly agree wit this reason and my inclination are explained in trailed paragraphs. Ċ To start with, children need unconditional love, care and attention in their formative periods of life. As both parents spend long hours at work in this success-oriented world, children's psychological needs to love and to be loves are not fully satisfied, which may compel them to become an antisocial. Moreover, now most of parents connect with their children through electronic gadgets only, which gradually reduces the warmth from the relationships. For example, a survey conducted by a local newspaper, revealed that most of the crimes by teenager are committed in their own home and in the absence of both parents. Ċ Furthermore, if there is no parent at home for a child, he/she may feel isolated and become introvert. Sometimes, children may suffer from depression due to lack of socialization. In addition, such teenagers increase the usage of video games and the Internet. Playing violent games so frequently, can also encourage children to enter into crimes. Therefore, it is the responsibility of parents to keep an eye on their kids, whether they are on the right track or not. Ċ To conclude, as teenage is the turning point of any kid's life, all they need is the proper guidance from their parents. Understanding this phenomenon by every parent is the need of the day."
10429,"People should be responsible for the pollution problems caused by transportation, while others think the government should be held accountable. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Nowadays, pollution to the environment is increasing at alarming rate throughout the world and there is number of serious factors affecting to this cause. One of the main factors to contribute the air pollution is the transportation. Some people argue that individuals should have responsibility for pollutions caused by their cars, while others hold a different opinion saying the government should handle this issue. However, ignoring the individual's responsibility for air pollution is not correct, I think government should introduce regulations to reduce the pollution from vehicles. Ċ As some people say, the pollution from cars could be reduced by giving responsibility to the owner. In order to reduce the air pollution, people should not use the cars which omit much pollution to the air comparing to other environment friendly transportation types. If people feel their responsibility to keep the environment clean and safe, they would not prefer to use the cars. Unfortunately, most people do not care about the impacts from cars to the environment, therefore, some people consider that governments should take this into a considerable account. Ċ To reduce the air pollution from vehicles, governments should introduce some major steps to reduce cars which omit high pollution to the air. One of the steps to reduce air pollution from cars is to decrease the numbers of cars people use. In order to achieve to this goal, government should encourage people to use an environment friendly transportation types. Also, governments should require car owners to pay tax for their responsibility to the air pollution. In some countries, for example in my country, this regulation is started being used in practice. Ċ In conclusion, air pollution becomes a danger for everyone. Therefore, to reduce the air pollution related to human activity, such as pollution from transportation, governments should take some important steps such as collecting tax from cars and promoting people to use environment friendly transportation."
10430,Some people argue that history is of little or no use to us. Others believe that studying history gives many benefits. Discuss those views and give your own opinion.,"There is a belief that it's useless to spend time on studying the history, whereas the counter argument states that it has got many benefits. I support the latter idea, as it is necessary for the growth and prosperity of the society. Ċ On the one hand, some people think that it's a waste of time and resources to learn what our forefathers did in the past and how the civilizations developed. Secondly, they are of the view that the old models have nothing to do with the current era. So, they believe that instead of reading the old tales, it's better to focus on the subjects of science and technology. Moreover, the concept of living has changed so much that the previous experience is of no use. For instance, the same concept is being practiced in the Thailand and they have banned the subject of historical science in the current syllabus. Ċ On the other hand, there are many individuals who are of the idea that nothing can be achieved without studying the lifestyle of previous generations, and I also back the same. The origin of mankind, the developmental stages of the world, the economic growth and the urbanization has to be looked into detail for a better future plans. Furthermore, the problems and their solutions can be found by peeping into the past and learning from the experiences of previous races. For example, the European nations have preserved their heritage as they know that old is gold. Ċ To conclude, the evolution of this globe has to be studied, as it has many hidden road maps which will not only solve many of issues, but will also help in the progress of the nation."
10431,"ALTERNATIVE energy RESOURCES Topic: Fossil fuel such as coal, oil and natural gas are used in many country. The use of alternative source of energy, including wind and solar power is encourage. Is this trend a positive or negative development.","Nowadays human beings are facing the shortage of essential natural resources as coals, oil, which forces us to explore the new ones to provide promptly growing demand of society. Green energy is a wonderful solution addressing the serious problem in terms of there incredible features. Ċ To begin with, conventional fuels hold significant economic cost. A wide range of industries have to spend to much on exploiting raw materials. Moreover the budget of processing domain a large rate on manufacturing cost resulting in inflating selling price and decreasing competitiveness. At the same time, that the fuels are transported from mines to factories also costs much that corporations should attempt to reduce and control this logistics process. Thus, people waste time and money in paying for complex things. Ċ Equally importantly, the utility of non-renewable resources causes serious climate change. Take the case of Shanghai, China as an example. Its residents definately suffer from breathing toxics for numerous factories release contaminated airon generating product from traditional fuels. Unless people use face mask or other protective clothes, they could not go outside whether it is day or night. Ċ Last but not least, Using alternative energy allows society to take full advantage of natural power and maintain our environment balance and health. It is simple for us to acknowledge renewable energy ranging from solar system, heat-themal. Not only do they cost as less as conventional ones but it also impulse the related technology. Furthermore, once being taken into production, green fuels will contribute significant parts into reducing environmental problems. Ċ By way of conclusion, while people are facing the diminish of non-renewable, demand for energy keeps growing. Alternative resources is a effective solution that should be encouraged to use in the near future."
10432,"In some countries, there is not enough recycling of waste materials (e.g. paper, glass, and cans). What are the reasons and solutions?","In some nations, people do not recycle their waste materials as much as they could. There are several reasons why people do not recycle and some approaches should be taken to change such a scenario. Ċ One of the reasons is that people are ignorant about the importance of recycling. They don't know about the process of recycling or the close relation between recycling and environment protection. Furthermore, people are too busy on their own lives to pay enough attention to it. They are used to dispose the rubbish directly for time saving or for convenience. In these situation, government plays an important role to take actions for fear of more harmful behaviors to our environment. Without doing so, it is difficult for people to aware the importance of recycling. Ċ To deal with above problems, several steps can be taken. Government can plan for some advertising campaigns on TV or Internet to teach some tips about recycling. These promotion will catch the public's attention and change their behavior gradually. Otherwise, the education about recycling must be carried out in the school, which can build children's sense of responsibility to protect our environment at their early age. With these efforts, government can not only raise more concern about recycling among people, but also boost the recycling industry because of the potential profits. Ċ In conclusion, the environmental issues are more and more importance. Government around the globe must implement some related policy in order to raise the awareness among people."
10433,Some people feel that the cost of space exploration is far too high for the benefits it brings while others argue that we space programmers should continue no matter what the cost. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.,"There is no doubt that the space is still unexplored and unknown. While some argue that these explorations cost more than its advantages, I believe if we want to expand our knowledge beyond our planet. We should continue this effort. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument. Ċ On the one hand, many feel the budgets of interplanetary missions, such as finding water on Mars, are significant. This is because the technology used in these missions is very expensive. For instance, the rover builds to navigate the Mars' surface was around $10 million. Furthermore, we should also take into account the valuable information it is sending back. Although it might not be useful today, but this can be used as a basis of many researches in the future. If we had this mentality a century ago, we would not have landed on the Moon and Mars. Ċ On the other hand, the rate at which we are ruining our Earth. We will soon need another one. Keeping this in mind, the government should double their efforts toward finding new habitable planets. For example, every country should set up divisions for space exploration. This will create a sense of competition among nations, and will benefit people as a result. In addition, with increasing population. We are running out of land and fresh water. Therefore, spending on these programs is justified. Ċ To conclude, I think this is the right time to increase spending on space programs. With the amount of data that is collected for future use, and the danger of vanishing drinkable water justifies how essential they are."
10434,In many places women are taking jobs which are traditionally done by men. What do you think make these change happen. What's your opinion about it.,"There is currently a contentious argument over about for what reasons females are filling positions which were usually occupied by males in the past. This essay will examine some root causes related to this trend and present my opinion about it. Ċ The main reason for this new behaviour is due to globalization. Nowadays, people are more connected than ever before, which includes the sharing of information in any place; therefore, it is extremely common to spotte women doing some activities that society was not used to see before. For instance, some positions call for a new workforce in the field as a bus driver, that was mainly occupied by men. However, it is normal to see that women accept taking this sort of job since they can not be harassed for being female anymore having no difference in comparison to men's rights. Ċ A second point that shows why the number of women doing these duties has increased is because of society's evolution. The work environment and customs have changed in the last decades regarding the women assessment. As a consequence, the way of thinking of people has changed and the world calls for a society less conservative. If the world has not changed, it would have serious consequences for human being's flourish. To illustrate, it is known that the number of women in the world surpassed the number of men, which means that the environment in different atmospheres tends to change according to each new chapter of history, otherwise, the world would suffer from consequences such as its extinction. Ċ In conclusion, there are a couple of reasons for females have been more acceptable in the labour market. The most important of them is the globalization which bridges for the world's evolution were constructed as well as the society's new evaluation since individuals are having a new point of view on this topic."
10435,Topic: Education is recognized as vital to the future of any society in today's world. Government throughout the world should make education compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 15. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Many people claim that the education is considered as the main key to open a bright future of the world. Considering this, current governments are trying to seize such considerable opportunity by designing a mandatory curriculum for all children from 5 to 15.In my perspective, this method would benefit greatly to both the students' long-term success in career as well as their roles as a good citizen in society. Ċ First and foremost, there is no denying that such educational pattern has made it feasible for the children to form the basic knowledge as a firm background to have a good job. Apparently, at this age, students are likely to acquire the lessons more easily due to their sensitive brain cognition. Hence, the approach to higher education would be highly probable, leading to bright employment prospects. For example, well-educated students tend to be applied for leading company rather than those who are not allocated any. In short, the application of the compulsory curriculum has a positive impact on the students' future. Ċ Likewise, this mandatory schooling performs a very crucial role in imposing ethics in students' behaviors. Children are easily influenced by social factors and therefore the schools' responsibility for adjusting their attitudes must be addressed. In particular, teachers are the supervisors who assist the students in being a good citizen by organizing a subject called civic education. Otherwise, without any morality at this initial stage, these pupils are likely to have a false conception in behaving, resulting in the severe consequences such as school violence, drug abuse and more. Ċ To conclude, I have to reiterate the significance of compulsory education in opening up opportunities for students to have an ideal career as long as improving the moral standard in students' behaviors."
10436,sedentary lifestyle in urban areas Topic: It is difficult for people in the cities to get enough exercise. What are the causes and solutions?,"There has been an ever-increasing trend that citizens from urban areas are less likely to take up enough exercise. This issue can be ascribed to a wide range of reasons and it must be addressed with feasible actions. Ċ There are two main explanations why people are leading a sedentary lifestyle in metropolitan cities. One of the main reasons why people do not spend sufficient time on exercising is due to the typical hustle and bustle of living in cities. Commonly, young adults are snowed under exhausting computer work and deadlines in hot pursuit, which prevent them from making a thorough plan for doing exercises. As a result, they feel obligated to sacrifice their time working out at the gym in order to gain better job prospects. Another reason paving the way to reduced exercising hours is the rapid advances in technology and the tremendous growth in amusing TV programs. Particularly, a technology-orientated lifestyle has become increasingly popular among adolescents, which acts as a deterrent from enjoying outdoor recreational pursuits. Ċ A wide range of definite actions must be implemented to combat an idle lifestyle stemming from insufficient exercising hours. One effective solution is to enhance public awareness of the benefits of taking up exercise. For example, citizens will be more mindful of doing exercise daily if they are encouraged through the mass media. Furthermore, the government should consider healthcare as the top priority and provide public subsidies on the construction of sports facilities. Newly-equipped essential sports gear will therefore increase the chance of people getting involved in physical activities by making it more accessible and affordable. Ċ In conclusion, fast pace and technological innovations mainly contribute to lack of exercising in cities, and thorough preparation is key to avoid this negative trend by a number of remedies such as heightened awareness and government sponsorship."
10437,Film stars and celebrities often share their views on public matters that have little to do with their profession. Ċ Is this a positive or negative development?,"It is common for famous figures with large platforms to share their viewpoints on various topics. In my opinion, though there is potential for abuse, it is positive overall as they can contribute diverse perspectives. Ċ Critics of the publicity celebrities receive for their comments argue they are not always well informed. There are experts in every field, ranging from politics and science to sports and the arts and yet stars in the entertainment world possess outsized platforms. For instance, many actors, athletes, and singers have become part of the anti-vaccination movement. The views of health experts and epidemiologists are often subordinated to celebrity comments more likely to generate online traffic and ratings. However, this argument is undermined by research showing that professionals are notoriously poor at making predictions concerning their own areas of expertise. Ċ Moreover, celebrities in film and music engender diversity. The entertainment world, relative to other professional spheres, is made up of a wide variety of ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds. Most actors move to Hollywood from a different part of the world and then later become stars. In the music industry, listeners actively seek out new voices, styles, nationalities, and personalities. These individuals can then provide the average person with an insightful glimpse into another part of society. The most recent example of this would be the awareness raised related to environmental issues by various singers and actors when they accept awards. Ċ In conclusion, although there is a risk that celebrities will be uninformed on a topic, their opinions are still important as they are typically candid, authentic, and diverse. In this era of inclusivity, it is important to value all viewpoints."
10438,More and more people are using internet nowadays for their personal thing such as shopping and paying bills. Does advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"These days people have been using online facilities for their convenience. While an increasing number of the public have been ordering products and paying invoices online, I agree with this statement, and I will discuss how e-shops are beneficial and unsafe to the community in this essay. Ċ The benefits of e-commerce are significant. Firstly, it is widely applied in shopping a varied range of items simply by sitting home; however, time for researching the products is required. In other words, customers can order any products by going through their reviews by staying back at home. Additionally, they can pay any invoices by website portals; consecutively, they save time and transportation expenses. For example, I usually spend my water bills and mobile recharge on legal outlets of their company. Hence, e-shops are more advantageous to humankind these days. Ċ On the other side, there are fewer drawbacks to be considered on e-commerce. The First and foremost reason is that customers have a higher chance of getting cheated by hackers through illegal websites of their business. That is to say; web criminals are more competent these days to misuse the internet facilities when innocents order through fraudulent networking websites. Besides, adolescence and adults are becoming inactive because of more convenient shopping with the help of e-stores. To illustrate this, for instance, one of my friends have never shopped traditionally for the past five years; eventually, she became more obese because of her sedentary lifestyle. Thus, people must be cautious about unsafe links and health issues that internet facilities cause. Ċ In conclusion, though e-shops have fewer drawbacks in money safety and health problems, it provides people with the benefits of convenience and less time consumption. Therefore, I believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
10439,essay about the tourism industry TOPIC: International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Are the problems that international travellers cause greater than the advantages they bring?,"It is true that the international tourism industry has become more popular than before. Although there are those who may argue that this is a negative trend, I hold the belief that the advantages behind this trend far outweigh its drawbacks. Ċ From my perspective, environment protection is the first and foremost issue nowadays. However, we all know that the fast development in the tourism industry would bring some problem to our society and there is a dilemma between development and environment. In the past, people could go to a beach and appreciate the beauty of sunset happily but now we seldom have a chance to do that because of the pollution. Many tourist attractions have been destroyed and lose their colourful scenery due to the prosperity in the tourism industry. Ċ In spite of the above arguments, I still see this is a positive trend. The foremost reason for my point is that the development of international tourism improves our economic growth and even creates more job opportunities than before. Some traditional stores near a tourist attraction mainly depend on travellers to survive, and also many people work as a tour guide or offer a service to visitors. Moreover, governments could not only make more money from the tourism industry but also promote countries around the world. As a result, the development of international tourism is a positive evolution. Ċ In conclusion, there are some pros and cons to this development, and I believe that this is a benefit in our lives."
10440,Young people spend less of their free time with their family nowadays. What at the reasons for this? Are there more negative or postive sides to it?,"Family values have been sacrificed under the impression of western countries and the race of wanting more forces each individual to pull their best in their field; consequentially, they have lesser time to spend with their loved ones. There are other reasons too that contribute to this happening are explained in the following paragraphs along with the positive and negative impressions of the aforementioned statement. Ċ The first and foremost reason for this is that a highly competitive environment pushes citizens to work from head to toe to achieve excellence and desired position in their field; the tremendous outside pressure enforces youngsters to think out of the box. In other words, adolescents have less time, nowadays, to share their feelings and prospects with their caretakers. Apart from that, the exposure of international cultures and establishment of global firms in their home country lure teens to enjoy freedom, thereby, instead of spending their leisure hours with their family, they opt to go out with their friends to watch movies and other fun activities. Ċ This phenomenon has more negative impacts than positive outcomes. Firstly, teenagers could not understand and respect their family's culture as well values; they might be refused to follow their forefathers' traditions. Eventually, the customs could be lost if they are followed. Secondly, the parents or grandparents feel lonely as their offspring have no time to communicate with them and parents try to arrange something special so that they can spend some seconds with their children. For instance, in most of the western cultures, especially grandparents have arranged parties for birthdays and anniversaries that they can get a chance to talk to their family teens. The only positive outcome of this is that youngsters could be more independent as they choose to make their decision by themselves. Ċ To conclude then, the outside tremendous pressure and experience of western societies keep teens busy and they have less time for their family, but juveniles could lose the importance of their culture and parents could feel lonely if adolescents run at the same pace."
10441,Some of the methods used in advertising are unethical and unacceptable in today's society. To what extend you agree or disagree. plethora of advertisement nowadays,"It is often said that plethora of advertisement nowadays make use of inappropriate and improper contents. Although commercials play an important role on product marketing, I completely agree with this argument and I believe that such immoral and unethical propagation approaches shall be regulated by laws. Ċ To begin with, it is undeniable that random calls and junk mails are disturbing to our daily lives. People receive cold calls from many companies, especially cosmetics and insurance industries. Overwhelming advertisements are about irrelevant products' promotions. Such widespread phenomenon is extremely annoying and adversely influencing people's livelihoods. For example, Hong Kong citizens receive more than 10 random calls about promoting goods every day, while corresponding regulation has been imposed to govern the abuse of cold calls. Ċ Equally importantly, false contents are usually displayed to exaggerate the product's effectiveness. Cosmetic companies, for instance, often overemphasize the product's effects on beauties. As a result, customers would be misled to purchase such items without desired changes. Ċ Last but not least, numerous companies deliver the deceptive images of their products. Cigarette is a case in point. The tobacco companies usually invite some famous movie stars to smoke in front of the camera. As a result, teenagers would imitate, and be addicted to smoking consequently. Ċ In conclusion, there are considerable numbers of advertisements adopting immoral and unethical approaches to attract people's eye. Random calls create unnecessary nuisance to the public, while the images and effectiveness of tobacco and cosmetic goods are reshaped in order to enhance their popularity. Thus, stringent legislation shall be imposed to govern the practices of advertisement."
10442,"Some people say language courses using the internet and allowing you to talk to somebody is a good way to learn. Others, however, believe that study in classrooms is still the best way of learning. Give your opinion on these views and include your own experiences and examples.","Nowadays many people try to learn new languages for the purposes of higher studies as well as for immigration to foreign countries. Some people feel that learning a language using internet and talking to someone online is a good way to learn whereas others believe that conventional methods of studying in classrooms is the best way .Both the opinions will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached. Ċ It is felt by many that learning a language using internet offers a wide range of data pertaining to vocabulary and accuracy of the language. Further, an individual may learn a new language without an extra effort of going to classes. For instance, many Asian students who aspire to pursue their higher education in English speaking countries such as Canada, Australia and England choose distant online courses for learning English. This saves their time as they can learn new words and their meanings just on the click of a button. Thus, it is clear why this argument has garnered a lot of support. Ċ However, learning a language in classroom offers different benefits. Students can do group discussions and further discuss their own problems with the teachers. Moreover, teachers can cater to the needs of individual student. It is reported by many students that even if they choose online courses for learning, eventually they join classes for better understanding of the language and its practice. Thus, it is seen clearly why classrooms are still the best way of learning. Ċ Therefore, to conclude it can be said that although learning online offers comfort and access to wide range of data but learning in a classroom has advantages such as group discussions and motivation by teachers. So, it is opined that classroom learning has greater benefits than learning online."
10443,"People should choose their course of study not on the basis of their own interests, but based on the kinds of jobs they can get. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.","Although many people argue that choosing study courses should be in line with the desired future careers, others are convinced by selecting the curriculum on the basis of their interests, which I support. In this essay, I will explain the main reasons for my perspective. Ċ On the one hand, some people prefer to choose study courses, which are matched with high-wage jobs. This is because those who support this idea tend to increase their future income. Medical college, for example, in Egypt, is the first choice for the majority of pupils owing to its high profit. However, there are some difficulties to achieve this dream. Firstly, those colleges, due to its high demand, they require a high score in secondary schools. Secondly, if most students tend to pursue in those colleges, the workforce market will suffer from the lack of other disciplines. Ċ On the other hand, I hold the notion that students should select their colleges based on their skills and capabilities. The main reason is that some colleges may require a unique talent, which may not suit everyone. Faculty of fine arts, for instance, demands special skills such as painting or drawing. Another valid reason is that if anyone masters a profession, he or she can find a job. To illustrate, abstract artists are in high demand in the labour market due to their talent, and many companies are paying high salaries to them. Ċ In conclusion, despite the interest of some students to choose courses to earn a high income, there are some problems may face them in terms of skills, aggressive entry requirements, and it is quite possible to find better jobs if you the practical experience."
10444,"Topic: Some say that today's life is better than it will be in the future, others disagree and say that the future life will be better than now. Discuss and include your own opinion.","Some people doubt about whether future life would be improved or not. Some people imagine the future life as like a scenery of movie named ""Travel to Future"" in which it shows a flying car in the sky. However, other sees the life in the future as a pessimistic view in which people tries escape from natural disaster and moves to Himalayas mountain. In this essay, i will examine a both sides of view and present my personal view on this matter. Ċ On the one hand, there are number of people holding a view that the world would be catastrophic. Due to the fact of a increasing change of climate and high frequency of natural disaster like hurricane, tornado, flood and earthquake, discomfort of living will increase in the next coming centuries. Moreover, as the world population rises, a increasing need of food supply rises among the nations, particularly among developing and third nations. Therefore, rate of famine and hunger increases and level of food safety deteriorates. Ċ On the other hand, much optimism about the future with technological development is hold among people. They anticipate the future life with clean energy, clean electricity and clean environment. The world would be totally green then ever before due to the initiatives of green technologies. Pleasure of life will increase with introduction of new technology into our daily life like travel to outer space and so on. Ċ In the conclusion, i am totally convinced with the view that in coming years, your generation will live in much dangerous condition. Due to a increasing level of various kind of pollution, health concern will arise among them and cost of health will stagger dramatically."
10445,"Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? Use specific reasons and examples tosupport your opinion.","A change should be done effectively if we want to progress more in the future. There is a burgeoning question in regards to changing old, historical infrastructure with modern building. There are two facets in this issue. In my opinion, the degree of modernizing a city lies on the effectiveness of a project in projecting its significance in the future. Ċ Old infrastructure should be destruct if we find any significance for this change. If the building begins to obstruct a street and causes a lot of traffic then it is prudent that we should torn down this building regardless of its significance. Moreover, most of old infrastructures have a poor fire safety and the immediate treat from the neighborhood is in question. This in turn also may give a significant reason for a building to be destroyed. Ċ However, We should not destroy them entirely just because we feel that we need to change these to a new building. Most of the historical buildings have significant values in the city development. Losing it will deprive education and appreciation of our younger generation. However, destroying an infrastructure is not a sole option for modernizing a city. Most of the technology today can aim on relocating this building to other site, which can also preserve its values. Ċ In my opinion, as we aim to develop a futuristic city we should still take account on the marvelous artifacts that we have in the past. Technological breakthroughs have made these possible for us."
10446,Topic: In some countries older people are being encouraged to work longer and not to retire. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working beyond retirement age.,"Across the globe there is a growing trend of increasing the retirement age or working after retirement. People are cheered to work longer. Every coin has two sides ; Similarly, working longer has its own Pros and Cons. In this essay, I will be presenting my views on advantages and disadvantages on prolonged working. Ċ There are positives of working longer not only to individual but to the society and country as well. Socially, with age comes experience and people are motivated to work longer so that their experience can be best utilized and may help in development of the country and its economy. On the personal front, people who work at an older age remains active and does not feel aloof at home. From economic point of view, people are less dependent on others and as they are working , they pay tax and contribute to country's economy instead of becoming a drain to the economic system. Ċ However, there are many negatives of working longer. First of all, increasing retirement age may lead to more job requirements for youth and finally result in more unemployment for young generation which is a serious problem in almost every developing and under developed countries. Secondly, at a higher age people may face health issues and their degraded health may create serious problems for them .Last but not the least, at an higher age humans cant be as productive as youngsters and would contribute to a less efficient and less productive system which is not desirable in this competitive era. Ċ In conclusion, Working longer has its own advantages like self-dependency , contribution in country's economy contrarily that may cause problems like unemployment for youths; less productive and inefficient system. I believe, citizens should consider both sides of the coin and then decide how long to work."
10447,"Some people think that boarding schools are an exellent option for children, while other people disagree for a number of reasons. Consider both sides of this debate and reach a conclusion boarding school? not for all","In recent years, many young people study in boarding school where they live and stay at the school environtment during the term. It is often said that parents benefit from sending their children to other place to study. However, the issue is not entirely straightforward, and arguments can also be made againt the idea. This essay will discuss the debate, and give a conclusing view. Ċ On the one hand, those who support their children to study in boarding school cite the various advantages that the activity can bring to a child. First, pupil can learn about how to live independently. Obviously, it will useful for them in their future to solve many problem by theirself. In addition, children who live in one place with their friends can discuss about the learning that they just got in school. Therefore, some parents think that boarding school is an exellent option for children to study Ċ By contrast, opponents of this view point out that not all children want to stay far away from their parents. A large number of parents believe that they have responsibility to teach children by themself until become adult. They think that it can be harmful for kids to stay in another place without their supervision. As an instance, children could be more lazy to study without motivation from parents. Thus, the drawbacks should be consedered as well. Ċ In conclusion, it seems advisable that the decision to send children to boarding school should be based on child's capability and interest, an also the quality of the boarding school itself to guarantee proper life and supporting environtment to study."
10448,Some people believe that schools should reward those students who show excellent academic performance while some believe that only the ones who show significant improvement in the grades should be rewarded. Ċ Discuss both the views and give your opinion. Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"For many decades education institutions have been encouraging students by rewarding them. Although some may argue that schools should only be rewarding school children who are excelling academically, I believe they should be doing the same for pupil who are improving. This essay will discuss both views of the statement. Ċ Students who are doing well academically need rewarding as it takes a lot of hard work and sacrifices to achieve high grades. For instance, a student replaces hanging out with friends and other leisure activities to study. This group of children is self-derived and therefore, need to be rewarded for putting in extra time and replacing relaxing to work harder. Ċ On the other hand, not all students do well academically. This is either because of other interests such as sports or learn differently. Most schools teach traditionally, while new generation schools are now taking a new approach. Take the UK for example, some schools are educating weaker students with a different approach which has led to improvement in grades and consequently, giving out certificates for students who put in the effort. Though this notion is motivating students to carry on working hard as their effort is working while not everyone is invested to change the traditional way of learning. Ċ To conclude, undoubtedly high scoring students do not need any motivation as they are self motivated, while underachievers do need motivation in the form of rewards to stay on the right path to success. I do believe, schools should investigate their way of teaching and use more visual tools for helping students."
10449,Many people are doing their shopping on the internet nowadays. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages if shopping online and give your opinion.,"With technological advancements, online shopping has opened doors globally, where infinite articles can be purchased by customers in a finite ways with just a click of a button. In this essay, I will discuss both merits and demerits which will be discussed in the latter part. Ċ Firstly, with cut throat competition amongst competitors, the prices are slashed in order to keep their potential customers intact. As a result, the consumers are benefited in monetary terms. Lastly, one hectic task in traditional shopping is that, layman commutes to different places where they can purchase according to their tastes and preferences. But, by sitting at home E-commerce segregates valuable commodity from a wide range of varieties with relevance to pattern, size, fabric and brands which save time and avoids stress. For example, an article being published by Hindustan times that 80% of beloved customers of Amazon are satisfied with bumper offers and filtered options available in selecting goods or services. Hence, reliable sources of shopping will have a record sale through online shopping. Ċ On the contrary, the delivery system of goods is absolutely tedious. The goods will not be delivered within a given time period and sometimes inappropriate articles will be dropped at the door steps. In addition, buyers often use credit or debit cards for transaction payment. If, the hacker hacks customer account, personal details and passwords can be misused for stealing money. For instance, snap deal delivers wrong items 5% of the time, particularly cash payments and Flipkart sells stolen data to banks for a ransom figure. Hence, cash on delivery and net bank payments should be avoided at all costs. Ċ To conclude, as online shopping has numerous examples which serves the sole purpose of purchases because customer is always king. However, the disadvantages can be overlooked with security updates in the mere future."
10450,The prevention of health problems and illness is more important than treatment and medicine. Government funding should reflect this. Ċ To what extent do you agree?,"It is acknowledged that prevention is better than cure, which means that preventing health issues and diseases is far superior to curing them. In my opinion, I firmly agree with the notion that the government should allocate healthcare funds that will help people prevent themselves from health complications. Ċ To begin with, there are two major points for people to defend the view that prevention is better than cure. First of all, it is a well-documented fact that it proves more sustainable. Scientifically, human health can be reinforced and maintained effectively in the long term via varied approaches like dieting, exercising, and even spiritual therapy. If people remain vigilant to avoid severe ailments, they stand a lower chance of contracting them. Furthermore, this strategy appears more time- and cost-effective. For instance, once a patient is diagnosed with cancer, he or she will either pour their fortunes into immediate treatment. All this money can be well-saved, and time can be lengthened because of proper preventative schemes. Ċ Further, an individual should treat themselves according to diseases and illnesses in order to stay in good health. Subsequently, the government should also spend more funds on medical research that would protect humankind from diseases. With the help of research, scientists will be able to find the cause and cure of many diseases that would apparently cost a fortune for the treatment. For example, scientists could not find a feasible treatment or cure for the fatal coronavirus disease, despite strong technological advancements. Due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 virus, countries across the world witnessed a high death toll with many fatalities and mortalities. Ċ In conclusion, I certainly believe that the government should invest funds appropriately in the healthcare system as a priority and motivate people about preventable measures to stay healthy and save on bills."
10451,Some people think that the best way to improve road transport safety is to let the driver test each year. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In this day age, the number of road accidents has increased exponentially the world over only because of reckless driving. Consequently, there has been a growing body of opinion that road transport safety can only be improved by conducting a driving test every year. Being a rational mind, I, too assent to this notion, for I am of the view that this will help drivers to update themselves about the latest rules and regulations, and to check their physical capability for driving. Ċ Among the ratiocination to buttress my stance, the one that deals with the significance of driver testing as a way to test the drivers know about the updated roads’ rules. In other words, governments of every nation try to impose new regulations constantly by charging the old ones in order to increase road safety. So, if drivers could not know the latest laws, it would be impossible for them to obey those statutes. Therefore, drover testing ought to be conducted each year so as to ensure safety. To cite an example, an empirical study conducted by Oxford University reveals that 95% of drivers can drive properly on roads if they give a yearly exam on driving rules and regulations. Ċ Another critical rationale in reference to why drivers should give a test every year is necessarily synonymous with checking their physical fitness. To be more precise, an individual’s health can deteriorate any time down to having some disorders, such as cardiovascular disease, poor eyesight, to name but a few. Thus, if a person could know his physical weakness by giving a driving test, it would surely reduce the chances of accidents. To exemplify, researchers around the world have found that 30% of road accidents occur because of drivers' heart failure during the driving time. Hence, it is inevitable to check physical well-being at least once a year by giving a driving test. Ċ In conclusion, each year, drivers should test their capability with a view to updating themselves about new things and checking their fitness."
10452,With a fast pace of modern life more and more people are turning towards fast food for their main meals. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Whether going for unhealthy cuisine or home-made foodstuff is a controversial issue in the contemporary world. People are divided in their opinion regarding fast feed as a healthy meal. However, I believe that fast cuisine may have numerous drawbacks that can be detrimental not only for the present generation for also for the coming generation. I wholeheartedly believe that this trend should be changed and will discuss the demerits in the following paragraphs with supporting examples. Ċ To embark on, it is obvious that the daily consumption of fast food can lead to various health issues such as obesity, diabetes, and blood pressure.In addition to this, modern society may have an issue in retaining the stamina for a long moment which will have an impact on their personal as well as professional life. To elucidate, a recent study demonstrates that nearly 91.46% of individuals are relying on junk snack as they consider making cuisines at home as a waste of time. Moreover, masses may lack various factors that play a vital role in the growth of their body most notable nutrients from healthy foodstuff. Ċ Similarly, there is no doubt that consuming fast food have advantages as well such as it is time-saving. In other words, people can save their time by intaking junk food as it does not demand preparation. It is widely accepted that individuals spend lots of money on quickly based foods as they are expensive as compared to non-readymade foods. To illustrate, professionals buy foodstuff either online or from the restaurant due to pace inefficiency. Furthermore, this can have an adverse effect on their body and mind that can have an impact on their life. In other words, Nutritains claim that masses who adapt unhealthy meal in their life may be a patient of Cancer. Ċ To conclude, taking everything into account, I believe, intake of the unhealthy meal should be reduced and people can replace fast snack by preparing a healthy meal for a week and can consume it throughout conservative days by freezing the preparation in order to say time."
10453,Some people think that young people can learn useful skills by playing electronic and computer games. Others argue that people who play electronic and computer games are wasting their time. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"Nowadays, there are enormous fun activities in which a child can participate. Some people claim that young individuals should get involved in playing electronic and computer games. While others assert that these interests only waste the time. In this essay, I will discuss both the views. Ċ On the one hand, supporters for engaging children in electronic devices and playing on a monitor believe that these interests help a young individual to think in a rational way. Furthermore, playing a game on the PC requires lots of different visual perspectives and only with a correct decision, to enable a player to win the game. For instance, in many puzzle play, or brain stimulation words games could be a better option to help the child to increase their vocabulary and keep their brain active. Thus, such gaming can cultivate a wider perspective in a child which is certainly a vital skill. Ċ On the other hand, society opposes that children should not play games on the PC and electronic devices, they explain in their favour that young people should more concentrate on their academics than on gaming. Indeed, there are a plethora of other activities like sports,exercise and yoga classes, in which a minor can take part to spend his leisure time. Moreover, PC games are addictive in nature which can have a detrimental impact on his/her life. Hence, due to these reasons, people emphasize more on other activities rather than the aforementioned. Ċ To conclude, although involving in computer activities can promote the cognitive abilities in the young one, the side-effects of these recreations cannot be ignored. I believe young individuals should not only play games on the computer because of their negative consequences on their mind and behaviour but also there are more ways that children can learn similar skills in other activities."
10454,Private companies that support and carry out scientific research are spending more than governments in these days. Do the advantage of this development outweigh Its disadvantage..? Explain and give your reasons.,"Private companies provide significant contribution in scientific research. Government are insufficient to provide resource to all scientific research because it has to allocate budgets for the entire field. IN this essay, I will explore both advantages and disadvantages about private company contribution in scientific research. Ċ Private companies contributes larger amount to discover medicines for new diseases. For example, medicines for AIDS, polio, chicken box vaccinations, etc., are very useful to mankind. Moreover, scientific research in test tube baby by private organization is a great revolution in medical field. It helps parents who are infertile enables to get baby from their genes. Ċ On the other hand of the coin, separate companies can sell copyrights and procedures of the medical scientific research like cloning, genetics, etc., to terrorist groups which would be a great disaster. Furthermore, private companies may involve in anti-human scientific research for great profit. For example, anthrax, highly infectious disease which Americans are feared to attack by bio-terrorist in last decades. In addition, private companies research and develop in different new types of nuclear weapons, chemical bombs which can be sold to terrorist. Ċ For instance, a report claimed that Pakistan terrorist used chemical bombs in karkil war on Indian military which is illegally mad by the private research company sold to the terrorist. Ċ By analysing both advantages and disadvantage about wealth contribution by private research organization was, helpful for both human and anti-human researches. Government should take necessary action to prevent anti-human scientific research by the private companies. So that future scientific research would be substantial assistance to human race."
10455,"In the modern world it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via Internet and live without any face-to-face contact with others. Is it a positive or negative development in your opinion","There is no doubt to say that people, in recent years, have witnessed the prevalence of Internet-based communication, shopping, and transaction activities. In my opinion, This development has shown both positive and negative aspects equally. Ċ On the one hand, unrestricted access to the Internet has brought great benefits to the public for its convenience and comfort. Firstly, telecommunication tools including email, instant messaging or social networks facilitate people's interaction, bringing them closer together. For example, if an international student wants to contact his family, it will be convenient to deliver a message only at a click regardless of geographical barriers. Secondly, this improvement of technology allows shoppers can seek out items or services of the finest quality without engaging lengthy commutes. As a result, this might prevent them from bad conditions, such as traffic congestion, torrential rain while they are moving. Ċ On the other hand, certain detriments can be associated with excessive Internet use. This is because the over-reliance on virtual communication is the primary cause of the decline in social skills which are crucial for real-life contact. To clarify this point, there is a heavy number of social network users tend to feel awkward while trying to strike up conversations with strangers. Thus, these people would gradually become more socially alienated and suffer from a great sense of solitude. Furthermore, This trend can be detrimental to persons' physical and mental health. If humans were overindulgent in the online world, it undoubtedly triggers a sedentary lifestyle, which consequently leads to some health-related problems such as obesity or sleep deprivation. Ċ In conclusion, although the online network contributes several benefits, I think negative impacts on lifestyle and health should be taken into account for uncontrolled online use for shopping, working and communication purposes."
10456,hectic pace and pressure of contemporary lifestyles Some people believe that the fast pace and stress of modern life is having a negative effect on families. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?,"A highly controversial issue today relates to whether family life is being detrimentally affected by the hectic pace and pressure of contemporary lifestyles. From my point of view, I totally agree with this opinion due to the two main reasons. Ċ First of all, I would contend that families have less time to gather around because of the high-speed modern days. This may result from members being preoccupied with work and their social lives. These days, people are often so busy updating their social status or chatting with friends that they forget to spend time with their beloved, Ċ not to mention the fact that they only have about six hours in the evening to meet their family members. Ċ Another reason why I support the notion is that people are more likely to argue with each other under great pressure. It is concerned that when getting tired, humans stand bigger chance of being easily annoyed and therefore, quarrel. In the actual world, some married couples eventually choose to get divorced and leave an irreplaceable position in their offspring 's growth. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that the fast-moving and stressful nature of the current competitive world are ruining family relationships. This is owing to family members having less time together and hence, feeling less relaxed. The best prospect might be that the family members try to be more supportive of each other and meet more frequently."
10457,Some people are of the opinion that children should be rewarded for good behavior. Others think they should be punished for bad behavior. Discuss both views and give your personal opinion and reasons.,"It is often considered by many people that young kids ought to be rewarded for their good deeds, whereas other argues that punishment should be given for the misdeeds of a juvenile. Although,Remove the commaapplyIt appears that you have an unnecessary comma after the subordinating conjunction Although. Consider removing the comma. Ċ show examples discipline may act as a deterrent towards bad nature, I believe that the most effective way to achieve a good attitude could be to reward teenagers. This essay would discuss the above arguments in detail. Ċ Firstly, rewarding a good act immediately signals a positive sign in the kid’s brain which encourage the adolescent to want to behave again in the future. Failure to recognize such behaviour leaves the youngster with the feeling that they had not done anything. Thus, rewarding the toddler consistently for the good deeds motivates the child to repeat those things over and again. Ċ Secondly punishing your child is also necessary, failure to discipline could result have serious consequences in the future. For instance, if a toddler has no clear concept of respect for elders or authority it is quite possible to encounter more serious issues later in life. It is essential to immediately discipline the infant whenever witnessing an unruly act so as to enforce the correct behaviour from an early age. In my view, any positive actions should be recognized by the parents and vice versa for negative conduct. This balanced approach makes for a more positive outcome for both the infant and family. Ċ To conclude, recognizing both bad and good actions immediately and dealt with them immediately to correct or encourage future actions."
10458,The internet has made traditional libraries unnecessary. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Discuss giving examples from your own knowledge andexperience.,"Some people adhere to the view that with the extensive use of the Internet, libraries are no longer necessary. They believe that the Internet offers every information anyone can search. Ċ Furthermore, through the numerous websites available in it, students and researchers can presently obtain tremendous resources for the completion of their paperwork. Additionally, its accessibility can be reflected by the infinite availability of various websites. Tremendous sites for newspapers, magazines, journals and encyclopedias are equally accessible. Moreover, a researcher can have the opportunity to enjoy a complete multimedia experience through the presence of texts, videos, interactive features, audio, hyperlinks and graphics in one place. Ċ On the contrary, libraries can bind a unique part in the hearts of some people. It is because, libraries frequently bring nostalgia and a particular feeling, while touching the bounds of the books and smelling their pages. Aside from that reason, the organization of the tremendous resources in a library makes it easier for someone to explore into a specific reference. That is made possible through the universal cataloguing system. Apart from that, libraries offer free Internet connection and other electronic resources, like CD-ROM. Consequently, impoverished students can access the Internet, without spending even a single penny. Ultimately, knowledgable reference librarians are employed to assist researchers. These professionals have the ability to locate a vast number of literary works from a broad range of categories. This, being mentioned, represent the utmost factor, which is missing on the Internet. Ċ In my experience, during my college years, I always prefer conducting my research studies in our university library. I found it immensely practical since I could perform my study both with books and a computer with unlimited Internet access. Throughout my four years of studying, its convenience was a vital aid for my time management and monetary allowance. Ċ In conclusion, embracing modernization does not imply that traditional sources should be disregarded. Therefore, I believe libraries can be of the same importance as that of the Internet."
10459,"Nowadays, most information is available online, whereas in the past knowledge was used to be stored in books and on paper. Do you think the advantages of this situation outweigh its disadvantages?","Nowadays, it is commonly believed that philosophy plays an important role in social development and no one can deny it. However, in recent years we have witnessed that science is more accessible online rather than in paper form. I personally believe that this issue has much more positive effects than drawbacks. Ċ First of all, one of the merits of this matter is the number of articles which could be attained. In fact, if the datum is online much more materials are available. Therefore, the more material provided, the more comprehensive researches are achieved. As an instance, when I wanted to start my academic research, a various array of statistics was acquired using the internet. Ċ In addition, data transferring velocity could be considered as the second benefit of a knowledge network. In other words, not only is the datum accessible widely but also the process is so fast. Consequently, by applying the search engines, by far faster the data could be approachable. To illustrate more, as soon as a subject is entered in the Google toolbar plenty of reports is prepared only in a few seconds. Ċ Furthermore, the last upside of the web-based extension of know-how which could be highlighted is its easier accessibility. To be more precise, only by having a smartphone with an internet connection there would be an ocean of diverse features available, anywhere, anytime. As an example, when someone is waiting at the bus station he can search and read a special topic on his cell phone, even if he is not in a university library. Ċ In conclusion, by considering the aforementioned reasons, available goods amount, data transmission pace, and easier approachability, I hold the view that virtual science availability has numerous positive impacts on scientific advancement."
10460,Our planet covered by rubbish. It is generally agreed that the amount of rubbish created by humans today is a worldwide problem. What do you think are the main causes of this situation? What measures used to tackle?,"Rubbish is created by humans all over the world, which is gradually increasing, especially over the last decades. Although a myriad of reasons and methods is provided by activists and scientists, the problem has become a global issue, which should be solved as soon as possible. Ċ There is an abundance of reasons for this issue is a global problem. Firstly, a huge amount of trash is one of the major reasons causes environmental problems such as air pollution and climate change nowadays. For example, since burning plastic and chemical rubbish creates a huge amount of carbon dioxide, which is emitted directly into the air which contributes to global problems including air pollution. Moreover, if rubbish is dumped into the river systems, it will destroy the marine animal system there. For instance, by throwing trash, such as plastic bag and non-recyclable trash, away to the river system, which causes death to many fish and other aquatic animals. Ċ Today, some measures are now used to combat this problem. The most effective way to fight climate change is reducing the dependence on plastic bags and other rubbish in general. This could be using paper bags and another kind of recyclable material instead of plastic, which reduces rubbish is created by humans. Furthermore, since alleviate environmental problems is caused by rubbish, we can collect trashes and use alternative energy sources. Ċ Trash and issues surrounding it is a global problem, which impacts on every person all over the world. I believe that to decrease the greenhouse effects people should be aware of tackle environmental problems."
10461,"In some countries, schoolchildren wear a uniform. In others, they can wear whatever they want at school. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having school uniforms?","In some parts of the world, wearing a uniform is mandatory for students, however, pupils living in other Ċ nations are free to put on any clothes at school. While putting on this might reduce discrimination in our society and recognize easily which school children are studying, it also has negative effects which need to be taken into account. Ċ Firstly, one advantage of having school uniforms is that there will be no discrimination between the rich and the poor. Indeed, school uniforms tend to be cheaper than any casual or trendy clothes which wealthy students want to wear to show off with their peers. Take those living in poor housing conditions, for instance, they can afford them easily without worrying about their prices. Secondly, another benefit is that it is easy to identify schools' names in the public instead of investing money in media advertising, this practice helps to advertise schools' reputation to everyone, and also gives schoolchildren a great sense of pride about their schools. Ċ On the other hand, it is worth mentioning the disadvantages of wearing this. From the perspective of fashion lovers, it is inconvenient and annoying for them as putting on uniforms seem to be unattractive and not elegant. Besides, wearing uniforms make them less confident whenever they go to school. In addition, another issue is that it affects schools' profiles when badly-behaved students who are wearing uniforms bully, hurt other weaker people in the public areas. This causes detrimental impacts on the success of these schools because parents are reluctant to send their children to schools having these bullying and poorly educated pupils. Ċ In conclusion, although wearing uniforms brings benefits, but this might sadden school children who loves fashion, and have negative consequences for the reputation of schools in some cases."
10462,"As computers translate quickly and easily , learning a foreign language is unnecessary. Discuss both the views and give your opinion ?","It is argued that since the advancement in technology makes translating simple, it is of no use for one to learn a language of another land. I disagree with this because at certain times these devices can be unreliable to depend on. Ċ One plus point of using a computer as a means of learning a foreign tongue is that one can do it without much effort. Instead of memorising and mastering words of the alphabet for the language which a person is learning, computers can store that information effectively and accurately. Take, for example, a language application called John's language that has more than 2000 words of the German language. This application enables its owner to translate any German word into his mother tongue without the need to memorise. Hence, computers do make life easy when it comes to learning. Yet, despite that being the case, I believe it is still not a reliable item. Ċ The disadvantage with using a computer for something as vital as language is that it can not be relied on. To put this in perspective, all the programmes that a computer uses to translate a language is fed into it by humans who are prone to errors. For instance, in a survey conducted on the effectiveness of computers as a language guide, it was determined that due to the fact that it is man-made, it usually broke down and made countless mistakes. Therefore, in order to avoid any problems, it is just necessary for one to learn a foreign language instead. Ċ By way of conclusion, I reaffirm my statement that even though computers may offer the easiest way when it comes to translating, they tend to make too many errors thus proving unreliable. Henceforth, it is always a great idea for a person to learn a new tongue."
10463,The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem? eco-friendly world?,"The increase of consumer goods has brought about a myriad of negative impacts on the natural environment. This essay will present the underlying cause and workable solutions to the problem. Ċ Obviously, there is no denying that overpopulation is the root of the problem. With over 7 billion people around the world, the demands for basic necessities like food, clothes and shelters have been on the inexorable rise. As a result, rainforests have been cleared, especially in developing countries, for industrial, residential and productive land. Factories, which emit harmful gases to the air and toxic wastes to water source, have been opened in every parts of the world to produce various kinds of food, drinks, clothes, etc. This has put unprecedented strains on our finely balanced ecosystem. Ċ In order to solve the problem, both government and individuals should take actions immediately. Firstly, government should put forward a stricter regulation to control the overpopulation issue. Secondly, individuals should adopt a more eco-friendly consumption habits. For example, people should buy biodegradable packaged products, support organic food or avoid overusing plastic bags. Another feasible action is that all industrial and domestic wastes like paper or glass should be sorted out and recycled. By taking all these actions, our living environment would become better and greener. Ċ In conclusion, overpopulation has created undesirable effects on the natural environment. It is the responsibility of both government and people living on the planet to protect it before it is too late."
10464,"Some people think the cheap air flight gives ordinary people more Ċ freedom. However, others think the cheap air flight should be banned Ċ because it pollutes the air and brings many other problems. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion","The question about what cost of air flights is fair in our days is under discussion. A part of people believes that low prices on tickets are giving to average person opportunities to see the world. However, another one supposes that the damage caused to climate change is higher than any possible privileges. I am of the opinion that the affordability of flights should be saved with a strong concern for the environment. Ċ On the one hand, the quantity of air flights has been enormous raised for the last couple of decades. For sure, it becomes the most valuable reason degrading situation with the environment. For instance, carbon footprint. The aeroplane fuel is toxic and taking into account the low number of passengers it makes unsustainable this kind of transport compareChange the form of the verbcomparedIt appears that your sentence or clause uses an incorrect form of the verb compare. Consider changing it. Ċ show examples to, for example, the railway. The increasing cost of tickets could partly solve this problem by decreasing the number of trips. Ċ On the other hand, banning low-cost flights could lead to stagnation of economic development in a lot of touristic countries, such as Italy, Turkey and The United States. A significant part of people will lose their job which could lead to huge social and economical consequences. In addition, the freedom of movement is a basic right of folks. From my point of view, humanity is not ready to give it up. Ċ In conclusion, although we have a certain risk with this frequency of flights I believe that we need to leave the prices at the low rate, but invest more in decreasing the hazards of it."
10465,"Some people believe that the purpose of museums is to entertain, while others argue that museums are built for education. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Some museums tend to focus on entertain, while others are more educative. Personally, I believe that museum can and should synthesis the aspects of entertain and education. Ċ Clearly, a great number of museums, especially the kind of art, attract visitors through some entertain activities. There is no doubt that people have got sufficient theoretical knowledge in the text book and suffer from much pressure in study; therefore, few of them prefer to visit a boring place, just like extra schooling, in leisure time. In this case, providing different activities related to the exhibition, museum is more adorable towards individuals. Ċ However, it offers a chance for people to obtain knowledge in terms of the educative kind of museums. The initial purpose of museum is showing something that visitors did not previously know and expending their outlooks. For instant, teachers will organize students to go to special museum, such as history science and finance museums, for sake of educating students by complemented knowledge. Ċ On balance, the combination of entertain and education can best achieve the main goal of museum. It is unnecessary for people to obtain information mechanically in museum during free time. In other word, museum can attract visitors by building a relaxing atmosphere, a methodology bringing about the same result-enriching people`s knowledge. Moreover, visitors will easier to remember the information related to the activities they experienced in the exhibition. Hence, the combination caters the initial purpose of the museum more successfully, allowing people to obtain knowledge in a more easy way."
10466,Some believe that people will purchase a product based on their needs and advertising is not needed.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Marketing and advertising have always been an integral part of the sales process. While many argue that advertisement serves no real purpose as necessity motivates all purchases, others are of the opinion that advertising has an impact on sales. I agree with the latter view as advertisements offer many other benefits to the manufacturers. Ċ To begin with, it is undeniable that advertising increases profits as it plays a major role in convincing people to buy the advertised product by giving the feeling that life with it can be happier and more comfortable. For example, studies have shown that even if a particular product is widely consumed, using adverts will spur more people to make the purchase, which of course ensure the success of the business. In addition to that, adverts are essential to illustrate the benefits of the product and explain how it functions. Ċ On the other hand, advertising encourages loyalty among customers and increase their trust in the company. This would restrict any competition from other manufacturers who wish to produce similar products. For instance, the engaging and continuous advertising of Pepsi cola has made it the dominating soft drink brand even though several other companies are trying to make a name in this industry. Thus the role of advertising extends beyond providing entertainment. It builds brand value and recognition. Ċ In conclusion, after analysing the previous points, it is clear that promoting products is vital as many positive merits are drawn from this practice. Therefore, it is recommended that all companies launch advertising campaigns that allow their products to reach the widest possible market."
10467,"People buy good products that work, therefore, advertising is unnecessary and is no more than a form of entertainment. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Determining the impact of advertisement is an ongoing debate among consumers. Some advocate the idea that advertising is simply entertainment because almost all customers know which products are efficient. On the other hand, others argue that advertising is still useful to persuade them to buy the goods. I completely disagree with the idea that advertising is not important because it can help the public to know about good items. Ċ First, people always try to make a good purchase. For instance, if someone wants to buy a smartphone, they will opt for a model that has various functions and a cheaper price. However, they may not find a mobile phone that suits their needs if several companies did not advertise to them the other models that they have already developed and produced. Advertisement will be useful in that case because it can deliver some information about functional phones to buyers. Therefore, publishing advertisements play a crucial role in helping purchasers make a better purchase. Ċ Second, consumers not only buy products that they really want but also want to purchase some items that were broadcast on TV. For example, some people want to try alcoholic drinks after seeing their advertisements on TV. To satisfy their curiosity, they purchase the product and find out whether it has excellent quality or not. In this case, advertisements can still influence people to buy products even though they are not certain about their quality. Aside from that, companies continue to make sales and generate profit thanks to such commercials. Ċ To sum up, every person is not only a reasonable consumer but consumes to satisfy their curiosity. Hence, advertisements can deliver information about good items to purchasers who find good products as well as a useful method to draw the interests of consumers."
10468,Nowadays there are many online courses offered by universities. Do you think that the advantages of online learning outweigh the disadvantages?,"In modern times, a lot of distance learning courses are provided by colleges. Although communication is absent in this form of learning, they will gain significant benefits like attending classes from home and also flexibility in timings. In my opinion, students benefit largely from studying online despite the challenges they inevitably face. Ċ Learning in class offers the advantage of clearing doubts in studies related to the particular concepts which the class finds difficult. On the contrary, this is not possible in the case of e-learning which acts as the most crucial demerit. For example, my friend is enrolled for a science diploma programme online and she finds it very challenging to perceive the concepts virtually. Therefore, this type of education is not beneficial at all times as when the queries arise there is no teacher to explain them. Ċ Conversely, offering courses on the internet has several positive points. Firstly, there is no requirement to commute to the institution as classes can be attended from any convenient location and this saves ample time and money. For instance, my colleague is attaining a master's degree in communication technology through means of web learning. Consequently, this assists in saving transportation costs and precious time. Ċ Secondly, Flexibility is a key feature of virtual learning as it allows the pupils to choose any hour of the day to attend the session. Hence, this provides the flexibility to people to work and study as well which is a great advancement in the education field. To illustrate, my husband does a full-time job in the daytime and during the night he does his learning from home. Ċ To conclude, the enormous numbers of courses online given by universities are carrying a lot of plus points for the public. From my perspective, this is the best method of teaching and learning and the benefits of e-classes overshadow its drawbacks. Therefore many people prefer taking classes online."
10469,"Some people view teenage conflict with their parents as a necessary part of growing up, whilst others view it as something negative which should be avoided. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Adolescence is a difficult stage of everyone's lives, thus conflict between parents and teen might happen in the process of growing up. Critics may view this in the negative light, however other assert that it is a part of maturing into adulthood. Ċ The arguments in favour of this would generally based their view that the clash between teenagers and parents is inevitable in the early adulthood stage, This is because teenagers are starting to think independently at this stage, so the conflict of interest with their parents are unavoidable. In the west, this is seen in the positive light - as opposed to the negative view of many Asian cultures. Western culture depict this clashing as a way which teenagers try to 'break free' from their parent's clutch, and their wanting of living independently. Ċ However, there are strong arguments against this view because others perceived that it is rude and insolence toward their parents. Those who hold these views are typically Asian cultures. These cultures practises the submission of teenage to parents as a way of showing respect, and of course, this means no conflicting of interest between both parties. This is because 'conflict' is seen as being rebellious, as opposed to being independent in the Western cultures. Ċ In conclusion, I personally think that teenagers should not be in total submission to their parents as it will kill the trait of thinking independently. Children should communicate closely with their parents and accept their view points as a guideline. Furthermore, if children were isolating themselves within the narrow confines of their age group, it would only limit their view of the world and preventing them from growing up in the best possible way."
10470,"Today, more and more students are deciding to move to a different country for higher studies. Do you think that benefit of this outweighs the problem?","In this present time, a plethora of undergraduates wants to travel in a various country for their higher education. I think its a good and a bad idea for student to graduate from their dream university. Ċ I believe, on one hand, it’s a good idea that youngster wish to proceed their further education in another state. Several nations lack the new way of teaching technology conversely as numerous countries are offering best schooling system to their students with advanced features. For example: Australia offers the better education consequently a number of children wants to graduate from recognized universities which will helps them to get superior job. Moreover, teenager will get chance to learn new language and culture from various background. It will help them to understand the culture differences between the people. Ċ On the other hand, pupil may not wish to go back to their home provincial after finishing their study, as a result, their motherland will lose them. Similarly, to get admission in reputed college is not an easy task. It will take a lot of time and effort. Many people will lose their time if they don’t get visa. For instance: if undergraduates want to continue their schooling in different country then they must go through a long process and their visa might be rejected afterward thence they will behind. Ċ In conclusion, even though it has got is positive and negative side. Teenager should do whatever is best for them and put their best version will doing it."
10471,"Nowadays, a lot of charities and organizations have set up a number of days name the special day to attract people's attention, like National Children's day, National Non-smoking Day. Why do they have to do so, and what will the effects be?","These days, many charities and organizations have created the special day's name, such as National Children's Day and National Non-smoking Day to appeal societies' attention. There are some reasons and impacts of such these special days, which I will explain further in this essay. Ċ There are some purposes, why charities and organizations have set up a special day. Take, National Children's Day for instance, it is a day, that aim to emphasis the societies to take care of children. In fact, quite a few children nowadays become the victim of their family or teacher, such as sexual abuse, human trafficking and so forth. Therefore, with this special day, the charities or organization could give the knowledge to societies regarding the children's right, and how to treat them with well-behaved in order to prevent children abuse. Furthermore, with such these special days, the charities and organizations are able to contribute to the society actively. Thus, for these reasons, the names of special days are created. Ċ In addition, the impacts of these special days could invite the societies to be more pay attentions upon issues occurring these days. Special days campaign that arranged by some organizations and charities about what they fight upon certain issues, will influence people to be better individuals. Non-smoking Day for example, this special day, will enhance people awareness towards the dangerous of smoking to health. Hence, effect of the special days can repair moral values in societies as well. Ċ In conclusion, it is clear that, the name of special days have contributed to societies positively. These special days possess an own purpose as reflected in the day's name itself. With host of special day's name created, it shows that there are still, people in this world that care towards each other."
10472,Television dominates the free-time of too many people. It can make people lazy and prevent them from socialising with others. Ċ Do you agree or disagree?,"Technology has proven to be a blessing in a disguise. Television is one the blessings that initially thought as a source of entertainment has now become the most preferred activity by all the kinds of people to kill their leisure time. Watching television all day-long has made people lethargic and inactive and completely cut off from socialising as well. I agree with notion to a greater extent and will shed some light in following paragraphs. Ċ In today's time, teenagers would like to sit all day long in front of TVs and watch various series or other things.This affects them adversely by making them lazy, not willing to go for outdoor activities where they can actually make some friends and have fun and develop their skills. For instance, earlier they used to play different games which helped them to remain fit and malady free, whereas, today the scenario is completely changed. They sit whole day around, having junk food which leads to many diseases like heart problem, obesity and others. Moreover, they have more of virtual friends rather than real ones upon whom they can relay at the need of the hour. Ċ Adult people are also no less than the younger ones. They too prefer to spend their free time watching serials and other stuff on the electronic machine. They find talking with friends of less interest, rather than watching melodramas of greater joy which results in many issues that they even do not pay attention to. For example, earlier people used to go for a walk after eating which helped them to digest their food and helped them to stay healthy and have a chat with friends around, whereas, today adults like to watch TV even while eating and after that they just lay down without doing any physical activity that can help them to burn their calories and maintain their cholestrol levels. This habit is developed to such an extent that it is difficult for them to leave it. Ċ In a nutshell, Tv has led to the increase of maladies rather than just being a source of joy.Let it be kids, teenagers or adults, no one can care about their health that much which in result leads to weakness, laziness and even socially inactive. This not only affects their health, but also stops them from developing their social skills as well. They should try to limit their timing to watch TV and interact with people around."
10473,"Some people have great ambitions in life, others don't. Do you think ambition is important to succeed in life? Is it a positive or a negative quality to have?","It is true that ambition motivates you to make one's dream true. Although ambition has a dark side of it, I strongly think that ambition is needed for anyone who wanted to excel in their chosen field. Ċ In many situations, ambition is highly regarded. First of all, ambition helps us in self realisation of our own strengths and how better we are in this world. It lays down the path to success in our personal, family and professional lives. An example is Steve Jobs who is ambitious and extra-ordinary visionary who made people to believe Apple products are better than long run rivals in the market. Secondly, it teaches us resilience to overcome the problems in this competitive world. For instance, Japan is the best example to the world which regained its economy after the atom bomb attacks and repeated earth quakes. Finally, being ambitious makes us adaptable and tolerant in a team and by adding more people to one's ambition makes everyone to move forward. Ċ On the other hand, ambition is often associated with greed, intolerance and drive for power. In the movie Wall Street, the character Gordon gecko preaches Greed is good. There is no limit to how much money one can make and how much one can expand the business. Another wrong perspective of ambition is ruthlessness or merciless. It can block human emotions like friendship, respect for others or compassion. Finally, ambition is regarded as individual goal to achieve power, money or fame by paying any price to achieve it. Ċ In conclusion, while ambition may be portrayed negatively by those who failed themselves, it is much needed for life otherwise it would be mechanical or meaningless."
10474,"question: In some country, owning a house rather than renting one is very important for people. Why this may be the case? Do you think this is a negative or positive situation?","Nowadays, people reckon that an adult person should have a home for on their own and that is a pivotal thing in their life. There are some factors to people think which have a considerable effect in their thoughts . Ċ From my perspective, The advantages of possessing an apartment for people are rather significant . Firstly, in Asian culture nations, One of the decisive element of getting married of a man is have a home for theirselves to start up a home .if they have not, it is hard to persuade parent's their wife-future to accept their marriage ,but some people argue that it is not necessary house , it may be true for some others. However , I still believe that owning a flat for a man is easier for them to settle in a new life. Secondly , the day-by-day expenses of living in the big cities as well as rural areas is ridiculously expensive . If an individual get the expenses of paying money to landlord , even it can be a half of their salary. A lack of money can lead to enormous problems in their life. For instance, because of food in the end of months or expense for electricity , they can get into debt as a result. Ċ Nonetheless , there are also the benefits for hiring a accommodation. The renter can move in to anywhere they desire to live or have a trip business in foreign suddenly for a year or more. They will be free to go aboard and work without any ties or hesitation. Ċ In sump up, admittedly, some may struggle to have a apartment for the demand of society and theirselves , having said that. This is no deniable that living in the accommodation can give freedom for them. In my view, this is a positive argument."
10475,Instructions Ċ Read the question below and write an essay dealing with Advantages and Disadvantages.You should spend no more than 40 minutes on this task.Remember to write down a clear thesis statement followed by your essay plan.Only then attempt to write this essay. Ċ Many companies offer their employees the opportunity to work from home.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working from home for the company.And give your own opinion.,"Organization are now allowing their employees to work from home or remotely. Adopting this step is a huge success for every corporate , as this gives more space to its workers to think rationally at their native place. As every idea has its own advantages and disadvantages which I will discuss in below paragraphs. Ċ Firstly, As technology has reached in every nook and corner of the world, its helping organization to adapting working from home and with flexible timings. This gives employees to balance their work-life , as there is no commute time involved. For example, due to urbanization affording a place in downtown or city would cost more rather on the countryside , so public travel to reach their office for at least 1-2 hours and often getting tired due to tight schedules and this leads to giving less time to the family. To add further, eating fresh food at lunch and preferring fruits over junk which is easily available in the office. These are the main points which are certainly giving an edge to working from home. Ċ However , there are negative points as well to this idea such as the public is not getting connected socially. For example, when in office team goes for lunch together, or have fun activities in breaks while these are getting limited. In case accommodation is smaller, sometimes it’s tough to adjust. Most importantly, people don’t have a track of time and end up working more than usual hours. Ċ To conclude, in my opinion working from home should be given, but it should be restricted for the number of hours on a monthly or annually basis. Also , I believe every company should be ready for giving its employee this opportunity as its proving to be good in case of a pandemic situation."
10476,Some people point out that there will be less international travel in the future. Do you think it is a positive or negative trend? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.(can you give individual scores based on criteria?),"Cross-country travelling is quite debatable topic and many people believes that in the upcoming future international travel will become less over the period of time. So, it needs to ascertain whether it would be positive or negative sign for a nation. Well, I am of the both view that it would be positive trend as well as negative trend. Ċ First of all, if inter-country travelling will be less in the near future then it is beneficial for a country as it will help in saving the outflow of domestic currency to other nation. For example, if people go for holiday trip internationally then they end up spending handsome amount on adventure activities, souvenirs etcetera, so it is an indirect loss for the native country to which travellers belong. Moreover, persons who travel abroad much frequently become habitual to adopt the culture of destination country which is not at all good for a nation since it will start losing their culture values gradually. Ċ On the other hand, tourism industry plays a vital role in uplifting the economy. Any country will be able to earn major chunk of income through tourism sector, therefore, if foreigners people will not visit internationally then a country will not be able to earn foreign exchange. Various researches have shown that federal government earns humongous amount of revenue in the form of taxes through international tourism. Furthermore, many sectors which are directly associated with the tourism will have drastic impact on their growth i.e. hospitality sector, entertainment zones etc. Ċ To sum up, I understand that international tourism is integral for a nation by which we can maintain the good relationship with other country and can earn revenue but we should not forget the cultural values of one's own country by visiting other nation."
10477,Some people argue that space exploration has had more to do with national pride than national effort. To what extent do you agree with this? How do you think space exploration will change in the future?,"In the globalisation era, the development of technology has spread in all aspects. One of them is in the space exploration. Some people believe that with this mission, it can make a nation proud of. Because of that, this needs great effort to prove it. In my view, I strongly agree that in the next future a space journey become prominent. Ċ Furthermore, the inhabitants who know the technology. They will search novel methods to break the limit. As example, a new discovery of space travelling to the moon which done in July 21, 1969 by three Americans. This is proved that the USA has an immense ambitions of special purpose. From that moment, the USA had been a superpower country since it showed the different performance and become fame state. Ċ Nevertheless, all that inseparable from the country which included in the project. Aerospace organizations contains people all over the world. On account of this, Americas cannot claim that they commit their experiments clearly base on their struggle. In addition, regarding the financial aspects, this project needs much cost and requires loan of money from other countries. The nations which helped this invention should be appreciated and become famous as well. Ċ For several years later, in my point of view the travelling of outer space is predicted become the extraordinary one because until present, solely few of inhabitants who can go there. For instance, only 3 Americans, namely Niel Amstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins in 1969 then, this was followed by Russia in 4 years later. This is because for this project requires high financial and much time for preparation. Ċ The aforementioned evidence reveals that although space exploration is difficult journey for people now, the scientists continually make an endeavour to achieve a life in outer space. Then, in next several decades, the era is predicted to face outer travelling."
10478,Homeschooling is becoming increasingly popular as more and more parents are choosing to educate their children in this way. why do you think parents might chose homeschooling rather than traditional schools. Do you think homeschooling is more beneficial?,"Parents nowadays believed that homeschooling is better rather than traditional schools. It is becoming more popular among them. As the generational change, the situations and the requirements change, so as it happens with schooling system. However, as per my view traditional school system is still better than taking classes from their premises. There are various reasons for adopting the private tuitions by the parents that I will discuss in below paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, the concept of accepting the homeschooling by the parents, is the convenience for them of not wasting their hours or more in pick and drop of children from the campus. For instance, As per current scenario, both mother and father are working and they both have to go to an office. At the same moment, they need to get their children ready in the morning and drop them to school. Therefore, the process took a long time for them. But if they prefer private tuitions for their children, then they can spend their time by doing other work. Another reason is the low expenses have to pay for it. Because there are many facilities that schools are not liable to charge if parents are adopting for home tuition. Due to above reason it is becoming popular among parents. Ċ To continue with my views on schooling system, There are lots of things that children may miss in homeschooling. For example, Without attending school, they do not get a chance to interact with other children. Moreover, it teaches children the values, respect, manners interact with others. Further, they learn the values like to get up early and get ready to reach there on time. Other than these, it provides a playground where they can play with their friends and stay connected. Whereas, in homeschooling the children will get rid of these facilities. Consequently, the traditional systems is must for child growth and development. Ċ To conclude, there is no doubt that home tuition gives relaxation to both children and parents. On the other side, it makes them stay flat from other facilities that are essential for child development."
10479,"Nowadays, the use of animal testing in medical research has become a hot topic. Some people believe that animal testing should be banned, whereas others claim it is necessary. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Some individuals commented that the use of fauna in the medicinal investigation should be abolished. However, others argue that it is crucial and scientists should continue. Personally, I advocate the second view opposing to the first since the research analysis benefits all. Although it is against the fauna protection rules. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide evidence to prove the argument. Ċ On the one hand, the animals' used in pharmaceutical experimentation produced reliable results. In other words, this sort of research has shown robust information in the past, thus, it is vital their application today. For instance, the coronavirus vaccine was initially tested in monkeys, once the wild species body has a similar functioning mechanism to human beings, and the antibiotic was produced in a record period of time. As a result, trustworthy and appropriate medicine is made. Furthermore, it is the overriding reason for pharmaceutical field development these days. Ċ On the other hand, the utilization of zoos goes against protectionism laws. Because of the necessity to safeguard terrestrial or marine species, there is a misalignment between the environmental activists and the medical researchers making their dispute over whether it is the right or bad thing to use guinea pigs for example. Hence, there are one-side communities that are critical and others are in favour. Moreover, the therapeutical use of wildlife is pointed out as the prime reason for heated debates nowadays. Ċ In conclusion, notwithstanding some critical ideas concerning the utilization of zoos into scientific overhaul, it is pivotal to continue the saga because it results in extremely advantageous scoops not only for supporters of the ideas but for every individual. Therefore, I still advocate the animal application."
10480,The advantages of English spreading as a global language will continue overweight the disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree? the global communication tool,"Nowadays, learning English is one of the most popular practices among Young people. Some people hold the opinion that English should be the language every people must speak. With the fast increase of this language use in the world, seems obvious that its benefits overweight the drawbacks. From my perspective, this idea is not completely accurate owing to the consequences this could have for society. Ċ On the positive side, the implement of English as the global language for fields such as business, university studies, research, and science has improved the communication and exchange of information. Scientists from all over the world are publishing their studies and papers in English and thus their research are reaching most people around the globe. Trade transactions among executives from different lands have been empowered by the Shakespeare language settled as the primary language in this sector. Ċ On the other hand, this positioning of English as the number one peaking language these days has significant consequences for several professions. Foreign language professional for instance French, Spanish, Korean or Chinese teachers will become rare as well as foreign language studies will lose relevance in the future, narrowing the variety of university programs. In addition, diversity among countries will be affected by this one-language trend. Non-English-speaker nations will be forced to switch languages and will lose their identity in language matters. Ċ To conclude, despite the fact that English as a global language is constantly increasing due to the advantages of this tendency, the negative side should not be dismiss. An appropriate balance between both sides could be the proper approach to deal with this phenomenon."
10481,"Do you agree or disagree with the sentence: In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today? Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.","The human transportation always changes with the development of society. In another words, the useless or old vehicles will be replaced by new ones when time go by. Therefore I have several reasons to agree that the car-using will decrease in the future and it will the focus on my essay. Ċ First, one of the reason make car-using declines is it has negative impact on environment. The energy which supports car machine comes from the burning fuel and diezen oil which creates a lot of harmful gases. Those gases cause air pollution and greenhouse effect. Moreover, it also creates a lot of serious diseases for the healthy of human. Therefore, it is necessary to supersede car by another vehicles which does not create negative effect for environment in the future. Ċ Secondly, with the development of new material in the next decades, the scientists will create more modern vehicles like airplane and electronic cars-it makes the use of car will decrease. New type of vehicles will be more convenient and safer. For example, airplane is the type of transport which is faster and safer than car. People can go through a long distance within few hours by airplane while car will take few days or few weeks. Moreover, new transport will helps people save time and money. Thus, the use of new vehicles will make the consumer of car reduce rapidly in the future. Ċ In summary, although some people still believe in the important role of car today, I still believe that the disadvantages of this transport outweigh the advantages. In fact, with the growth of science and technology, people can create more type of transport which is better and helpful than car."
10482,The education of young people is the main priority in countries around the world. Some people believe that educating adults who cannot read or write is essential for the society and more funding should be made available for it. Do you agree or disagree?,"Many argue that countries must prioritize mainly the education of children. However, others opine to have societies start funding illiterate adults to learn. I agree with the view and, this essay will explain the reasons for adult schooling. Ċ Firstly, when a person struggles with reading or writing, social impacts are profound. Over a while, they develop low self-esteem, feel emotions such as shame and fear. For example, being illiterate, the individual would avoid situations where they have to communicate and make decisions. Secondly, unlearned adults are more susceptible to live destitutely. In developing countries, people living in poverty are either unemployed or work in low-skilled jobs. As a result of unemployment and to make ends meet, children are sent to work, while others get involved in theft and other crimes. With the funds, they can study in vocational training schools to develop skills to earn a decent living; and literacy training which raises reading proficiency. Ċ Lastly, uneducated individuals are prone to health issues. Due to the fact, they have trouble reading and understanding safety protocols, tend to have more workplace accidents and prolonged recovery period. Crucial information like the inability to read prescription labels and drug overdose is more common among these people. We can ask them to repeat instructions and assess their baseline information about their health before proceeding further. Ċ In conclusion, I reiterate that it is immensely vital for adults to be literate in today's society and, we must take urgent measures and invest more to educate these adults."
10483,".People these days watch TV, films and other programmes alone rather than with other people. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","It has been pointed out that people have been becoming to watch TV series or movies solely. Personally, I opine that this situation brings out several dangerous problems in terms of personal skills and health issues compared to one benefit it might bring. Ċ Admittedly, watching TV shows alone increases individuals’ quality of life. This is because TV-watchers are able to appreciate the content regarding their interests and hobbies instead of considering their companions’ thoughts, thus contributing more convenience and ease to their lives. For instance, a vast majority of housewives say that they had to watch sports games that they did not interest in with their husbands previously. However, due to their lifestyle changing nowadays, they can binge on dramas that are their favourite shows, which leads to freedom and flexibility for them. Ċ Nevertheless, despite the benefit above, I believe that individuals are facing a huge number of dangerous detriments from watching multimedia alone. The reason is that communicating with their relatives and friends while watching movies provides people with chances to improve their social skills and enhance their sense of belongs. By contrast, as those who watch TV shows alone are less likely to have a considerable amount of time to talk about with their friends and family members, they may lack intimacy and connection and feel lonely, thus raising devastating emotional and mental problems and impairing their communication skills. As an illustration, most office-workers living alone and watching multimedia sole state that they are suffering from serious emotional issues nowadays since fewer people they can interact with while they watch TV shows. They also feel that their social skills are no longer strong. Ċ In conclusion, although binge on TV programmes alone has one minor advantage, a massive proportion of obvious drawbacks with regard to social skills and health problems should be taken into account."
10484,Better driver education for better driving habits is more effective than heavier punishments for driving offenses. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, as you know that social development leads to the demand for transport is increasing. Consequently, there are many transportations which run on the road escalate more frequent traffic accidents. It was suggested that the education of people using vehicles is better than punishment, but in my opinion, I suppose that is unreasonable. Simultaneously, I also give some of my own explanations for this essay. Ċ As we know, accidents involving vehicles are happening all over the world today and the extent of these accidents is from mild to severe and can be related to human life. Therefore, it's better to have very serious penalties with the target is a deterrent for drivers to avert catastrophic accidents. For example: In developed countries, if drivers violate traffic rules, besides compensation for damage, they could lose their job and could be gone to jail. So, it is necessary to educate carefully before granting diplomas for people such as increasing the difficulty in handling the real situation. Ċ Although better driving behaviour education is what we should do, it is not the best enough method to minimize the number of people get injured in transportations. At that time, the driver will no longer fear fines and accidents can occur at any time. In addition, learning primarily depends on the human factor, so it will not be objective. For instance: a person may obtain an excellent driver's license, but being distracted can cause a problem. So, besides increasing the level of sanction, we also improve the quality of training to ensure safety for participants. Ċ In conclusion, I think that sanctions are still one of the most effective solutions to reduce traffic accidents and it has been proven all over the world."
10485,Global environmental issues are the responsibility of rich nations not of poorer nations. Do you agree with this opinion.,"Depletion of the environment has become a grave issue for the whole world. Many people think that only rich countries should take up the responsibility to work for conserving the habitat. However, I do not agree with this approach and find it as an absurd solution. Ċ To commence with, richer countries can take up this responsibility because they have the resources. Firstly, developed countries has much more knowledge because they have multiple scientists and researchers working in the newer areas of study. Thus, there are greater chances for them to find substitutes of existing resources to produce energy. Secondly, the developed countries have the financial resources to fund the establishments of projects for energy production with lesser harm to the environment. For example, the USA has spent a great deal of money on the projects to extract solar and nuclear energy. Such projects have reduced their dependency on coal for power. Ċ On the other hand, the underdeveloped nations do not have enough resources. They want their manufacturing industry to bloom and hence, they concentrate only on the their economy without any consideration of environmental damage. But, this way they will end up nullifying all the efforts put by the richer countries to conserve the habitat. Therefore, it is necessary for them to take some steps as well. For instance, they can create an awareness about the importance of preservation of the surroundings, so that their citizens can contribute as well. India has started giving subsidy on the installation of solar panels for meeting the electricity needs. Ċ To conclude, in my opinion, the protection of the environment is the dual responsibility of both richer and poorer countries. Even if the poorer nations might not be able to contribute financially like richer ones, but they can spread awareness among its citizens to take some small steps."

10487,"At present we rely on oil for most our energy needs. However, oil is a fossil fuel and causes air pollution, and it will eventually run out. Nuclear energy is the only practical and clean source of energy for the world. In what extent do you agree and disagree?","The world now have recently faced serious air pollution and power shortage. The statistics shows that fossil fuel such as gas and oil is reaching the exhausted peak. It is argued that nuclear power is the most feasible alternative source which can solve pollution issue. However, I strongly disagree with this view. Ċ First of all, although nuclear energy can deal with the exhaustion, lots of great dangers lie behind this source due to the fear of contamination. Statistic illustrates that the number of disasters which are caused by radioactive waste in the recent decades is not small. Take for example, the latest disaster Fukusima. The whole large area was severely contaminated; as a result, the citizens were completely moved to another place. This raises the question of the safety of nuclear power. Ċ Then what are the alternative forms that are more comparative? Many other sources of energy such as solar and windy as well as biofuels power are possibly potential to exploit in the near future. Despite relatively large setup costs, these source are evidently proved to be cost-effective and sustainable in the long run. In addition, as they are definitely endless, we never mind that one day they will ultimately exhaust. These source can also solve the environmental issue which is the biggest drawback of the nuclear power. Ċ The facts outlined above, when taken together, are in the favor of the view that nuclear is not the future energy alternative. The question is now whether government policies is strict enough in order to encourage power companies to invest more in new sources of energy."
10488,"Some people say that children with different abilities should be taught in different classes at school; other; however , think that streaming education has more disadvantages than advantages, and that all children should be taught in one and same class.  Discuss both of the views. which do you support? give reason for your answer.","A much debated issue these days is whether youngster with assorted capacities ought to be educated in dissimilar level at school. Many people are of the opinion that we should implement this, while some opposite opinion suppose distinctive classes bring more drawback. This essay will analyse both pros and cons of this idea. Ċ First of all, classifying dissimilar students to suitable environment can help talented students who always want to prove themselves have chance to develop more quickly. Indeed, with favorable programme, they can abridge the time need to complete every grade. Not only that, these classes also support students have lower capacity. When teacher have adequate time to care them, they will not feel inferior, as study with superior others., Besides, owing to categorize level of students, educators have more opportunites. What appropriate syllabus and agenda for their class may enhance aptitude for white-collar youngster. Ċ However , specialized education also bring a lot of fault . The fight for justice and democracy in class is an essential prerequisite for youngsters. But, if streaming classes are enforced , this may be difficult to implemented . Beyond , less intelligent children do not have chance to interact with smarter partner. In young generation, exchange relations between pupils have reversed level are really crucial . Evidently, this education system will make to increase self-conceited and self-abased children. Ċ From all things considered, although a great many people hold firm to their beliefs that we need to eliminate specialized education , I am convinced that this is very necessary for us, especially, in changeable world today."
10489,Some young children spend a great amount of their time practicing sports. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"there are a lot of young children how practice sport. Some of them practice the sport they love such soccer or basketball, others practice the sport that their parents have obliged them to. Whatever the reasons for what the young children practice sport, practicing sport has some advantages and disadvantages. Ċ Sport is one of the most important thing that help young children to stay healthy. By practicing sport young people can stay far from being obese which lead forward to some diseases such as heart disease or diabetes. Also ,it is well known that sport release pressure from the young children who attend daily their schools. So they can spend their free time in practicing sport to have some pleasure and fun. Another advantage of practicing sport by young children is that sport teaches them how to face their fear. This skill will be useful for them to solve their problems and issues with brave and responsibility. Ċ On the other hand , spending much time in practicing sport by young children has other consequences that can negatively affect the entire life of the young child. The child at this age can be influenced a lot by the sport. Thus, the sport will divert them from focusing in their studies. Also, when children spend much of their time in practicing sport, it leads to be less sociable. They will miss the opportunity to share some time with their families or their friends. Progressively, they will lonely and lose contact with people. Ċ It is good and important that young children practice sport , but it will be dangerous for them if they become possessed by it. The right thing is to give each thing the adequate time."
10490,"Some people like to try new new things, for example, places to visit and types of food. Other people prefer to keep doing things they are familiar with. Discuss both these attitudes and give your opinion.","Some individuals have their own interests and there has always been a debate around the globe that whether or not should try out new things. It is often believed that many people prefer to explore new places and new food. However, others argue that the things that are known are always a better option. In my opinion, I believe that people should explore as much as they can. Ċ On the one hand, the ideas that are already familiar, a person becomes an expert. Firstly, doing the same thing over a period of time results in getting expertise that has certain benefits. For instance, most of the developed nations, tend to offer higher compensation to the employees who are the experts. Moreover, many people get comfortable with the situation and become tasteless to try new sorts of ideas such as places, cuisines. In other words, many individuals never desire to get out of their comfort zone as they fear that it will require a lot of hardships. Ċ On the other hand, although many citizens globally are exhilarated to explore something new. To illustrate, they figure out the ample number of opportunities to know about the different cuisine, taste and lifestyles when they plan to visit new locations. For example, in a recent survey, it was reported that 50% of the tourists were highly satisfied with their experience when they explored a new country and new restaurants. Furthermore, trying out various things may turn out to be a great source for finding out someone's passion. It is considered by many that they found their true passion while exploring multiple tastes. Ċ In conclusion, although following the same conventional way insists on mastering that skill, being flexible to accept new ideas has numerous benefits such as enhancing their preferable knowledge about the cuisines and finding their own passion."
10491,Fewer and fewer people walk on a daily basis. What are the reasons and how to encourage them to spend their time walking?,"People’s tendency in walking regularly is decreasing. There are a few reasons for this, but particular solutions can be taken to tackle this problem. Ċ There are several causes for this trend. Firstly, modern life has brought many pressures in daily schedules, and people are up to their neck in work. When individuals do not have enough time, instead of walking they have to choose vehicles such as cars to go to their workplace or other destinations. Secondly, Doing the same activity on a regular basis could be boring. Take the case of employees, who have to walk to their offices through the same streets every day without any novelty or company. Ċ Nevertheless, various possible actions could be taken to address the above. In the first place, the government should set new laws for employers to postpone the starting time of workplaces. This increase the free time of people, which encourage them to consider walking as an alternative way to go to work. Additionally, popular companies like Nike could create international mobile applications in order to encourage people to walk more. These companies can investigate the individual reasons why many people do not choose to walk in order to design useful Apps with the purpose of making walking easier for them. For example, an App can be beneficial for individuals who do not like walk alone to connect and match them to another person to walk with. Ċ In conclusion, various factors have led to a decrease in people who walk daily, but this could be tackled by possible solutions."
10492,"Topic: Today, there are many books to read. In your opinion, what kinds of books should we read?","Books are one of the best tools to help people approach the world. Nowadays, many books are established, it leads to difficult for readers to choose. The issue of whether choosing books has been debated widely. Personally, I think there are two kinds of books we should read: Science books and Skill books. Ċ There are positive reasons for reading science books and skill books. First of all, science books provide us general knowledge about not only natural but also artificial phenomenons on the World. For instance, science books can help mankind understand water cycle, the essence of disasters such as vocalno, storm and so forth or it gives us the information about how to make clay, vihicles. Therefore, human being can understand clearly essence of each appearance which very helpful for them to avoid bad things or develop their life. Ċ The second kind of book we should read is skill books. Skill books have many types such as: living skills, business skills etc. All of them are likely alternative programs for people who don't have enough time to take part in skill courses. Thanks for skill books, people know how to live, communicate and deal with problems more. Take for example, the book ""How to win friends and influence people"" help readers to perfect themselves and get more love and respect from the others. One more example is the book ""Diffentiate or Die"" which decribes many strategy to get success in business. As can be seen clearly from those examples, skill books help people live effectively. Ċ In conclusion, there are many advantages that science books and skill books bring to us. Let's read them in negative way to improve and perfect ourselves."
10493,"When students move to a new school, they sometimes face problems. How can schools help these students with their problems?","Students who move to a new school often confront with many problems; it is very important for them to get accustomed as soon as possible. Some students find it really easy; however, others' adaptation is not as good as their friends'. Consequently, schools should help them come through this experience successfully. Ċ To begin with, in the first weeks, schools should give some orientation course which help freshman get involved with new environment. Advisors or administrators should take them on a tour of school and show them around should. Advisors should tell them about the school' history, how to access facilities in the school such as gyms, library, access computer, carteen, the rule they have to follow, and so on. Ċ Besides, schools should help them find accommodation. Most new students wonder that whether they should live in hostel or rent a flat outside the school campus; therefore, School advisors can show the both advantages and disadvantages of these kinds of accommodation. School should arrange place in campus area for students who want to live in school, and help others who prefer living outside school to find place for living. Ċ Last but not least, schools should constitute clubs, outside activities to make a good environment for students participate. When these students attend, they have more chance to make friend with others. Ċ To sum up, the role of school is very important to help new students get accustomed to new environment."
10494,"Some parents are worried about the increasing level of violence in tv, video games and other type of entertainment for children's leisure. How does this effect children? How do you think problem can be tackles?","Nowadays, children's recreational activities likewise gaming and television are influencing roughness on the child's behaviour while certain parents are disturbed with the increment on savage entertainment. In my perception, leisure activities are vital in the early childhood despite the parental control is obvious. Ċ On the one hand, there are positive and negative effects on modern recreational. To illustrate, television programs like Discovery Science and Animal planet nourish the knowledge, but adult movies and wrestling reacts in contrast. Also video games help to keep the young's occupied and improve their thinking speed. Besides children can get addicted to this activity, resulting with hyper behaviour problems and lack of interest in studies.To put it simply, electronic recreational activities have some benefits with parental guidance. Ċ On the other hand, thoughtful eliminating methods to tackle the flawless creations of recreational's incline with parental and necessary legal restrictions, indeed. Particular TV channels, suitable for children's would stop them going through adult or violent materials. In addition, a mobile application where parents can intrude into program history or restrict unsuitable programs. At the same moment, merging video games with the mobile phones will help to control the gaming time and stop violent games from playing. In a word, sheer parenting on children should be present at any moment. Ċ In conclusion, fathers and mothers have become very busy in their career development for the financial incentives. Despite than children being neglected by parents should allocate some time for their kid's physical activities like involving them in sports and athletics."
10495,"Traditional schooling is out of date, boring and stifles a child’s natural talents, various professionals have pushed for an education revolution. Are there alternatives in the education system? Is traditional education doing more harm than good?","The conventional rote method of learning is often considered to be so dull as to discourage the full development of young people’s innate abilities. This essay agrees with the view that the current pedagogy is outdated, and will consider an alternative to traditional schooling. Ċ While ordinarily, adolescents are expected to retain pre-approved information dictated by a teacher, a self-directed approach can be more beneficial. In spite of the fact that holding all juveniles to the same standard will necessarily have a divisive result, with some offspring believing themselves to be intellectually superior, and others feeling inadequate, perhaps for life.Moreover, in systems in which achievement is relative, such as in Finland for example, young people graduate from discipline each feeling as if they have completed their own unique path, and knowing deeply and without ,prejudice their own capabilities, reducing or even eliminating the feelings of inequality that conventional learning creates. Ċ Furthermore, under the current system, students who lack aptitude in core subjects such as mathematics and the sciences are seen as having less intrinsic value to society. These youngsters not only spend their lives believing that they are inadequate, but also many may have valuable talents that were never explored. It is in the only way that conventional literacy does the most harm, by ignoring niche abilities in favour of skills with more mass appeal. In contrast to the traditional training with the Finnish system of self-direction, we can see that the former is certainly causing harm to a significant number of pupils. Ċ To conclude, changes are urgently required in education systems around the world. We should focus more on a child’s interests and innate abilities in order to maintain their engagement, and allow them to direct their own learning to achieve the best outcomes."
10496,Today many children spend a lot of time playing computer games and little time on sports. Why is it? Is it a positive or negative development?,"One of the most conspicuous trends in today's world is teenagers playing video games instead of playing in the outdoors. Many parents are worried with the decline in daily exercise and cognitive skills. As such, there are both merits and demerits for this trend, this essay will explain the drawbacks of this development and explain them in detail. Ċ Firstly, students have a lot of leisure time and playing interactive computer games can kill the boredom. In addition, youngsters have the tendency to accept the challenge and break personal records and this is the major reason for virtual gaming addiction. For instance, a recent survey suggests that to gain instant fame and easy money console games is the easiest option available. Needless to say, to challenge opponents and to create personal records without physical stain are the reasons for gaming addiction. Ċ Secondly, there are some pitfalls that can overwhelm the potential benefits of this trend. Most of the parent's are worried about their children's decline in daily physical activities and social cognitive abilities. Moreover, virtual reality has been taken over by augmented reality and every individual, enjoys the virtual gaming more interactive compared to the physical games. For example, console games like Xbox and PlayStation increasing in demand after introducing virtual games. Hence, young students are more attracted to console games and enjoy the creativity of designing their own games and rules. Ċ In conclusion, one can clearly understand that innovations in gaming have gone from reality to Virtuality and this leads to decline in socializing skills in peer school goers. Finally, the role of virtual reality is too dire to ignore in this trend."
10497,Topics: Some people say university students should pay for their tuition fees. Some others say the government should pay for the tuition fees. What is your opinion?,"In the long history of human education, there exists a long-term discussion about the tuition fees. Some people hold that university students should pay for their tuition fees, while others think that tuition fees should be afforded by the government. Both of their opinions make sense in some degree. However, I prefer share the former one which can be held by certain raisons. Ċ In the first place, we have to admit that paying tuition fees by government would be beneficial to the public. However, it puts, at the same time, heavy financial burden on the government. The government has already paid for the expenses of the infrastructure building and public welfare. Moreover, all of which have cost huge amount of money. So affording tuition fees will cut other budgets down, because the amount of money is stable. Ċ Secondly, although, at present, the government does not spend money on tuition fee, it has already taken some effective actions to solve the financial problems of students from poor families, such as scholarship and educational loan. So students should pay for their tuition fees in order to share responsibility for the public education and to diminish government's burden. Ċ Last but not the least, if students pay their tuition fees, they will do some part-time jobs to earn money and therefor enhance their awareness of finance and practice their ability. Furthermore, university students, above 18 years old, have been adults, should take bills for their own behaviors. And this measure would let them know how precious money is and cherish the opportunity of attending university. Ċ To sum up, I believe that students should pay for their tuition fees, which alleviate the government's financial pressure and strength students' financial awareness."
10498,"All over the world, societies are facing a growing problem with obesity. This problem affects both children and adults. What are the reasons for this rise in obesity. How could it be tackled.","Since the last few decades, the severe health problems are escalating in the certain demographics of a society. It is, therefore, the obesity has become a major concern in the people of all age groups. This essay will discuss the root causes of the condition, including sedentary lifestyle and poor diet along with tha,t some preventive measures will also be mentioned to mitigate the effects. Ċ It is seen that these days people are working longer than ever and due to their working conditions they have very little time for themselves which ultimately drag them towards the detrimental condition of putting on weight. As a result, presistent health issues arises. Moreover, unbalanced diet and the exorbitant consumption of ready-to-eat meal is contributing to make the people obese simultaneously as due to their hectic schedule, people tend to choose frozen food over the home cooked food. For instance, there have been some recorded instaces of people, who are gaining their weight due to prolonged sitting and unhealthy meals. Thus, above-mentioned are some factors which are causes of making people fatty. Ċ There are some potential ways which could be adopted to solve the rising problem such as work life balance and improvement in one's diet. If the people enable themselves to maintain a strategies to keep the balanced between their personal life and workplace environment, then at a large extent their health will be sustainable. Furthermore, to eat the nutritious food with less calories could be improved the overall health of an individual and the issue of obesity will be alleviate eventually. For example, according to one research article, in Japan 70% of the total population is in the trend of fittness as they are quite health conscious. Overall, the solutions could progressively work in a long term. Ċ To conclude, the vast majority of people are adversely affected by diseases and to put on weight is one of them, which is common in people of all stages of life. The essay has discussed the reasons behind it and the solutions of the problem are twofold: the stability in professional and personal life, and to change the dietery pattern."
10499,Some people think that dangerous sport should be banned while others believe that people should be free to choose.Discuss both views and give your opinion,"It is thought by certain individuals that the sporting activities which have danger involved should be abandoned and I also endorse the aforementioned statement while others believe they should have the freedom to make their own choice. Both sides will be discussed in the essay below with the relevant examples. Ċ To begin with, some hold a view that ban should be imposed on the sports that are dangerous as when people try their hands on these activities, they might not be aware of the risk involved, hence, making themselves land in problems that might be harmful to their lives. For example, while performing scuba diving if the pressure below the sea-bed increases and the person is not able to withstand that then, he/she may fall for the situation of bends along with some respiratory issues. Moreover, there are times when all cautious measures are taken in order to avoid any mishappenings but uncertain circumstances such as bad weather or sudden currents in the water during a water-sport can bring worse conditions of breathlessness, increased heart rate and much more in the above cases. Ċ However, it is felt by few individuals that they should have the freedom to make a decision about the sporting activities that they want to perform as various personalities believe in trying things out of their zone of comfort and bestow themselves the chance to challenge themselves. For instance, one acquaintance of mine wished to fly in the hot air balloon from a slanted cliff of a mountain which was considered unsafe but he wanted to test himself and experience it. Furthermore, it is believed by a part of the population that these kinds of sports help in imbibe fearlessness in themselves, therefore, they should not be devoid to choose them, an example of it is my own getting away from the fear of height when I did paragliding. Ċ In a nutshell, In my and some people' viewpoint, the sporting activities that are dangerous should be stopped by banning them as they might be risky to the life of many individuals, nevertheless, others feel they should be free to make their own choice as they are the best evaluators of what they wish to try in their lives."
10500,Young people are often influenced by their peers. This is called peer group Ċ pressure. Ċ Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"In our society, people face peer pressure which means that children are influenced by their friends, who are of the same ages. Generally, it has both positive points and negative aspects simultaneously, while I believe that the advantages are more than drawbacks. Ċ The two main positive aspects of being impressed by their friends are learning new skills and trying to acquire a high level of software skills. That is to say, young generations have passion about their life; moreover, they learn a plethora of skills namely various languages, and sports if they have a communication with other students regularly. For instance, when adult students are interested in sport including football, the younger students are being influenced by them. As a result, they make a suitable curriculum to engage in sports constantly. On the other hand, because of acceleration in using of technology every person should improve their digital knowledge, therefore pupils will be impressed by the adolescence if they are sophisticate in technology. For example, in 2019, it was reported that the number of students, who had a tendency to learn a diversity of software increased in the US. Ċ However, there are some disadvantages when it comes to getting impact. Firstly, there is a number of students with different attitudes. As a consequence, pupils can learn hazardous skills from them. For instance, if one of them smokes, the pupils will appeal to them easily, and it can be harmful to both individuals and the school’s community. Secondly, the demand for new facilities will be increased, thus they put their parents into trouble. Ċ In my opinion, by guiding students, they can learn how to control themselves from their peer's temptations, and gain a positive result from them to reform their lives in a correct way. To sum up, all students have confronted this issue during their life. If their parents had taken appropriate schedules, they would encourage them to learn the benefits of this subject."
10501,Obesity is an increasing public health problem in some parts of the world. Explain some possible reasons for this problems and suggest some solutions,"An upward trend is seen in public health due to fatness This essay will discuss the possible reasons for obesity, including lack of exercising and stress-eating due to work or personal problems. Fortunately, although these issues have led to a rise in corpulence, there are ways we can solve this problem, including gaining an active lifestyle and adopting stress management techniques. Ċ People are working more hours than before nowadays, which leaves them with a very little amount of time for personal development activities. In addition, this work pressure leads to stress-eating in some people. People place themselves under such unfavourable environments because it is a competitive domain. People are not aware of what they are eating in these stressful hours. For instance, A recent study found that people in the USA have stressful jobs that lead to eating junk food and stress-related sicknesses. This often results in people getting fat because of the stress and the lack of time to exercise. Ċ Maintaining a stress-free life and improving one's attitude towards exercising are both critical to mitigating heftiness problems. People need to adapt to a healthy lifestyle and exercise regularly as a routine. For example, Recent research concluded that people that exercise daily and have a healthy diet do not suffer from being heavy. Ċ In conclusion, people are increasingly suffering from obesity. This essay not only discussed how obesity is caused by the absence of exercises and thereby a bad diet, but also suggested that the solutions to these problems are twofold- to maintain a good and healthy diet and to work out daily."
10502,"IELTS WRITING TASK 2. ESSAY THROW-AWAY SOCIETY Many people say that we have developed into a ""throw-away society"" because we are filling up our environment with so many plastic bags and rubbish that we cannot fully dispose of. To want a degree do you agree with this opinion?","It is argued that humans have been in a ""throw-away"" lifestyle. And it's become worst as we have been dumping a large amount of non-biodegradable rubbish. I find myself in complete agreement with this opinion for the following reasons. Ċ To begin with, there was a dramatic increase in the use of plastic bags. Those which are non-biodegradable will have existed a thousand years in our habitat. Therefore, a long time later, humans and other species will not have abode. More specifically, plants can not grow up with a large amount of plastic under the land. Ċ Furthermore, according to the nearest environment research in a reputable university, the number of garbage climbed exponentially including domestic, industrial, and medical waste. This situation makes an urgent issue for human society that effective and timely solutions to dispose of them. If not, it will become the main culprit of increasing environmental problems. For instance, many residential areas have been polluted air and water because their living locations are near a huge landfill. Ċ That is not to say that plastic bags just bring disadvantages to human life. People tend on single-use or disposable plastic because they believe that these items are cheaper, more convenient, and hygienic. However, the drawbacks of them causes are far greater. Ċ In conclusion, I would concur with those who believe that human effect leads to creating a ""throw-away society"" by filling up our habitat with so many plastic bags and garbage that we are not able to process all."
10503,"Topic: in many countries, good schools and medical facilities are available only in cities. Some people think that university graduates who become new teachers and doctors should work in rural areas for a few years. To what extend do you agree or disagree?","The issue of whether students who majored in education or medicine should work in rural areas first is certainly a contentious one. Despite there are valid arguments to the contrary. I personally believe it is better for them work in cities after graduation. While working in rural areas should just be one option among other options. Ċ From my perspective, teachers and doctors should go where there is the greatest demand for them. With the current trend of rural depopulation and uncontrolled growth of cities, countryside is no longer the most urgent place that keen need teachers and doctors. Instead, some regions in cities such as suburban districts and slums (in less affluent countries particular) often have a huge demand for education sources and medical care. Rather than serving the minorities in remote areas, I feel that fresh graduates should devote themselves for the sake of the majority population in urban areas. Ċ Yet, perhaps the strongest argument in favor of young teachers and doctors working in cities is that of human rights. Even if rural dwellers have the same right to obtain high quality education and medical care as some of their counterparts have in cities, new graduates also human beings, they also have the right to determine where to live and work. Given that most young people tend to find job in cities, dispatching new teachers and doctors to work in rural areas would be a violation to their civil liberty. Ċ In conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that fresh graduates should work in cities because they can help more people there. As choosing workplace is a human right, we should only encourage those people who willingly serve in rural areas."
10504,"Sports which are violent, such as boxing and wrestling have no place in a civilised society and should be banned. Do you agree or disagree ?","Sports are a great means of portraying one's expertise despite it being violent or gentle. Games such as boxing and wrestling bring out the true potential in a person. It has given us many famous and strong personalities who have created histories like Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson and many others. Hence, I completely disagree with the statement that boxing should be banned in a civilised society. I will explain my reasoning in this essay. Ċ Firstly, people participate in athletics like wrestling because they are ardent about it and enjoy doing it. It also helps to remove young boxers from poverty when they find themselves in a situation where all other doors are closed. Apart from that, it teaches young folks to look after their bodies. For instance, if someone really wishes to be successful then they need a high degree of physical fitness. It teaches discipline. As well as things like exercise and diet and furthermore informs players when and when not to fight. As a result, establishes mental and physical control. Ċ Secondly, it educates youths about self-defence so that they can protect themselves in need. To illustrate, if a person falls prey to some goons then he or she can use the tactics learnt to save themselves. On the contrary, there is no general intent to injure the opponent in this athletic. Rather, the primary aim is to score the most by hitting strictly defined regions of the body. And at the very least, it can provide a sense of self-respect. Ċ To conclude, pugilism involves fighting but it is not physically aggressive like rugby or ice hockey. As mentioned earlier in the essay, I totally detest and oppose the statement regarding the ban of this sport. People play it because they enjoy doing it and besides it increases self-esteem."
10505,"Could anyone kindly help me edit my essay? Topic :  Do you agree following statement: ""For becoming well-informed, people have to review different news resources.""","After internet has become available to all over the world, people are capable to access to various information from different regions and fields. Many have concerned that modern citizens would be overwhelmed by the ocean of information. Meanwhile, people hold opposite opinion cite that getting message from different news resources would help people to understand events under more objective perspective. As far as I concerned, I agree to the latter statement for following reasons. Ċ Most of time, readers have to get the messages from different areas for fully grasping the events. Nowadays, many media present news in the perspective of one specific field, such as economy, biology, finance etc. People could be half informed if they only read one newspaper. For instance, when scientists invent a new electronic device, The Economist may public an article to discuss about its influence on international trade. While, other media, such as Biology Magazine, may question about its negative effect on human health. People need to collect all of info from different expert for fully understanding the new device. Ċ In face, sometimes collecting information from range of areas is not even enough. Occasionally, it is necessary to listen to ideas from two opposite views. Take the Senkaku island event in July 2010 as an example. After Chinese fishermen were captured by Japanese authority in the disputed island, Senkaku, both local media started to defend their own countries efficiently. If a person only reads news report from one side, it is highly possible that he/she will be misled. In such extent, people who want to know the fact will benefit from listening to the argument from both sides or even the third media. Ċ In conclusion, I believe people will be well-informed if they get information from different news resources. Although most of media report events from their narrow perspective, but people could receive more objective views by collecting different type of news."
10506,Some people say that children given pocket money every week will have Ċ fewer money problems when they become adults. Do you agree or disagree?,"Money has become an important issue among family members. A number of people think that giving pocket money to children weekly will reduce money problems in their future life as an adult. I completely agree with this view and I believe that children should learn how to manage a budget which is given by their parents. Ċ First of all, it is thought that allowance received by parents does not contribute children’s life when they become adults. However, children learn about cash management in their early life if parents give them to a bit money per week. Moreover, children improve their money management skills by experiencing to spend their allowance. For example, research says that children can develop self-awareness to spend money, and it can be taught effectively how to handle a budget. Therefore, parents give pocket money to their children. Ċ Secondly, children can learn how to spend a money wisely, and how to save money for their needs. Such childhood experiences teach children to put their money aside weekly and save their money, which is beneficial for them in the long run. For instance, today, many people, who did not learn to manage finances in early ages, suffer from more a high amount of debts than those who had a knowledge of cash management. Thus, pocket money given in early age is a useful tool to improve financial management. Ċ In conclusion, a knowledge of money management requires an early experience of expenditure and savings. I fully agree with the idea that pocket money is an effective learning tool in associated with managing money in order to reduce future financial problems."
10507,Young people these days tend to be less polite and respectful than in the past. Whatare the causes and give your solutions?,"The upbringing of a child has been a contentious issue for decades, and many parents and countries try to introduce new ways to improve the quality of life for them. Some people complain that younger generation these days are disrespectful and arrogant, which has grown concerns among parents and nations to scour for the reasons behind it, and the steps that could be undertaken to resolve these circumstances. In this essay, we shall discuss the causes and the possible solutions to it. Ċ In the modern world, not everyone is fortunate enough to have a decent background or the correct environment, rather, many individuals are born in poverty or unacceptable surroundings. Moreover, due to lack of education most people reside in a difficult lifestyle which eventually leads them to bad influences. Similarly, the scenes shown on television and other media platforms portrays an awful image to the society, for instance, violence and criminal activities are more profound and uncensored in films and series which has a direct impact on people’s mind especially teenagers. Lastly, parents lack of attention also leads children in a wrong direction. Overall, certain measures can be taken to rectify this problem. Ċ First of all, the main aim should be to educate children at an early age, because at a tender age, an individual is less repulsive and more understanding. Secondly, parents should sit and explain their offsprings about the value and importance of being generous and kind. Thirdly, local communities and governments should foment programs for such youths, for example, people who were arrogant and impatient in their lives and learnt lessons from it should be able share their stories and explain these younger generations about the damages of having such attitude. Additionally, friends and families should bond with each other in order to dissolve this behaviour. Ċ To summarize, there are two sides to a coin, hence, although the reason of these problems are many, it is evident that certain measures like the ones mentioned above could resolve this matter. Nevertheless, it is essential for an individual to have manners and etiquettes to be prosperous in life."
10508,Some people think watching TV and films makes children more creative. Others think that it can actually lower their creativity. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Several individuals imagine that observing television programs causes kids to be innovative whereas the other outlook is that it reduces their innovativeness. I tend to conform to the first view but both will be discussed in this essay. Ċ Firstly, when children watch TV, they can learn and copy fresh skills for doing many things like art, music, language and so forth. Furthermore, certain shows on the screens are actually dedicated to harnessing creative skills. For example, SABC has a program that teaches kids how to make crafts. Many learn craft-making as early as pre-school and sell some of their products in the streets of Cape Town with the assistance of their parents. Ċ On the other hand, however, TV sets can hinder children's creative development because when they spend time on shows, all they want to do is to copy what they see instead of developing independent innovative aptitudes. Secondly, some of the films are addictive, leaving young people with less and less interest to learn other things. For example, I started preventing my daughter from watching Pepper Pig because I realised that she was no longer interested in learning English accents other than those used in the cartoon. When I did this, she suddenly became comfortable speaking in Irish and Canadian accents. Ċ In conclusion, therefore, I concur with those people who think that watching televised and filmed content makes children more creative. I am basing my opinion on the factors discussed in the essay above. Nevertheless, the other perspective cannot be overlooked."
10509,"Topic: Nowadays, artificial intelligence is being used to drive car. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative development?","Recently, automobile driven by artificial intelligence is becoming more and more popular. This is due to the need to cut cost of transportation industry. The progress should be viewed positively as it will make our life more convenient. Ċ Self-driving car appeared to satisfy the demand to reduce expense of transportation industry. Recent surveys showed that an average taxi service business spends 40% of their expense on driver wage and human resources management cost. Saving this cost to invest more in vehicle and customer services will result in higher income for the company and better experience for customers. This can be done by replacing the traditional vehicle by driverless car. By doing this, business will no longer need to hire drivers and manage them, thus, a lot of expense can be saved. For example, autonomous buses used to take workers to work are being tested in Texas, USA. They helped solve the problem of driver shortage and cut off labor expense effectively. Ċ Self-driving vehicle should be considered a good development as it makes human life more convenient. In order to travel by car, we have to spend time and money to learn driving skill or hire a driver and depend on him to take us to where we want to go. On the contrary, autonomous cars give people the freedom to travel anywhere anytime without acquiring driving skill. It is estimated that an average person in Vietnam spends at least 3 months and 2000 US dollar to learn how to drive. By owning a vehicle driven by artificial intelligence, we can save this cost to spend on other things. Ċ In conclusion, vehicle driven by artificial intelligence appeared as a result of the attempt to reduce labor related expense. As this invention help improve our living standards, we need to see it as a good development."
10510,The news has no connection with most people’s life and it is therefore a waste of time for most of us for reading newspaper and watching television news program. What extend do you agree or disagree?,"Someone argued that it is unnecessary for us to read the news due to it is isolated from our lives. Personally, I strongly disagree with this statement. In this essay, several benefits of learning news will be listed to prove the importance of becoming aware of surroundings. Ċ To begin with, it is quite wrong to believe the news is far from our lives. On the contrary, most of the events happen around us. For instance, it is universally known that nowadays Coronavirus is popular in China. Thanks to the rapid spread of the news among all the media platforms, more and more people attach more significance to staying at home in order to prevent the infection. It is obvious that the news becomes an essential avenue to inform the public about events which may affect them, keeping society safe and ordered. Ċ In addition, the news is a broad category: we find the news catering to diverse interests, ranging from sports to fashion. It is a kind of source where your viewpoints stem from. Meanwhile, the news greatly shows not only those unknown things occurring on the opposite side of the world which literally opens your horizon, but also those advanced researches which do huge benefits to your lives. There is countless valuable information in the news and it is definitely a pity for you to ignore them. Ċ In conclusion, the news provides plenty of useful resources which closely link to everyone over the world. Therefore, in my opinion it is advisable to access to the news regularly, which helps you move outside the narrow zone of your personal affairs."
10511,"QUESTION: Some people believe that countries should invite foreign companies to open their branches, offices and factories in order to develop their economy. Others think countries should invest in their own companies instead. discuss both views and give your own opinions.","It is argued that to boost a country's financial system, the authority better expand branches and manufacturers with oversea institutions. Personally, I agree with this suggestion. However, it seems to many that spending on domestic firms is more preferable. Ċ Investment in local companies might assist a country to develop independently. In other words, it is obvious that given enough national funding, enterprises are more capable of producing things to serve the whole nation, as well as to export. Therefore, the domestic economy will be promoted and the quality of products will also be raised without being influenced by other nations. For instance, by applying advanced technologies and paying more attention to each technical stage, numerous fresh Vietnamese fruits, such as litchi, mango, etc. have reached many European countries with rigorous testing requirements. Ċ Having said that, I believe that cooperation with external businesses should be encouraged as it brings about several well-paid job opportunities and a better working environment. That is to say, if people want to be accepted by an international company, there may be a need for them to fulfil strict requirements, such as being fluent in English or owing specialized degrees. As a result, staff in these firms have all the right to receive high payment. That aside, foreign partnerships often offer workers state-of-the-art equipment, which is advantageous in increasing productivity. Also, local employees may have the chance to work with well-educated and professional colleagues in a multilingual atmosphere, thus enhancing knowledge, both practical and academic. Ċ In conclusion, even though internal companies have some noticeable advantages, I suppose bigger effort should be focused on inviting oversea businesses. Consequently, not only the local economy but also residents themselves benefit from it."
10512,"Environmental problems are so big that they cannot be solved by any person or country alone. Instead, it should be solved at international level. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view? Who is responsible for pollution?","Environmental problems exist in most of the countries in the world. Due to the problems are not geologically isolated, such as water pollution and air pollution, it is necessary to solve in an multilateral way. Ċ Many people support global-cooperation to solve environmental problems. one reason is that pollutions are not geological limited.for instance, the water polluted in one country can flue into another country along with river or underground river. nations need to cooperate to pass some multilateral contract to solve these issues. Another reason is that some less developed countries have no enough technique or capital to deal with complex environmental problems, so they need other countries' help deal with some issues. Ċ Another voice of solve environmental problems by country alone also exist. firstly, if some pollution or ecological balance deterioration only appear in the nations which only care about economic benefits and don't try to stop this phenomenon spread,it is absolutely to solve this kind of issues by the countries alone. Secondly, if the pollution only have severe impact on one country's people and environment and they can't find the country who want to help them, they have no choice but to solve the pollute issue alone by themselves. For example, some inland countries produce many pollute water and draw it to inland lake, because the pollution sites are far away from other countries, so the other country have no necessary to interfere with the problems. Ċ In conclusion, solve the environmental by any person or country is welcome, but national cooperation is more important."
10513,Some people say that government should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help people prevent illness and disease. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"It has been argued that the state should pay attention to environmental deterioration as well as accommodation related issues, in order to prevent illness and disease. I totally agree with the aforesaid notion. In this essay, I will discuss, in the first paragraph, how it would be feasible for the government with the support of levy paid by the community and in the second paragraph, the needfulness of huge infrastructure and a large number of efforts which are only within the reach of government fundings. Ċ To commence with, the taxes paid by citizens of a nation are crucially significant and this collective amount which directly goes into the government's bank account should be utilised for people's benefit. In other words, almost every nation collects legal taxes from their citizens such as property tax, water fine, housing contribution, business tax and taxes on the purchase of gold and allied elements. So, it is a moral responsibility of a country to look after the basic necessities such as a proper and livable environment along with housing facilities, especially for the people of the lower economic groups. For instance, in India, the city called 'Chandigarh' is the most well-organised city which is planned and monitored by authorities as far as environmental pollution and dwellings are concerned. As a result, the population in Chandigarh are more healthy and living in a spacious and clean atmosphere than the rest of the places. Ċ Secondly, to control pollution from various modalities and to provide decent living place needs extravagant resources, which are within a reach of any national fundings and it is not possible for a single individual or a group of people. To make it clear, I would like to exemplify that, air pollution can be controlled by applying stringent rules, to next water pollution can be controlled by providing excellent sewage control channels, then noise disturbances can be minimized by no horn policies or setting appropriate regulations, after that farming which is the largest industry providing food could be supported with infrastructure, knowledge and subsidies to farmers. Finally, the slum areas could be converted into neat and clean apartments with basic amenities like electricity and water. All these things can be only done by democracy as it requires huge money. Ċ In conclusion, a country should be responsible for providing a clean atmosphere and a healthy living place to their citizens. In my opinion, I believe that it is absolutely within the capacity of a nation and the taxes paid by people should be justified by giving them facilities."
10514,"Reading fiction such a short stories and novels, is more fun than watching motion pictures. Do you agree or disagree ?","Nowadays, there are many sources of entertainment but most people prefer to read books, novels and watch movies for entertainment. A 'fiction' is anything that is invented or imagined Ċ by writers. i disagree to this statement and present my point of view in forthcoming paragraphs. Ċ There motion pictures gives relaxation to people because in modern-era life is too hard to live. Besides this, movies provide more entertainment and fun in the life of humans and by watching pictures people able to know about all colors of life within a less time. Moreover, movies gives positive impact on the life of a nation and it also reveals the importance in life. There are many videos responded for spiritual and moral values and it shows the high standard of social life. Furthermore, it is a good source of spending leisure time and by watching movies people can able to understand the value of their life. Ċ On the other hand, some people thinks that reading imaginary stories and novels is good for fun because by reading , the thinking of people becomes more stronger and creative. Moving further, people can develop their imaginary power by reading and it is a better way to know about the information. It also helps to improve vocabulary and it is more interactive medium than movies. Ċ In a nutshell, it can be stated that there are more people who prefer to watch movies rather-than reading books and novels."
10515,Some people think that buildings such as flats and houses should be designed to last a long time. Others believe that it is more important to provide accommodation quickly and cheaply. Ċ Discuss both these views and give your opinion,"Nowadays, the population is increasing rapidly, thus more houses are needed. Some communities have enough money or excess to design or buy high-quality dwellings that last a long time. Others just want to find cheap accommodations to live in. I believe that the houses should be built carefully before using. Ċ On the one hand, almost all the properties were carefully designed by architects, so every unit has a different style. A good building is usually made from good raw materials to give the occupants a rather impressive feeling. But, good quality buildings often come at an expensive or reasonable price. Big investments result in comfortable living as well as the least problems. For example, if a host wants to design or buy a good quality house, the host and architects have to invest more time and money. Then the host will have a high-quality house to live in for a long time. Ċ On the other hand, some people want to stay in a cheap house which has a fast process of construction because they have low income or they just want a place where they can live, so cheap and quick accommodation is the best choice for them. Additionally, cheap and quick accommodation will provide them with more living options to choose from. Although the accommodation may be cramped or of poor quality, it provides low-income people with a safe dwelling. For instance, many students or workers stay in a cheap place and in my country (Vietnam) many buildings were erected to serve the poor people to live in. Ċ To sum up, I believe that having a high-quality house is likely to be better in the long-term. Cheap and quick accommodation is a better choice for people who have low income."
10516,Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Do you agree or disagree with the above statement? Give your own opinion on the issue. Use your own experience or an example to support your idea. You should write at least 250 words,"Entertainment is necessary for all individuals to keep going in life. It can be in various forms and one of the types is playing. From my perspective, they are vital for both grown-ups and youngers. I completely agree with this notion and will be supporting this with my own experience. Ċ To begin with, primarily, playing sports is a great stress buster and it is obvious that in today's modern world there is hardly a human who is completely tension free. Hence, enjoying some games can help in diverting the mind from the regular routine. Secondly, there is always a child hidden in each soul, which needs some sort of fun, relaxation and appreciation. Moreover, playing with each other can help the person to showcase their hidden talent and getting prizes in competitive games can boost confidence. For instance, I was really fond of playing badminton in my school years but as time passed on I got accompanied by my studies, family and work-life which was making me depressed and stressed of regular schedule. Then got an opportunity to join a sports club nearby, I attend this regularly at the weekends and this one day keeps me going happily throughout the week. Ċ In addition to this, there can be numerous benefits of having recreation even at older ages. Firstly, a plethora of people are having sedentary jobs so if they choose to play athletics, this can be helpful to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Also worth mentioning, playing indoor games with family especially with children can really develop a healthy bond between them, consequently, parents can utilise this time to teach many things in a playful manner. For example, my father used to play a card game with me when I was young and would use to give valuable teachings through the game such as we should never cheat in any aspect, failure is a stepping stone to success,etc. Additionally, sport teaches children to be strong and take failures positively to work more hard from the very early years of growth. Ċ In conclusion, I opine, age is just a number and it should not stop a person from doing any activity which he enjoys. Likewise, a person should always take out time for their hobbies, so that they can live life to the fullest without taking it as a burden. However, it is our own responsibility to utilise hours wisely and enjoy them only in leisure."
10517,"With the evolution of technological development, buses, cars or trucks will be self-driving and only passengers will take part in the trip. In my personal perspective, this advancement in traffic brings more benefits rather than any drawbacks which may cause.","Nowadays, the higher the development in technology, the lesser the role of humans. To illustrate this driverless cars, buses and tracks were sprung up in some places and only passengers are travelling on the vehicle. Although there are positive and negative outcomes, it seems to me that cons probably be followed after the benefits, as this kind of improvement is not suitable for long term usage. Ċ Firstly, in the minority of developed countries,researchers invent techniques to make the community more convenient, as a ,result the replacement of drivers is all the hype these days. By using non-human driving cars, man-made accidents such as speed violation, disobedience at no parking zone and problems due to drinking alcohol. Subsequently, the penalty charges would also be decreased. Ċ However, despite the advantages, drawbacks might rise in the future. To elaborate this, as the vehicles are running with artificial intelligence, there will be some unexpected problem at giving command; misunderstanding by the automation. Moreover, the unemployment rate of riders would also be skyrocketed. Additionally, when there is an emergency road accident, in ordinary public transport, emotional communication should be used in this case, even though, we could not imagine how this sophisticated machinery may respond. Likewise, in some areas,where there have an enormous variation of weather conditions,which means the occurrence of natural disasters,like, snowstorms, tsunamis and pouring rain, nobody knows riderless buses may halt driving or not. Ċ On the whole, every improvement has benefits for the nation, nevertheless, there are some disadvantages to modern technology. If robotic technology can substitute in the place of mankind, our world would become an artificial place. After taking everything into consideration, I tend to disagree that the positive effects of driverless automation outweigh the negative."
10518,The world has become a safer place than it was hundred years ago and the government should stop large amounts of money on the arm forces. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"In this day and age, putting effort into protecting the homeland is playing a crucial role due to existing other national threats. Whether bearing in mind that the contemporary world is a better place to decline our investment in military services can be deemed as a debate. In spite of the fact that some might either advocate or refute this notion, I tend to see it as a double edge sword. Ċ Some reasons can be provided to support this belief, the first of which is that central governments tend to solve their problems with communications. In other words, they try to put forward their desires through some diplomatic ways in conflict with other nations since they are aware of the war consequences either for their people or the other countries citizens. If one of the politicians go further from their responsibility, the others will not take this the whole nation purpose. In order to illustrate, a diplomat was criticized for his behaviour in front of other national communities ten years ago, and nobody takes serious his act. Ċ In contrast, some believe that providing protection should not be neglected, the main argument is that weakness in military forces can lead to losing the government power, which means that the safety of the country can be threatened due to the lack of sufficient army forces. Although politicians should not follow violence with their soldiers, having a potent, considerate enforcement is inevitable. For instance, in the last few decades, some small nations decide to destroy their military by devoting less financial resources to them and as a result, they had to pass their possessions to some brutal attackers. Ċ In conclusion, having contemplated over allCorrect your spellingoverallThe word over all seems to be miswritten. Consider replacing it. Ċ show examples influential factors, I tend to opine that this idea can be both supported to some extent and opposed due to mentioned arguments. Therefore, I stand in the middle of the ground."
10519,What can governments do to encourage children to eat a healthier diet? Children's health also in the hands of government,"Children's health plays a vital role in the growth of country; however, most people are less concerned about children's health. The deterioration in their health has increased recent years because of their bad eating habit. Therefore, governments should take measures to raise awareness along with boosting children to eat a healthier diet. Ċ The first point I should mention is that governments should bring out some rules to regulate the food industries. In particular, governments can require food producers to fortify their products with vitamins and hygiene substances. Consequently children would eat healthier food without having to change their habits. However, this would be unpopular and expensive for food producers. Ċ Another feasible approach which I should say is that government should regulate school meals owing to the fact that school meal could institute the majority of children's food consumption. Furthermore, government could require schools to provide healthy food and drink for students including breakfast, lunch and dinner if possible. The positive consequence is that children would have healthy meals every day. But this would not prevent children from bringing unhealthy packed food or going out to fast food outlets. Ċ Besides, governments should ask school to include cooking as an official curriculum. Moreover, schools must choose healthy eating patterns that contain less sugar and fat in order to teach students. According to this, children know which food contains nutrition, take pride in their cooking and transfer these skills to their home. The drawback is that schools may not have the facilities to teach cooking. Ċ In conclusion, governments should take children's health as a matter urgency. Not only the government but also the school are responsible for this problem."
10520,Many people believe that women make better parents than men and this is why they have the greater role in raising children in most societies. Others claim that men are just as good as woman at parenting. Do you agree?,"Regardless of whereabouts in the world, mothers tend to have a stronger role when raising children compared to their husbands. However, the reasons behind this phenomenon are not very clear. While many believe there is a natural explanation on why women are better at caring, others argue that both parents have the same capabilities if given the opportunity of equal parenting. In my opinion, all possible differences rely only on gender roles rather than any possible genetic make-up. Ċ There are many reasons why women are targeted as the most responsible, caring and strong role among parenting. Ever since early childhood, girls are being prepared for the day they become mothers and house-runners. A clear example stands out when looking at the toys girls play with: from baby dolls to mini-kitchens or cleaning products, everything is designed to prepare them for future maternity. In addition, families tend to organise the caring of elderlies or babies using barely only female members. For example, is very common that the daughter takes care of the old grandfather while male members of the family go out to play, work or practise sports. As a consequence of these gender roles, when becoming parents, women tend to be more prepared than men. Ċ On the other hand, there are several experiences that prove how men are as capable as women when it comes to parenthood. An obvious example is when the mother unfortunately dies and the father needs to be in charge of all the family. There are no biological hurdles for him to satisfy all children's needs. In fact, many parents complain about the lack of opportunities and space to play a more present role. For instance, in many countries, parental leave is 3 months for the mother but only 2 weeks for the father, therefore they lack time to bond with the child and assume responsibilities. Ċ To sum up, although the role of women has always been more important when raising children, recent debates have shown that fathers can be equally important with the proper environment. The only difference between both parents is the gender roles assigned by society but there are no natural characteristics that make mothers better than fathers."
10521,"Children are under increasing educational, social, and financial stress. Some people think this is a positive development. Do you agree?","Currently, more students are suffered from overloading the stress from education, society and finance, which is believed as a positive development to make students achieve better academic performance by some individuals. However, as far as I concerned it is not a good idea to cultivate children by giving them too much stress. It is except that children are under a proper stress that make them work harder than their peers. Ċ In terms of schooling, I admit that the stress, sometimes, can become a motivation to those children, who are going to work hard in order to get rid of stress. In addition, by exposing to stress, children might learn how to tackle the problems that they may meet during working life, which is a good practice on school before they start their real social life. Ċ Unfortunately, some children complaint that they are indeed taking too much pressure from educational, social, and financial problems. It seems the pressure could not be released easily by themselves, regardless of what solutions they come up with. As a consequence of that, children are disappointed by their academic results that are caused by the stress, and entering a vicious cycle. Ċ In my opinion, children are undertaken too much stress than what we expected. Sometimes the stress create a huge burden to children, if they can not deal with it properly. In order to have a healthy cycle in schooling, we should focus on how to cultivate the interests of study rather than pushing children forward just by giving them stress."
10522,TOPIC: Some people think that family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use example to support your opinion,"These days, youngsters are susceptible to be had an impact on many factors. While many people believe that they are impacted the most by friends, Some support family is far more influential on their children than friends. From my perspective, I agree later. Ċ It is clear that family life is the closest place that youngsters have had since they were born. They have more chances to meet their older people in their family including their grandparents, parents, sisters, and brothers having many different character traits. Therefore, the elderly would teach youngers how to do whatever they know when all members of the family do some jobs together. For example, When young adults do household chores with their parents, they will be taught how to clean the house, cook, iron facilitating parents to influence their children on cleaning which friends could not share. Ċ Secondly, Young adults tend to respect and trust their family members more than friends they have met. This acts as a precursor for young people to listen and follow their family. For instance, when they have a mental or physical disorder, they tend to tell and ask bits of advice from their parents who have a lot of experience to offer. Ċ In conclusion, I strongly believe that members of the family are the most significant impact on children owing to the frequent meeting chance and respect in the elderly."
10523,‘spare the rod and spoil the child’ is a saying which means that child should be disciplined for their own good. What are your views on the topic of discipline?,"Throughout the centuries, there have been multiple strategies, regarding children’s upbringing and most rely on the principle of discipline. But some parents strongly disagree with this viewpoint. In my opinion, youngsters should be regulated, but to a certain level and in this essay I will explain why. Ċ Firstly, some parents, because of their urge to protect their child and grow him up as a complete individual, tend to be extremely strict. Although, this might sound ideal, it is not. This has severe consequences for their child’s future, mostly in becoming a part of the society. To illustrate, from my own experience, my cousin was disciplined in a harsh way till he was 18, after that he went to University and found difficulties in communicating and making friends. Finally, in this way they disregard his needs to socialise and have fun at a younger age, which can result in extreme behaviours in the future. Ċ On the other hand, there are some parents that give too much freedom to their children. As a result, they do not listen to them, and spend all their time on having fun with friends or playing video games, rather than thinking about their future. For example, the University of Cambridge surveyed and found out that, 75% of youngsters that were barely disciplined at a young age, ended up either unemployed or working in minimum wage jobs. Lastly, the lack of control, can lead their children, in some cases, to unpleasant situations, such as illegal substance use. Ċ Taking everything into consideration, it’s my firm belief that, having moderate control of your child is the key to a balanced upbringing. This will give him the chance to have a social life, while also achieve higher goals and ensure a prosperous future."
10524,nowadays people are not fit and active as before. these will have negative effect in the future health. what are the reasons and solution to this issue.,"At present. The health issue is a highly debated topic globally. There has been soaring in the number of unhealthy people who do not have an enough energy and proper proper wellness in comparison to the older people who belong to the previous time. There are several causes and solutions to this menace. Firstly, this essay would discuss how sedentary life style makes people ill and unfit. Secondly, discuss how awareness raising among the civilians could tackle this issue to some extent. Ċ To start with. The main cause of being unhealthy is the sedentary lifestyle. As the technology enhanced, Folks have more options to skip their work that requires a physical involvement of the body. Therefore, they allocate their time by seating-in front of the TV or surfing the internet for the whole time. Consequently, they develop a serious disease like obesity and cholesterol and so on. For instance, As per the Oxford university survey, 70% of the people are being ill due to the advanced technology. Ċ Nonetheless, every problem has a solution in the same way this has too. The prime solution is the awareness raising among the public and this could be implemented by the regime. So that folks would follow appropriate and accordingly by thinking that it is the government order. As a result, people would discover the information about the future consequences of not taking care of the health. For example, according to the Australian medical association. 60% of the Australian public taking care of their health after the government’ Campaign. Ċ In conclusion, it is true that the number of unhealthy people has been increasing because of the latest cultural and that might give a devastating future impact.However, if both the regime and the individuals take an equal effort to tackle this issue, then this problem definitely declined to a certain level."
10525,In many cases the development of a country is accompanied by pollution and environmental damage. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Can it be simply avoided if the country takes an environmentally friendly approach?,"There is no doubt that the turn of current century has witnessed a tremendous development in many aspects of industries. Most of industrial developments are attached with side effects that could destroy the environment in long term. As we live in this infected environment, definitely, we will suffer from illness and fatigue. I'm strongly agree with the statement that the development of a country is accompanied by pollution and environmental damage. I will review specific reasons to support my point. Ċ First of all, the competition among the car manufacturers, make them severely strive to enhance the features of the car to make it more comfortable. Few manufactures thought about manufacture a car that working by gas to be more compatible with the environment. For example, as per the last statistics of the International Union of Cars 3% of car manufactures designed an engines that working by gas instead of petrol to avoid air pollution. Ċ Moreover, everybody know the importance of the electricity on our lives. Governments used to use the gasoline to run the electricity generators, but nowadays, governments are looking forward to use the solar energy instead to kill two birds with one stone. Firstly, to minimize the country budget, because the use of gasoline is very costly. Secondly, to generate electricity that are environmentally friendly to decrease the risks of the pollution. For instance, government of New Zealand started to use the solar energy to run the windmills since 2010, because they discovered that the use of gasoline causes many health damages for people. Ċ All in all, it's very obvious that country development makes the people life become more comfortable, this may be true to some extent, but people lives deserve to care about. Pollution has a great impact on people health which threaten their life, unless the country takes an environmentally friendly approach to avoid pollution and environmental damage."
10526,"Some people view teenage conflict with their parents as a necessary part of growing up, whilst others see it as something negative which should be avoided. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Generation gap all the time is the typical problems in families around the world; however, due to all people are different, so conflicts between parents and their children are various too. As a result, one type of conflict, such as difference between ages, could be a part of upbringing, whereas others, such as incomprehension or violence on account of different factors are the negative impact that necessarily avoids. Hence, both sides of the topic debate somehow right and have valuable argument, in my opinion. Ċ First of all, few people can deny the fact that all persons have problems with previous generations in part of behaviour or a point of view that not always is wrong; thereby such conflict is an inevitable part of our life, which somehow help us grow up. Presently elderly people, for example, incomprehension the sedentary style of life teenagers because remember period when people were more active. Likewise, parents adjust and correct some modern behaviours or modern words, which inappropriate in certain areas. Thus, the generation gap is inevitable and essential part of life. Ċ Nevertheless, the majority of parents use violence method to enforce own view of their children that leads to ambiguous aftermaths. In educational establishments, for instance, have been noticed many problems with the mental health of students, which root has from home upbringing. Furthermore, some conflicts have psychological character, owing to parents expected more from children or relieve own problems by scandals at home. Consequently, society needs separate conflicts by their types and the type of non-generations gap necessarily avoid in order to prevent problems in the future. Ċ To conclude, I believe that conflicts between children and parents is an inevitable part of our life. Moreover, if this conflict without violence and have a reason of correction inappropriate behaviour, it obviously helps us to grow up."
10527,"Money offered for post graduate research is limited; as a consequence, some people argue that financial support from the government should only be provided for scientific research rather than research for less useful subjects. Do you agree or disagree?","Financial support is one of the important needs for graduates and postgraduates in other to fulfil their research. However, some people claim that the government should only financially support scientific research rather than other subjects . In my ,opinion I totally agree with the statement because science contributes to the evolution of the world . Ċ To begin, the science industry requires a lot of attention and financial support because they are the most important cooperation in the world .Furthermore, they contribute to the survival of species and the well being of humans as well as animals . For instance , in the year ,2020 the whole world faced the COVID-19 pandemic which had an impact on the nation. Each country,especially Europe had to financially support the scientist to supply a vaccine. This actually helps them to provide us in this year 2021 with a different type of vaccine that is helping the community to fight against the virus. Ċ In addition, investing in postgraduate scientists is supporting the medical and technology research department for a better and easier future way of life . This is the best way for the government to improve the science industries to fight against future problems and also upgrade our life . For example, our way of communicating has been boosted for the past 10 years with the support of science. We can be connected at all times, working from a long distance and also been in touch with one family at every moment of the day . Thus , it is much easier to communicate and facilitate our conversation. Ċ In conclusion,the government should invest more in scientists because the earth depends on their research to enhance the upcoming events that can affect negatively one life. And also,their contribution to technology can make our living environment a better place as well as contributing to the evolution of the nation."
10528,"Most people say that life without smartphones today would be impossible. However, a minority argue that the word would be better if it were smartphone - free. What is your opinion? better world without smartphones?","The twenty first century is known as the technological era, humankind is dominated by high technology. That said, anywhere at any time of the day, you can see the state - of - the - art devices, particularly smartphones. A great number of people argue that without smartphones, it is difficult to people to survive. However, many argue that our life will be no longer hustle and bustle anymore if we do not use smartphones. Ċ One the one hand, smartphone has numerous benefits. Compare to the first generation of telephones which are bulky and have little function, mobile phones now are more tricky and compact, so you can bring them anywhere you like. Not only do they use to text messages or make phone calls, but they also alike laptops that can access the network, download information. What is more, thanks to would - be phones, people acquire new skills or update latest news. Taking picture is no longer need a camera because today you have smartphone having a function to do that. The quality of pictures is in no way interior to one's camera. Ċ On the other hand, some who continue to suggest otherwise, arguing the world would be better if it were smartphone - free. Living without the, we are become cooler person, when we hang out with friends, for example, we interact more and do not focus on phones which give rise to a stable friendship. Being phone - free, more time do you relax, much stress will you decrease. No e - mails, no phone calls, no messages, that means there will no pressure. Ċ In conclusion, like everything else, Smartphones also have merits and demerits. But I'm in favor of using smartphones to make our life better and more modern. And of course, you must using it effectively to make positive use of such advanced technology."
10529,Some people believe you are never too old to learn. How strongly do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience?,"It is irrefutable to say that, education plays a pivotal role in life. Some researchers analyse and say that, you are not too old to learn new skills and while on the other hand, some opine this statement. The following essay would discuss on the both sides of the statement with the help of reasons and relevant examples. Ċ There are myriads of reasons in the favour of education and learning new skills. The most conspicuous one is that, learning is very important to survive in this contemporary era. Technology is changing rapidly and due to drudgery of advancement of technology, robust and artificial intelligence taking place of workers in factories. For instance, BHP Billiton worlds' biggest mining company deployed robots. In addition, learning also improves person's creativity and imagination. As a result, this helps a person to invent new things which can help our society to live properly. Hence, it makes clear learning new skills are very important. Ċ In the contrary, there are people in the world, they think they are in the last part of the life and we are not able to learn new skills thus, they do not learn new techniques and skills. Such as, few decades ago, computer systems started with DOS operating system and, now we have windows 10. Ċ To recapitulate, I pen down saying that a literate is the person who do not learn or relearn not that who do not know how to learn"
10530,"Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Some people support that strict punnishments for driving crimes play a vital role in reducing traffic accidents. In contrast, other individuals espouse the idea that other measures would be more effecive in enhancing road safety. Both sides have, of course, their own merits, I think the first view is more resonable and this essay aims to prove my claim. Ċ First and foremost, strict punishments force habitants to follow right regulations. In other words, punishments have a direct influence on citizens' benefits, which is a good way to improve their awarenesses. For instance, according to Vietnamese governemtn's regulation, drivers having the level of acohols in their body will be punished more than 10,000,000 vnd, which is considered as a big ammount of money. As a result, this rule has an impact on the consumption of acohols drinks as well as helps to dicrease traffice accidents significantly. Ċ On the other hand, other measures such as the quality of road and, of course, would be effective ways to improve road safety. There is no doubt that the quality of road also has a lot of influences on road stafety. As roof, it is proved that wet surface of the road is considered as a cause resulting in a number of traffic accidents in comparision with the good quality of road. However, I still support myself that improving people's awarenesses that strict punnishments are key factors will bring more positive results to reduce traffic accidents. Ċ In conclusion, it is no denied the importance of other methods, the quality of road for example is a good ways to promote road safety. On the contrary, I firmly believe that strict publishments are main factors to reduce traffic problems."
10531,"""Some people believe that it is possible for a country to be economically progressive while having a clean environment at the same time. Some people disagree with this."" Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Prosperous countries without pollutions","Many countries around the globe have sacrificed their environment for economic progress. Nevertheless, some people believe that it is possible to become a developed country without harming the nature, others disagree with that. In this essay I will discuss both views as well as give my own opinion of why I think it is possible to progress without polluting and destroying the environment. Ċ First of all, there are hundreds of examples of countries that have become developed without exploitation of natural resources. For example, Singapore is considered a financial capital of Asia even though this country does not have any oil, gas, metals or other resources. It has been able to achieve such significant success by trading and banking. Ċ However, as a counter argument, opponents can provide the United States and China as examples of countries that exchanged their clean environment for wealth and progress. For instance, despite its' economic growth China is suffering from the consequences of industrialization. There is a constant smog in many Chinese cities that exacerbates people's health. Chinese economic boom could not have happened without the usage of coal and other pollutants. Ċ To conclude, there are some examples of countries that successfully developed without polluting the environment. Currently, even countries such and China and the U.S. which are top pollutants are switching to clean energy solutions. It is a responsibility of every country to develop without harming the nature. It is something that can and should be done."
10532,In many countries people do not recycle their rubbish as much as they could. Why do you think this is? What can be done to change this?,"It is apparent that with increasing environment concerns and the rapid exhaustion of the Earth's natural resources, it is very important to dispose of trash in an eco-friendly manner. There are nevertheless a great number of people all over the world fail to do this in their daily activities. Ċ The primary reasons for this are their awareness and habits. Some decades ago, there are not many concerns about what the global warming is, or how to save our mineral materials and other natural resources. Some people even thought that those resources were unlimited. Consequently, they wasted instead of recycled rubbish as it is possible. Now, despite of the goverments' efforts, citizens in many countries still cannot completely realize the usefulness of recycling as well as change their daily habits being for many years. Ċ The second point of this matter is availability, which is extremely lack of recycling facilities or even they have not existed in some places. In our building, there is just one rubbish bin for all kinds of waste. What should people do with their separated trash? Or are there any meaning of this activity if in the ultimate step, all kinds of waste will be thrown into a dumping ground? Ċ Obviously it is not a work of a person, but all walks of life. By organizing ""green campaigns"", improving citizens' knowledge via means of media and supplying facilities for separated rubbish are things that governments should do to change the citizens' manners. On the other hand, forcing people by levying a fine on those who do not separate their trash is also one of the effective ways to change the habits of people."
10533,Topic -  some people are reducing their walks.however many health experts say that walking is the best exercise to maintain health.why do people wal less? what might encourage people to walk longer distances?,"It is universally acknowledged that health is wealth.Presently,walking is supposed to be a huge privilege for health of mankind.According to health professional,strolling daiy is effective for maintaining the health.But the interest of people toward walking is plunging day by day.In this essay i will analyze the leadind causes of the as well as its solution., Ċ Commencing with the first reason to justify my point is availability of transportation either it is public or private.People have lack of time in this busiest world and therefore,they want to cover distance by using transport modes in order to save their valuable time.Weather is also one of the factor for reducing the walking distance.For instance,people find it hard to walk in hot,humid and in extreme cold conditions.Furthermore,due to increased rate in street crime people shortened their strolling or quit it completely. Ċ In addition,the access to fitness centre also contribute towards the reducing walk yards.For example,all fitness centre have equipment and machinery for people to have walk or jog.Apart from this,due to sacrce of land and space in most of the indeveloped and incipient countries do not have enough footpath for pedestrian. Ċ On the other hand,Government should take initiative to encourage the people for walking,Firstly,they need to put the CCTV cameras or streets to reduce the crime.Secondly,they should provide pavements across the roads for walking,Lastly,they shoul spent some part of the tax in order to build the gardens and parks,whereppeople walk easily.However,here health and all medical checkup institution come forward and maske aware people about the benefits of walking.As a result,people know about all the pros and adopt this beneficial exercise. Ċ To conclude,i would like to say that due to multiple reasons people are afraid to walk on street and reduce their foot walk.But for encouraging people to walk more authorities and health centre need to take some steps to aware about the benefits of this."
10534,Nowadays students are using the Internet as a prompt to receive good marks rather than preparing course work by themselves.  Give your opinion and suggest possible solutions.,"No one can deny the fact that the Internet plays a great role in our lives. Many people are using it daily, for a variety of purposes, particularly for education; It has been claimed that the Internet is deteriorating a learning process by allowing cunning students to cheat in examinations. Ċ As well as offering numerous advantages, the Internet has disadvantages though, namely in terms of education. A current condition has showed that the information availability on the Net serves not only as a tool for self-studying, but for gaining unfair credits. For example, a student with no ability or desire to do course work (projects, assignments) can simply download a required material and present as if he had done it by himself. Consequently, there will be one more ineffective graduate. A single useless worker is not a significant problem for a company, but if there are thousands of them, there should be taken a serious action. Ċ As to the solutions, I think the main thing, which should be taken into consideration is the way students are examined. Rather that giving a certain period of time for preparing paper-based projects, the university authorities can asset students' abilities by putting oral examinations. If there is no opportunity to evaluate them all verbally, as it might be time-consuming, teachers can urge their students to sit a formal examination, which, to my mind, is a relatively effective solution for this pattern. Ċ In conclusion, I have an impression that the way young generations are taught is a superbly significant matter as is determines the general view of the nearest future. Therefore, we should elaborate existing bias and pay attention to every single detail, so that the coming generation will not suffer from our decisions."
10535,"large-scale expansion of advertisement Question: ""Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?""","Advertisements have gained in popularity due to the growth of science and technology. It is apparent that this development has a wide range of advantages for business and consumers. However, it also conceals detrimental impacts that we need to take into consideration. Ċ On the one hand, advertising is key part of modern business which companies utilize to inform customers about their products and services on a large scale. As a result, they are notified of the various options they have and business are likely to reach higher profits. Moreover, advertisement is a creative industry that employs many people. Without this marketing sector, it leads to higher unemployment and the limitation in job opportunies. Ċ On the other hand, advertisements focus on convincing people with a multitude of the product's merits which may be exaggerated and distorted for commercial purposes. Futhermore, marketing often aims at children who are not mature enough to choose an accurate product. Hence, their parents will be put on pressure to buy things for them. If some contain inappropriate content, it will be harmful to the development of children. Ċ In conclusion, both beneficial and negative influences on consumers can be seen as a result of the large-scale expansion of advertisement which is necessary but needs to be regulated. People should take it into account and become smart consumers."
10536,"Some people believe that having sport in schools is a waste of time and resources, whilst other people believe that sport in schools is a vital part of education. Discuss both these views and give your opinion","There is little doubt that a sport is beneficial to academic performance, and it plays a crucial role in education. Nevertheless, some people argue that physical education is inessential as it will waste time and resources. Personally, I firmly believe that athletic participation is indispensable because it will teach students some soft skills. Ċ On the one hand, sports activities are considered to be harmful to teenagers’ educational outcomes because of less time and money allocated for studying. To be specific, some parents think that academic subjects may ensure their children’s well-paid jobs in the future. Consequently, they would rather that students pay exclusive attention to learning these subjects instead of playing sports. In other words, should physical education be put in the curriculum, the amount of time devoted to sports cannot be used for studying, which may be detrimental to their academic performance. Additionally, schools may invest money in sporting equipment rather than teaching one; hence, students will not have the best learning environment. Ċ On the other hand, athletic participation at schools is an opportunity for adolescents acquire essential skills. While playing team sports, they can practice teamwork and communication. For example, to be a good football team, they need to support one another and communicate to understand their teammates. Additionally, sports help teenagers develop ways to cope with failure. If they lose a competition, they will learn to overcome disappointment and do more practice. Therefore, physical education teaches them how to deal with unpleasant experiences as well as being industrious. These lessons definitely play a leading role in their future success. Ċ In conclusion, though less time and resources will be spent in academic study, playing sports offer youngsters' chances to cultivate practical skills. My view is that students should be encouraged to participate in physical activities more to learn useful lessons."
10537,Some people consider price as the most important thing to think about when buying products ( such as cell phone ) or services ( e.g: medical treatment ). Do you agree or disagree,"Clusters of people in the market when buying things often prioritize discount as the most crucial factor to choose ideal goods and services. While I emphasize quality should take the lead, I also believe that the expense is equally important Ċ On the one hand, quality is a great scale for customers in the long run. This reflects the trustworthy side of a manufacture or a brand which offer people with essential possession and lastly durable as it won’t be worn out after a long-time using. Moreover, the norm of perception of construction will decide how secure the manufacture is when it comes to people’s house, thus people may not be aware of the risk or the tragic scenario after having it worked. For example, a cheap service serves them with unkindness and inefficient facilities will no longer take the customers away with insecurity and unpleasant. Not only character entices them with highly-insurance productions, but it also supports and enriches markets. Those will be brightened by people when striving for much better manufactures in the market place, as the results, it will gradually come lying or dishonest businesses to an end and sooner improve people’s live and shopping’s need. Ċ On the other hand, pay would be a mindful thing to consider when buying a product. Firstly, it may guide customers to choose better construction. Every so often, not every product with higher price will provide with assurance, the cost that they are handed out even cheaper than expected, but as many manufactures want to gain more profit, they make them twice and triple time more expensive with the same function as the others. Secondly, customers now crave extravagant goods’ prices, especially wealthy customers who possess these as a status symbol. For example, if a rich buys a luxurious phone with loads of money and then show off to his friends, he would take pride in his friends’ compliment of his wealth. Ċ In short, customers should consider both expenditure and character as a plan to buy the most ideal and long- lasting productions."
10538,Some people think that children of different abilities should be educated together. Other people think that it's better to teach the intelligent children separately and with special treatment. What do you think? Use your own ideas of knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.,"It has been a controversial issue over whether general education or specific education is seemed more suitable for children. Even though some people argue that the former alternative could be benefit children for their future development, I firmly believe that the latter opinion is better for them. Ċ To begin with, dividing children into different classes due to their abilities advantages teachers to formulate better target-oriented contents of courses. On the one hand, a diverse range of knowledge expanded from fundamental courses can be instilled into wise children in order to maximize their talent. On the other hand, teachers can put more attention on the comprehension of basic concept in terms of the other children to guarantee the minimum of syllabus. Ċ Secondly, it is an undeniable fact that both the sense of conceit from clever children and the sense of self-abasement from others exist in the indistinctive education. However, they are not only eliminated. Even better. Because the similar intelligent level children are aggregated, the advanced children turn self-conceited feeling into competitive spirit, and self-abased children commence to help each other. Ċ Last but not least, my opinion can easily find common view, even 2500 years ago. Confucius has said:' teach students in accordance with their aptitude.' The educational philosophy is adopted by offspring and verified as validity. Ċ Given this argument, it is reasonable to conclude that children should be educated according to their natural abilities."
10539,"Traditions are about the past and innovation is about the future, and it has been argued that we need to let go of traditions for the sake of progress. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this? What role should traditions have in our lives? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.","Some people are considered that old customs are obstacles in the way of progress and innovations, and it should be abandoned. In my opinion, I hold a balanced view that individuals can cope with the progression without leaving their traditions as it plays a role model in our lives. Ċ On the one hand, traditions are considered to be our identity. This is because it has many values in our community. For example, in many Arabic countries, a family gathering is vital to people and their beloved ones. As a result, adults should not leave their parents to suffer from loneliness. On the other hand, there are some old customs, which are holding the scientific progress. This is because of their restrictions on religious beliefs. For instance, donate organs is essential for the sake of the greater good to develop vaccinations, and cures for chronic diseases, which can save humankind. Ċ In addition, traditions are a critical factor in some cultures. In other words, customs make us living happy. To illustrate, in Egypt, adults are financially supporting their families even after they marry. Moreover, religious festivals can improve family bonds. This is because people can discuss their daily routines, and unwind their daily stress. To give an example, in Egypt, many families are attending the Easter celebration together, and they share dishes, which hold happiness to attendees. Ċ In conclusion, despite the demerit of traditions in terms of preventing the progress of scientific research, there is a wide range of advantages, which are enhancing the family bonds, and bring happiness to people."
10540,Some people argue that it is good for children to stay away from their families and go to a boarding school. Other suggest that children live with their families and attend a day school. What is your opinion?,"There has always been an argument that kids that stay in school grow to be better adults than those that attend school from the comfort of their homes. However, in my opinion, I think both sides have their pros and cons. Ċ On one hand, people think that children that attend boarding schools do better as young adults, although this may be true, it has some disadvantages. Children in this category tend to be very independent as they learn to survive on their own. For instance, studies have shown that they are more competitive and resilient than their peers in the real world. Nonetheless, juveniles in this group may become wild and engage in dangerous activities such as smoking, taking hard drugs or even participating in immoral behaviours like lesbianism and homosexuality. All these are because they are not supervised by their parents. Ċ On the other hand, those that go to the school from home are well supervised by their parents and all they'll ever need is made available to them hence they are very comfortable. Teens have the opportunity to report back to their parents on their daily activities and get help where necessary. Even though they get all the aforementioned attention, the once in this category, grow to be very dependent on their family even as adults. For example, they tend to run back to their guardians whenever they are faced with challenges and they also could be very indecisive in making decisions since they are used to their Dads and Moms deciding for them. Ċ In conclusion, I am of the opinion that both aspects are good but they both have their drawbacks."
10541,Some people believe that the government should spend more money putting in more works of art like paintings and statues in cities to make them better places to live in. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"I completely agree with the idea of government should support more works of art like paintings and statues in city in term of finance to display them in better places. Ċ A lot of works of art deserve being placed in a formal place instead of any store or even warehouses. A piece of art is a wonderful result of artist's creativity and hard work or even sacrifice important things. They definitely put 100% effort into those arts and consider them as their child. Paintings or statues is not only beautiful as its appearance but also contains profound lessons or reflects a whole specific historical era. For instant, looking at a painting of Old Quarter by Bui Xuan Phai, Vietnamese people can easily conceive how previous generation live and work, this is also significant historical evidence to research about this period of time. Ċ Investing in place for works of art is absolute proper decision, government will see numerous of advantages if they do so. Building picture galleries or museums to exhibit more valuable pictures, sculpture will promise a relatively bright scenario. Firstly, galleries are a model of business which can make huge revenue for artist and nation and furthermore contributing to boost GDP. Seconly,this is a effective way to promote vietnamese culture to foreigners worldwide and lure more visitors to Vietnam. Last but not least, if we can reserve works of arts well the more and more valueable it become because it is witness for history. Ċ In conclusion , government should make places for more worthy works of art because of variety of advantages and potential benefits"
10542,"People have different job expectations for jobs. Some people prefer to do the same job for the same company, whereas others prefer to change jobs frequently. Write about the advantages and disadvantages of each viewpoint?","It is often observed that few people looking forward to their jobs choose to change them however some employees want to work in the same organisation. Considering the benefit of staying at the same job is strong and long-lasting work relationships with the current organization and drawback are limited exposure of knowledge whereas betterment of switching jobs is to learn new technique and difficulty is reduced to the market value of job seekers. Ċ The utmost advantage of staying with the same firm is building a solid and long term relationship. The reason behind this is that workers and employers have the same goal to grow and expand their company in future. Therefore, employees can get senior and leadership opportunities. While workers can learn things to a limited extent only and they have less chance of learning new expertise when they stay at the one company. For example, My friend, John, has been working with the same employer for the last 15 years in a higher position having good knowledge of his company but he is less aware of the new technology of other industries. Ċ On the other hand, while we consider the opposite side of this scenario, changing jobs helps in learning new skills. The reason behind this is that a person is able to explore the environment and work cultures of the new firms. They can not only get knowledge but also receive a higher salary by switching to a new company. Despite the fact, workers who constantly switch their jobs may lose their good market value because of not having long term stability with previous organisations. That is why they may get difficulty in getting a job in the future. Ċ To summarise, it is asserted that working for the same organization leads to building better relations with the employer but it is confined to minimal learning. Yet, changing companies can enhance their skills and wages, its downside is lowering the market value of employees."
10543,Some say living in the city is more comfortable. Other however claim that city life is complicated. Discuss both views and give your opinion. where is the best place to live,"There is contentious issue among citizen whether city life is convenient or not. While there are some benefits gained when deciding to live in the city, there might be some disadvantages should not be overlooked. Ċ On the one hand, those supporting that people are easy to do their activities when living in the city often claim that many public infrastructur can support various kind of activities done by them. For example, if someone wants to take an IELTS test, it will be much cheaper and more efficient to take an IELTS test if they live in the city. Accesible information is also better in the city than in the village. People who are living far from city sometimes get lack of information, the one and only news they got is just from radio station. Ċ On the other hand, the opponents of city life argue that the stressful thing living in the city is mostly because of their traffic congestion. People sometimes take some breakfast and even working on the way they go to work in the early morning due to avoiding the traffic congestion. Living in the city also makes the community life is more individual. People close their door all the day, go to work in the morning and are back home in the evening. Moreover, people in the city mostly have a big fence of house so, it is impossible to talk with their neighbour. Ċ In conclusion, while living in the city is in favour with some advantages given, I also believe that there should be a measure taken to cope with problems which might appear when becoming a city-settler."
10544,Many people think that too much attention and resources are given to the protection of wild animals and birds. Ċ Do you agree or disagree?,"Numerous people believe that much heed and reserves are provided for the preservation of livestock and feathered creatures. I certainly disagree with this notion because the illegal trading of wildlife organisms is still extremely common, and the various endangered species are near extinction. This essay will discuss that why the world has to make more investments to alleviate the current situation. Ċ Firstly, the various wild sparrows and parrots are kept in captivity to sell them as pets in the market. Similarly, the hunting of tigers, wild pigs, and buffaloes is popular in many parts of the world, to obtain game meat. This is to say that, there are still no strict laws to prevent such unlawful acts against innocent creatures. For instance, according to a survey by the World Protection Organisation conducted in 2018 in India, every year, thousands of deers and tigers are illegally killed in southern India. Ċ Secondly, the numerous species of the birds and the animals are no longer living on the earth. In other words, the government of every country requires to protect the remaining wildlife organisms because there are high chances that they may also get extinct soon, which will directly cause a disturbance in the ecosystem. To exemplify, according to a report by The Hindu newspaper, in 2019 in India, owing to the absence of Lions in the North India, the population of monkeys has increased hugely. Thus, we need to monitor these activities, and also provide more funds to achieve it. Ċ In conclusion, the world still lacks the proper arrangement and capital to preserve the animals and birds. Moreover, the extinction and illegal trading of organisms is prevailing everywhere. Hence, the given statement does not seem to be rational."
10545,"Some people think that e-book are the death of the paper books, while others think that paper books will never disappear. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","Over the last decades, e-books are significantly becoming popular in the world and some people think that paper books will still rule the world. This essay will discuss both views and the reason for my inclination is articulated in the following paragraphs. Ċ On the beneficial side of online books, the prime most advantages are accessibility and portability making it easy to access and read books anywhere from the globe. Also, people can get rid of carrying the material from one place to another place. For instance, a student need not worry about the loss of textbooks or damage of notebooks because of the technology all the notes are stored in the cloud which can be assessed whenever he or she needs it. Ċ On the other hand, one of the main plus points of printed books is there is no stress for eyes. Due to this many people are still preferred to buy printed books and use them rather than e-books. Additional, hard books absorb more information and make readers remember what they have read. This mainly benefits children as a result students will have a better focus on reading skills. For example, an individual reading paper books will help to reduce the health problems related to the eyes. Ċ In conclusion, I think that electronic books will rule the world in the coming years because of their advantages and flexibility. However, some section of people thinks that written books will continue to serve people how it was used be. Nevertheless, this innovation can not end the production of paper books."
10546,"car pollutants problem. topic: the increase of cars is polluting the earth and is detrimental to human health. therefore, we should stop using cars so as to make us healthier. do you agree?","Across the globe, the overuse of cars is causing environmental problems which are directly harmful to people's health, while there are some opinions clamming that we should stop using cars to improve people's health. From my perspective, this is not a good way due to some reasons. Ċ As awareness of protecting the environment is on the rise, we often regard the exhaust gas emitted by cars as the culprit of air pollution. What we must focus on, however, is the unscrupulous factories and the lack of environmental policies. For instance, factory emissions contribute greatly to the release of harmful fumes such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which not only reduces air quality but also brings the acid rain that will affect ocean ecology. That is to say, the ban on those factories should be prioritized in order to keep air pollution at bay. Ċ It is also noteworthy that if we limit the use of cars, those who need to drive to work, because they have to spend more time commuting such as taking train or bus, will appear less energetic at work, meaning that it is likely to cause a decline in the productivity of the company or even the country. In other words, to achieve a balance between economy and environment, what we should do is to reduce car usage instead of prohibiting the use of cars. Ċ All in all, although the environment has become worse, we cannot limit the use of cars since it will thus affect the national economy. Moreover, there are other ways to improve air pollution such as banning the factories that emit toxic fumes."
10547,Do you agree or disagree that always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people?,"I strongly disagree that being honest is the most important thing taken into account of the relationships between people. The main reason is that there are some situations where it's better for us to tell 'white lies' for good intentions. In addition, other virtues besides honesty would also be crucial to me to judge a relationship. Ċ To begin with, telling the truth, to some extent, would be hurtful in the relationship between friends. As a friend, I'd like to give my compliment to one of my sensitive friend on her new painting. Not only because she merely takes up her painting course not long ago, but also I think 'truth' may hurt her feelings. (I don't know what's next to write after this example) Ċ Secondly, telling lies sometimes brings people hope and inspiration. A recent research conducted by a college in Berlin suggests that patients who keep depressed about their conditions have less than 9.7 percent chances to recover from the illness. Believe it or not, a doctor would be better to say something good to his patients. (I don't know what's next to write after this example) Ċ Finally, as far as l concerned, being altruistic and considerate is the important consideration for me to judge a relationship. I would be feel comfortable with someone who are likely to take my feeling into account. Ċ People tell 'white lies' from time to time for some good intention. Overall, I consider other virtues more important in an relationship than telling the truth."
10548,Some people think that the government should take care of disadvantaged people such as unemployment or home lees. Do you agree? helping people with special needs,"Although, some people may argue, others believe that homeless and unemployment people should receive help from the government. In my opinion, I agree that disadvantaged people merit an opportunity to improve themselves as it will greatly benefit both individuals and society. Ċ A good reason for the government to help needed people is the chance which everybody deserves as a country citizen. In other words, everybody has up and downs, and the state should intervene and help people who need it the most. As a result, not only the society will have more people who can contribute to its development, but also this will be a great example for other people and especially children to be compassionate, kind, supportive to people in disadvantaged situations. As a result, this phenomenon gives people whether they are rich or poor equal rights, and make them be there for each other. Ċ Another point to consider for helping people with especially needs is the decreasing risk of crime and robbery. For example, if the disadvantaged population will get help from the state they will won't have to still food or money to survive. Consequently, children will feel safe walking on the streets when their parents are not around. Furthermore, a clean and safe city is more attractive for tourists or local people to enjoy their free time. In addition, students who are looking for a job will have more time to search and find the best fit for them. Therefore, the contribution they may bring for the company is much higher considering that they are truly passionate about the work they do, and that will help the society in the long run. Ċ In conclusion, having sympathy and helping disadvantaged people will lead to a safer place to raise a family and social development."
10549,"Some educationalists argue thet non-exam arts-based subjects, such as music, drama, art and craft, should be compulsory in the secondary-school curriculum. They believe that activities such as these can improve overall academic performance.  to what extent do you agree or disagree? being an expert without learning Non-scientific subjects","Everyone has their own talent, either on art, sport, or the others. That's why many people say that to be an expert one, children should put more attention on practical subject based on their aptitude, because there beliefs that is non-sense to teach children with lack of artistic talent to involve in art classes at school. In my view, I tend to agree with this notion due to several strong reason. Ċ Children will be happier to repeat the subject which they are very likely than the the others. That's why, to make them focus on one skill in particular art, it should be connected with their aptitudes. Moreover, art is emotion which need deeply imagination to create an outstanding compotion. Because of that, to be an art expert, children skill should improve at the begining of their ages. So, they will learn to feel deeply more and more. Additionaly, only person with peacefull condition who has a big possibility to design a luxury product. So, it's clear that developing skill by the aptitudes becoming so essential. Ċ In the other hand, there also artist who have a good painting, but starting to learn art in school without an art aptitude before. This is because they have a big strong-willing to try and try. Unfortunately, there only a small portion of people in the world could be like this. Ċ To sum up, it is true that there is an expert artist today who start painting and drawing without aptitudes. It means that someone's tallent can be improve by the time. But, it will be better for focusing children based on their aptitude to build up a perfect art product due to the fact that they will have a big impression on it."
10550,The topic: it can be quite difficult to learn a new language. what do you think are the most difficult aspects of learning a new language? Give reasons and examples to support your response.,"Learning a new language became a necessity in the modern life. It can be fun and exciting to be able to speak a language that is different from the mother language; however, with learning a new language there is a lot of difficulties that one has to overcome. Some of these difficulties are: Ċ First of all, being grammatically correct. Not only it is hard to learn the grammar of a totally different language from your own, but it is also tough to be able to distinguish the grammatical differences between the two languages; i.e., grammatical phenomenon that exist in one language doesn't mean that it exist in another one. For instance, the grammatical rules in the Arabic language differ significantly from that of the English language. For one thing, Arabic has more than ten different pronouns, whereas, English has only few. Ċ Not to mention, the Syntax, this means how the words are arranged to create a well-formed sentence. The formation of a phrase can differ greatly from one language to another; wrong order of words leads to incorrect or deviated sentences. Add to that a few grammatical errors, and the sentence won't make sense at all. Ċ Moreover, there is the issue that the phonetics poses. Specifically, the one about having letters that differ notably from one alphabet to another; for example: the letter ""P"" exists in English, French, German, etc.., but it doesn't exist in Arabic, which might be an issue for an Arabic student to be able to pronounce the ""P"" easily. Ċ As shown above, learning a new language is a bit tricky, because of the troublesome differences between all languages. However, once the person overcomes these problems he will master the new language in no time."
10551,"Today, more people are overweight than ever before. What in your opinion are the primary causes of this? What measures can be taken to overcome this epidemic? OVERWEIGHT, WHAT ARE THE CAUSES AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM.","Obesity has been a health problem until now. Fast food, I think, is one of the primary reasons of this problem. This essay will discuss the causes of overweight and possible solutions to solve this issue. Ċ With the increasing amount of fast food chains, coming out like mushrooms in cities, the number of people who are above their desired weight are rising too. Fast food restaurants serve high caloric and greasy snacks with carbonated drinks that can gain weight and also unhealthy to the body. As a result, more and more people become obese because of its accessibility and easy preparation. Ċ Another cause of overweight is stress. When people are stressed, they tend to relieve this by over eating. Some may even call it, stress eating. Also, because of the hustle and bustle life in the city, people forget to eat right on time or prepare healthy food which results to purchasing take-out food. Ċ The government are taking measures to stop this erratic health problem. As a popular adage goes, prevention is better than cure. By spreading awareness and education people to a healthy lifestyle, this can help the public to avoid unnecessary food intake and practice healthy living such as promoting exercise and activities that can lose weight. Moreover, a healthy lifestyle can reduce the feeling of stress, by having enough energy for work, physically and mentally, thus, hitting two birds with one stone. Ċ All things considered, taking care of one's health should be on top of the list. Overweight is a problem that must be eradicated as soon as possible. To overcome this, awareness, with a combination of action to a healthy lifestyle should be practiced."
10552,At present the media affects people's lives significantly. What impact does this have on the society? Is it a negative or a positive development?,"It is irrefutable that the mass media has changed considerably people's lifestyle is of crucial significance. It is a highly debated issue whether people follow some behaviors and manners by what they watch or if it has negative implications on their attitude and lifestyle. Both situations have their own pros and cons which I shall discuss in this essay. Ċ Mass media can change many aspect of people's lifestyle. Individuals are interested in following some famous actors' behavior and style, which make them to feel chic and fashion. This trend among individuals changes citizens' appearances. They become similar to each other. What is more, people' knowledge about healthy lifestyle may increase considerably. Various programs are shown about how to do different daily tasks that will not have any health problems in the future. This programs sometimes invite doctors and experts to give adults a great deal of tips. Ċ Moreover, media has several positive effects on people. First, the news programs show various events around the world. Being curious about war and natural disaster is a good points for audiences. Second, the news introduces some big national events. Therefore, citizens by knowing about these events such as president voting, people feel belonging to one nation. Third, media is entertaining with some interesting films and serials. Citizens can watch some amazing films in spare time without spending huge amount of money. Ċ In the final analysis, the mass media effects people' lifestyle and changes their attitudes, which can help citizens to live better, because adults are aware of wide range knowledge and events."
10553,"More and more media attention is paid to famous people. These are the people from ordinary backgrounds and become famous in music, fashion and sports. Why do you think the public is interested in the lives of famous people? Is it right for the media to put attention on lives of famous people?","Recent years have witnessed an increasing attention is given to those celebrities by the media to cater to the taste and curiosity of the public. From my perspective, such practice exerts undesirable impacts on the daily life of celebrities to a large extent. Ċ There is no single reason has contributed to the climbing trend of excessive exposure to the lives of famous people. First and foremost, those renowned people in music, fashion and sport areas, who came from normal backgrounds, prospered through their hard-work or talents. The news arouses the interests of ordinary people who also dream to be distinguished in the future, therefore, to get an insight of the lifestyle of their idols. Apart from this, the every day lives of normal people are generally simple and dreary. Therefore, the interesting scoop about celebrities could entertain their lives. Ċ Nevertheless, it is unethical for the media to pay too much attention to digging news about celerities, which inevitably impedes their human rights. This practice put the overall soundness of celebrities in jeopardy, in both physical and psychological. The growing incidence of celebrities' suicide served as a convicing illustration. Their death are attributed to the closely chasing of the paparazzi, who did not give them a break. In light of this, excessive reports of these famous people are considered to be wrong, as it violates the personal privacy, which is supposed to be respected and protected. Ċ In conclusion, the reasons for the increasingly exposed the lives of celebrities are manifold. This practice has largely disturbed the lives of popular people."
10554,some people believe that travelling alone is the best way to experience a country or culture.others feel that it is better to travel with people you know.Discuss both views and give your opinion,"Is travelling experience best when travelled alone or in a group? This is the issue often argued.From the perspective of travelling alone,it provides freedom on contrary ,to travel in a group which is economical .This essay shall discuss both views .I am in the opinion that travelling in a group is beneficial. Ċ On the one hand, people who favour exploring places singly,claim that it will be comfortable in addition to having freedom . There will not be any restrictions at the visit.Moreover, a single person can communicate with the locals and create rapport easily than the masses.For Example, A solo visitor will be easily invited to know about the customs of a place by a local to his or her home.Hence, many tourists who want their privacy and do not want any interference from others will wish to be on a solo journey. Ċ On the other hand, human beings are social animals and will enjoy with people around them.Moreover, voyaging in groups will be economical .For instance, when in group journey expense,hotel room cost etc will be shared and will not be a burden on one person.What's more,people can share their experiences and will have company.Therefore, I believe the mass journey is beneficial .,Furthermore we can have lifelong memories as we develop close bonding during the trip. Ċ In conclusion, single visitors enjoy their privacy and freedom while mass travelling will be cost-effective and people can have company.However, I m in favour of travelling in a group."
10555,some peope think that spending a lot of money on birthdays and marriages celebrations is a waste of money but others think that it is important to the young people and the society. discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is generally believed that expending ample of fund on occasions such as the birthdays and marriages is a misuse of the monetary funds. Although this view is favoured by the younger generation and some parts of the society, others have a counter argument that it is a waste of hard-earned resources. In my opinion, I believe that overspending money on such events will make the individuals under debt, while the occasions can be celebrated with the family and friends in a sophisticated and precise way. Ċ On the one hand, many think it is unwanted to through the money on the celebrations, which is commemorated with great pomp and show. This trend has laid the wastage of many resources, and the youngsters are under debt. For instance, high expectations of the society and to maintain affluent status, 65 percent of the individuals are under stress and depression owing to repaying of the credit notes. Furthermore, under the influence of the peers’ individuals has to make such celebrations at their end to meet with expectations. Thus, it is evident that spending a handsome amount of fund on such events renders them contentment and compassion. Ċ On the other hand, spending a lot of money on such occasion should be avoided by contributing the same amount to the poor and the poverty stricken persons. This trend can save the funds and help the ones who do not get the food to eat. For an illustration, a survey conducted recently has revealed that the 25 percent of the generation is now opting for simple, sophisticated and eco-friendly ceremonies. Hence, the contribution should be made to make the poor people happy instead of draining money to show off. Ċ To conclude, I strongly opine that societal behaviour of celebrations is totally in the hands of the individuals, the expending should be made judiciously on such occasions to utilise the monetary resources judiciously and to mitigate the debt cases."
10556,"It is sometimes said that people should be encouraged to get married before Ċ they are 30, as this is best both for the individual and for society. Ċ Do you agree or disagree? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ Write at least 250 words.","In contemporary life, the reduction of population in developed countries is considered as the consequence of the low rate of marriages. There has been an increasing idea that it is better for people under the age of 30 to marry which brings benefits to personal life and society. In my perspective, I strongly agree with the statement and the essay will explain the major reasons and provide relevant examples. Ċ On the one hand, establishing a family before 30 years old is reasonable. First and foremost, that is definitely the golden time for giving birth; according to scientific researches, several experiments show the elder of women have pregnant the higher proportion of down syndrome for their offsprings. Indeed, having a family in this age group would raise the desire to mature and develop their careers in order to be the best pattern for their children. Hence, those responsible people will try their best to enhance their living standards which significantly boost the movement of the whole country. Ċ On the other hand, the family pressure is undeniable for young adults in certain features. In modern life, ambitious youngsters usually dream to pursue achievements in their passions. In other words, those dreams might stop for a long period of time after the wedding, especially with females who have to sacrifice their ambition and fall to take a noble responsibility as mothers. In terms of breadwinners, the financial problem is a huge issue with a new nuclear family without reliable supports for relatives. Luckily, the governments lay a hand to support this situation such as free education in public school, huge discount in medical care for both mom and kid. Ċ In conclusion, the advantages of getting married before 30 years old are appealing including the maturity of attitude and supporting the country's development. However, the sacrifice is considerable which needs to gain the attention of extended family and society."
10557,Some people say that cooking food at home is a waste of time. They claim that good restaurants are better and can make modern living easier and less stressful. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"I disagree with the viewpoint that fast food makes our life easier and reduces the pressure. This essay will further explain how junk foods create more health problems and are more costly than the homemade cuisine. Ċ First and foremost, consuming junk meal on a regular basis helps to create various diseases. That is to say, fast foods like burger, chips and sandwiches sold in the market may not have enough calories and nutrients which are required for a body. In addition to that, no one knows the quality of the meal and its freshness, and also may contain various preservatives and chemicals. To make mater worse consuming such foodstuff they create diseases like heart attack, blood pressure and obesity. For example, according to the survey conducted by one of the Australian researchers, 80% of obesity is caused by consuming fast foods. Ċ Likewise, regular habit of eating a conventional meal outside costs an arm and a leg. In another way, daily spending of a couple of dollars to eat outside will end up with the huge amount in a week. However, that amount can be used to serve the whole family for the month in a hygienic environment. For instance, University of India has revealed that 80% of money can be saved by preparing dishes at home rather than going in cuisines. Ċ In conclusion, some people believe that eating in restaurants makes their lives easier and less stress, but it gives rise to lots of health problems and diseases, and it is more expensive in comparison to preparing dishes at home."
10558,"Every day, millions of tons of food are wasted all over the world. Why do you think this is happening? And how can we solve this problem? identifying the reasons of food waste","In recent years, food waste has been becoming an emerging issue around the world. Given that the problem causes some significant environmental impacts, identifying the reasons is key to finding the solutions. Ċ There are a number of reasons why this issue exists. First, a large of leftovers are thrown out into the environment every day over the world. as a result, this food can not disintegrate themselves, which contribute to global warming. Second, since each type of food has its own expiry date, after this date, food become inedible, they need to be disposed of. In fact, if people try to eat this food, they would get food poisoning, which makes them have to go to the hospitals. Ċ However, there are also a variety of solutions to diminish this problem. First, governments and corporations can produce other productions from food waste to use for many other better purposes. For instance, some nations have taken steps to turn organic materials from food waste into biogas, generating electrical power at very low cost. Second, by raising awareness of people about the food usage, it can improve this problem. For instance, if a person knows how to use food properly, he or she can decrease the leftover. Ċ In conclusion, even though food waste seems serious in today' s world, there are various ways to recycle it. Raising awareness and generating energy can be two of the most useful ways to tackle food waste."
10559,"Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Vehicle technology is advancing rapidly and cars that drive themselves have already been developed. In the near future, most people will use driverless cars","In this day and age, transportation play a vital role. With the development in technology, it is applied in automotive industry. Many numerous schemes are carried out in order to innovate for various users, especially in self-driving auto. From my perspective, i entirely agree that driverless cars will be used widespread in near future. Ċ Primarily, one of the major reasons which encourage the invention of driverless cars is the safety of passengers. It is believed that driver try to lie them in cabs fee. Besides, adults want to guarantee the carefulness of their childrens. For instance, people in my country especially parents always worried about their kids if they are alone with stranger, thus, the self-driving car is a effective solution to mitigate this problem. Moreover, using virtual driver contribute to reduce stress for many drivers when they have to concentrate for a long period. Ċ Additionally, traffic congestion is also eased in certain aspect. For the public transport, driverless cars will be arranged in a contemporary system which manage vehicle logically and rigorously. As a result, transportation can be distributed reasonably especially in rush-hour. Individuals who use own driverless cars have to pay a large charge to maintain the uninterrupted operation. Whereby, public transports are well-received because of the saving and the convenience. It is also followed by reducing CO2 emissions. Ċ In conclusion, it is indisputable fact that technology has creates a revolution in all fields of life. Driverless car is a ground-breaking in the auto manufacturing industry which can improve our life quality. The faster technology is advanced, the more driverless cars are developed."
10560,television dominates the free-time of too many people. it can make people lazy and prevent them from socialising with others. do you agree or disagree?,"Television has been the most popular choice of many people to enjoy their leisure time. As a consequence, people have become more indolent and they are no longer socialising with others. I strongly agree with this opinion. Ċ To begin with, concerning the matter of individuals are getting lazier because of watching television excessively, it is a fact that if years ago people used to use their free time with outdoor activities, nowadays being in front of the screen is the most convenient choice for the majority. For example, people have a busy lifestyle and are unable to take the time to go out for any kind of entertainment. In addition, the innumerable channels and programmes available are very attractive. Therefore, people tend to be home watching their favourites programmes. This behaviour gives rise to laziness which might also lead to health problems. Ċ It must also be pointed out that television means being indoors most of the time and no social activity is involved. For instance, I remember that in my childhood I used to spend my free time doing sports or socialising with my friends. However, nowadays children are more and more addicted to television, which leads to them turning into introverts and losing social skills. Ċ In conclusion, taking these factors into consideration, I am inclined to believe that television has made people physically inactive as well as limited their social skills. Although other factors such as the Internet contribute to this behaviour, the popularity of television is one of the main causes."
10561,"Some people believe that studying abroad is important because it expands a person's knowledge and understanding of the world. Others feel that it is better to study at home because that is the best way to prepare for a career in the student's own country. Discuss both these views, and give your opinion.","Overseas education has become widely renowned in today's globalized world. There are numerous reasons which motivate students to pursue their studies abroad. Although some argue that studying in a homeland can be more beneficial, I strongly believe in attaining a foreign degree will be more advantageous. This essay examines both the perspectives and concluded with my opinion. Ċ On one hand, pursuing overseas studies broaden the opportunities for one's career. Also, it is a chance for anyone to understand and mingle with different customs and cultures. To illustrate, my close friend visited the homeland after his first-year majors from an international university and his parents were elated by the way their son has transformed with good qualities such as patient listening and respecting others. Thus, it is evident that the more we get exposed to the world, the better we mature. Ċ While on the other hand, it is undeniable that it has some demerits as well, like a distraction from studies and get abused to drugs, etc. For example, one of my cousins has spoiled his career by addicting to consuming excessive alcohol. Consequently, he failed to complete his masters. Admittedly, this is alarming to see students ruining their career with such addictions. Ċ All in all, studying abroad has enormous merits provided that have to be followed by certain rules and regulations. However, it is up to us to decide whether to opt for the right direction or to get addicted to unwanted distractions. Finally, it is evident that following the right direction will lead to success though it is difficult to travel."
10562,prevention is better than cure The prevention of health problems and illness is more important than treatment and medicine. Government funding should reflect this. To what extent do you agree?,"As for health issues, some people argue that prevention is better than cure, so governments should allocate more funds on preventive measures. Personally, I strongly agree with these views. Ċ One of the primary cause is that prevention is the only way to dealing with many diseases for which no cure has been found. The concept of prevention represents opportunities to avoid many diseases if we take proactive steps before a problem forms. For many uncurable diseases like tobacco-related cancer, patients have to count down the rest of their life when receiving the result of a cancer diagnosis. In this regard, research shows that smoking makes cancers more likely, so doctors urge people to stop is an indispensable step to help them prevent it. Thus, perhaps prevention plays more significant impacts for many incurable diseases. Ċ Apart from the argument above, I also believe that it is realistic that government spend more funds on the prevention than the cure. Medical system using public funding is impossible to afford all people's demands concerning treatment and medicine. It is costly to buy effective drugs, and facilities and equipment also come at a massive cost to the government. By contrast, it is manifestly cheap that governments spend money on launching campaigns to encourage a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise. So there are manifested benefits to government spending on prevention. Ċ In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that influence by prevention is higher than cure. Therefore, there are reasonable arguments that require more funs on the prevention."
10563,"some people believe that the internet has brought people closer together by making world smaller. others disagree, claiming that the internet has made people and communities more isolated because they no longer need to leave home and interact with others. Ċ Discuss both the view and give your opinion.","Development of technology has changed human lives. The internet is one of the most innovative inventions of telecommunication. At the viewpoint, of some people, the internet has brought people closer, while others are of diverse opinion. Before presenting my view, I intend to examine both sides of the argument. Ċ Advocates of the web suggest that, it has managed to bring the citizens of the world closer by providing several means of communication. Not only, has it made it feasible for friends and family members to connect with each other conveniently, but also, has made it cheaper. To cite an example, thanks to the net, one can chat or video call with anyone, residing in any part of the world, merely through clicking a button.In addition to this, it has enabled businesses, to operate globally through websites, which has brought professionals closer. For instance, there are numerous online sites, where one can find a pro in any field ranging from a doctor to a lawyer. Ċ On the other hand, the cyberspace has made the society antisocial. More and more human beings today, prefer online tools to maintain relationships with pals, instead of meeting face to face. Furthermore, this trend has resulted in people suffering from mental disorders such as anxiety and depression, due to isolation as well as loneliness. An illustration of this is, a survey conducted by WHO in 2015, depicted that the number mental health patients have been surging up, since the advent of socialising apps. Ċ To conclude, the web has provided paths, for societies, all round the planet to stay connected. However, it has administered solitude among people too. In my opinion, if proper precautions are taken, it can prove to be a boon for the humanity, and help convert the earth into a global village."
10564,"Healthy food education, is it necessary? Scientists agree that people are damaging their health by eating too much junk food. Some people think that the answer to this problem is to educate people. Others think education will not work. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is believed that people are suffering from loads of health-related issues because of excessive consumption of unhealthy food. Some people hold the thought that education should take responsibility for this phenomenon while others have little faith in this solution. This essay contends that education is such an applicable solution, and it will discuss both points of view. Ċ On the one hand, educating people and raising their awareness towards the hazard of unwholesome food are believed to yield some auspicious outcomes. Firstly, general education can provide people with adequate knowledge of nutrition and food safety. As a result, people would have the competence to distinguish between domestic commodities and junk food which contain lots of detrimental substances. Secondly, knowledge of health-related issues seems beneficial to encourage healthy habits. People would have a nourishing diet if they have opportunities to take part in some extracurricular activities like cooking with healthy ingredients. Ċ On the other hand, it is suspicious that health education is not a one-size-fits-all solution because of the following reasons. To begin with, nobody can deny that junk food has its own good characteristics. For instance, hamburgers or pizzas are considered the best choices for their convenience and delicious tastes while it seems to be time-consuming to prepare for a proper nutritious meal. In addition, some people who experience financial difficulties find it difficult to afford a three-course meal; therefore, they eat junk food on a daily basis despite being aware of its potential consequences. Ċ In conclusion, there are many different opinions about whether education could help to reduce people's consumption of fast food. In my opinion, I do believe that education can be a worthwhile measure with careful consideration of other impediments."
10565,Many young people choose to take a year out between finishing school and starting university in order to gain work experience or to travel. The experience of non-academic life this offers benefits the individual when they return to education. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is true that nowadays there are some youths who decide to take a gap year between their school and university studies to travel around or work somewhere. In my opinion, there is no hesitation that living those types of experiences has a positive impact and will benefit them while coming back to education life. Ċ On one hand, gaining some work experience before going to university can make a difference as will undoubtedly broaden your mind thus having a wider perspective when making decisions. Moreover, the possibility to meet new people and either improve or learn new skills is absolutely open-up within this scenario. For example, the fact of going to work on a farm will push the individual into the countryside lifestyle where values such as discipline, respect and effort are essential. As a consequence, it is simply true that a need to thrive and keep forward to better adapt yourself to the unknown environment will urge. Ċ On the other hand, in my view, travelling abroad certainly enhance creativity and creates different neural pathways. By visiting different countries, a wide range of cultural information can be provided, hence gaining educational knowledge which will induce new brain connections. For instance, visiting another country and meeting someone who brings us closer to local food and nutrition, could potentially unblock our aim to discover more tastes and nutritional properties. Overall, all these experiences may be really practical to acknowledge your current interests. Ċ To conclude, I think coming to a decision on how the future should be managed by the age of eighteen might be quite tough. This is why while finishing school many people feel very lost as they do not know what studies fit them better and consequently end up choosing something in which they are not really interested . Being aware of the existence of these other possibilities can be helpful for clarifying ideas."
10566,Over consuming sugar is unhealthy. Some people think that governments should take responsibility to control it. Others think that individuals should take responsibility for sugar intake. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Eating carbohydrate in an amount more than necessary is not healthy. According to a few individuals, the state should take care of this matter.While, the rest think that people should take control of their own sugar consumption. In my opinion, I believe that everyone should keep a track of their carbohydrate intake. However, this essay will discuss both views. Ċ To begin with, the excess amount of sweetness in food items harms our energy. Likewise, if anyone is practicing this, then he is at a risk of serious well-being problems relating to heart and moreover, it leads to premature aging. Therefore, it is very important to limit sugar going inside our body. For instance, a diabetic patient should monitor and curb the carbohydrate and carbohydrates he is including in his diet and he should know the consequences of not doing so. Ċ Contrastingly, the government should also take the initiative in this matter in order to save the fitness of its citizens. Since it has the power to reach a mass crowd, it should organise awareness campaigns to create a sense among people regarding this issue. This should be done often in order to create a sense of awareness among a maximum number. For example, they can organise health programs to educate people about nutrition and obesity and the dangers it can cause. Ċ To conclude, I opine that although government should take measures to decrease the usage of this substance, I believe that it is self duty to eat well and maintain the soundness of the body."
10567,"Internet or printed news? Some people think that in the future, printed newspaper will still be the most important source of news. However, others think that news provided on the Internet will play the most important role. Discuss both views and give your opinions.","These days, opinions differ as to whether Internet or printed news will be the most crucial source of news. Some people believe printed format will retain its significance, while others think it will gradually be replaced by online news. From my standpoint, I tend to agree with the latter. Ċ It is understandable why people believe in the importance of printed format. The publishing industry has existed for hundreds of years employing millions of personnels all around the world. It is often depicted as ""too big to fall"" as the failure of such may leave some detrimental effects on any national economy. Besides, reading daily newspaper has so long been established as a die-hard habit for some. Such people adhere to the traditional form of news as they gain the distinctive joice flipping through the pages. Ċ However, I strongly believe it's the online news that makes the future of journalism. The speed of Internet is undeniably faster than ever before, facilitating live-stream coverage of sport events and music concerts. Moreover, the online multimedia platform equips journalists with ample ways to report news such as: infographics, animated videos or interactive discussion. Those creative methods can never be feasible on a printed format. Another reason to reinforce to the growth of online news is our over-reliant on the Internet. It is not an exxageration to say that we have been so inexorably linked to the Internet that it is hard to live without it. Online articles, news that spread through various platform of the Internet, will surely benefit from this trend. Ċ In conclusion, although there are evidences to suggest traditional newspaper is still favoured, I strongly believe online format will be the most important source of news in the future."
10568,Q. Not enough students around the world choose to study science subjects at university. What are the reasons for this? What impacts does this issue have on society?,"Amidst an overwhelming array of hundreds of programs in university, it is noticeable that just a small proportion of students would like to pursue a science degree. This essay will highlight the contributing factors as well as the consequences of this trend posed to society in the coming future. Ċ Not like a career-oriented degree, studying science is considered as an interest without a clear end goal. It is undeniable that many graduates with business or engineering-related degree are more capable of securing a job with a competitive salary and a better career development. Graduates from Science School, however, are often struggling to land a job upon graduation. For example, there is only a limited range of jobs with low starting salary for biology students such as research assistant and laboratory assistant. This may affect the willingness of students to choose a subject with a higher competitive edge. Secondly, lack of support to the industry is another reason behind. There is no denying the fact that not enough resources and money have been allocated from the government to the science field in order to support several researches. Consequently, this may trigger many talents to lose interest in joining or staying in the field. Ċ The results of getting not enough scientists are tremendous, not only put our future generation in jeopardy, but also hinder the discovery of several scientific theories. The number of scientists may drop significantly and the new inventions fall correspondingly. It is worth mentioning that the swift development of society requires the assistant of technology, which highlight the importance of presence of scientists. Artificial Intelligence, for instance, is certainly essential to reduce the cost of operation in some social activities. Ċ To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that limited resources distribution to science development and money-orientated society are the main causes of this phenomenon, which might lead to a negative result in the society."
10569,Many of the world's children consume far too much unhealthy food. What are the causes of this problem and what can be done to solve it?,"Unhealthy food consuming among children is a tragedy of the present age. The problem is best explained by parents' influences and the development of food industries, but can be alleviated by changing children's attitudes toward food and placing tight regulations on junk food marketing. Ċ It is difficult to argue with the idea that parents play a strong role in their children's eating habits. Due to work circumstances, people routinely resort to unhealthy eating options. Parents are more likely to skip cooking family meals and feed their children with take-out meals or prepared entrees. As a result, children follow their parents' patterns. Another reason for children yearning for junk food is excessive pampering by the parents and always allowing children to have their ways in consuming junk food. Ċ Junk food advertising is also a culprit for the obesity and bad eating diets among children. As food companies spend more to promote their food on social media, children tend to see more food ads. The main issue of most viewing junk food ads is that it depicts junk food in a delicious and tantalizing form which acts as boosters for increasing appetite for them. Ċ The best way to deal with the regrettable situation at hand is to train children about food and their eating habits. If children are taught properly, they are more likely to make healthy food choices and minimize the intake of junk food themselves as well. Parents also need to try cooking regularly at home and serving home-made meals. Another measure is that a ban on junk food during peak children's viewing times should be applied."
10570,"Some teachers prefer to record the lecture in advance so that students can familiarize themselves with it first, and practice what they have learned from the lecture in the class. Do you consider this is a good way to teach?","In contemporary, it is convenient for modern people to use techniques to work. The professors and teachers also benefit from advanced technology. So some of the earnest teachers would like to help students preview their classes before starting. Using some ways to benefit students to study from the videos they record. However, in my perspective, I don't think it is effective for most of the students in school. Ċ To begin with, it is impractical for all the students to watch the previewing lecture before classes. If only some of the students have taken the previewed videos, the class' students will have a degree gap after the class started. The more classes they take, the bigger the gap gets. A good course and a good teacher demand to make the whole class to get a better level after the course ends up. Ċ Furthermore, it is unnecessary to put more pressure on the students' backs. Nowadays, students get a lot of courses and homework from school. Most of the teachers put much pressure on them. They study in school and doing homework after school. Giving an extra video lecture for homework is going to take the leisure time they merely have. Ċ By the way, if the students are interested in the subject they study, they would like to surf the information on the internet. It is convenient for teachers to teach students with computers. Hence, it is also comfortably for students to learning information with computers. On the other hand, modern students are ""technology natives."" Morden students usually use ""Google"" to replace many sides of teachers. Ċ In light of the above arguments, I believe that is needless for teachers to record the lecture before class. It is neither efficient for students nor a good way for students to learn."
10571,Nowadays communication technology is developing rapidly; people communicate in different ways. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.,"Technology gives us a great deal of chance to communicate with people in various ways. Some people believe that modern devices have many demerits, while others have positive opinion about new ways to communicate with each others. Both situations have their own pros and cons which I shall discuss in this essay. Ċ To begin with, technology provides many gadgets to communicate. By increasing the use of computers, many software programs are developed to chat. People can see and speak with each other simultaneously. This situation increases many flexibility to communicate, for example many classes can be online, therefore, students and teachers do not have to be in the same places. Also, emerging mobiles helps people to connect without considering where they are. People can send messages to friends and families in different places including at work places, at cars or even at street. Ċ On the other hand, using electrical devices decreases face- to - face communication. In the past when people wanted to speak to each other, they had to go to other houses or places where they could visit others. However, these days individuals can stay their home and use electrical gadgets to say hello. What is more, using new electrical devices reduces people's attention to others who are around them. The tendency to speak with individuals who stay in the same places decreases considerably, since people use mobiles or ipads to speak with own friends. In restaurants or public transportations, I have seen many teenagers or adults speak by their cell phones all the time. Ċ In conclusion, technology helps people to communicate with each other very easily. audio and video communications become more popular among different people."
10572,"Some people think that fittest and strongest individual and team can achieve success in sports, while others believe that success depends on mental attitude. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In the modern world, many people are reckoned to think that the key element of success is a mental attitude, while others feel that the physical strength and well-being can lead to the prosperity. After pondering this phenomenon, I believe that the balance between the mental well-being and physical training can lead to the success. Ċ On the one hand, it is true that being strong is crucial for the sportsmen and sportswomen. In this regard, they should be well prepared to become a champion or a winner. Furthermore, many types of sports, such as wrestling, martial arts and taekwondo, require being physically strong and durable. To illustrate, ordinary people cannot run for 3 km in 12 minutes, and they should train every day in order to get this accomplished. Ċ On the other hand, the key ingredient of prosperity is mental health. In this case, sportsmen should know how to beat their opponents and counterparts. That is to say, they should plan their every step in advance. Moreover, internal health is essential for being a champion in many types of sports such as boxing, jogging and swimming. To illustrate, these kinds of sports have many emotional moments and situations. Accordingly, the people should keep their emotion in such kinds of situations in order to not show their weaknesses. Ċ In conclusion, although many people tend to think that the fittest and strongest individual can be a winner, others feel that the internal health is vital for being a champion. However, in my opinion, I believe that the people should be efficient and productive in order to beat their opponents."
10573,One of the prime times for advertising on TV is when children get back from school. Some people think that advertisements aimed at children should not be allowed. What is your opinion?,"Advertisements play a major role in influencing the buying decisions of customers. Most of these ads are aired in the evenings when children are back from school and sitting in front of the television. Some people opine that commercials targeting young kids should be banned. Therefore, I agree with this view to a great extent because in my opinion, excessively promotional ads have a devastating effect on children. Ċ Firstly, children are easily manipulated by the adverts which take them to the virtual world. As a result, which coax them to purchase products that are not always worth their money. For example, Since 2010, toys of the Star Wars series are very popular among teenagers and sales of these toys are very high in the market. Secondly, the advertisements are delivered in such a way that children start pestering their parents to buy those products. For instance, the fast food chain McDonald’s promote their Ads to attract more and more teenagers to eat fast food which is not good for health because it contains high levels of fats and cholesterol which cause obesity and diabetes in children.Thus, these adverts should not be allowed to be shown in mass media Ċ Thirdly, another reason to restrict ads is that they may even put the lives of children at risk. In other words, Children imitate the dangerous stunts performed by celebrities in commercials and often lose their life or cause themselves serious injuries because they are not aware of the consequences. Take, for example, a report conducted by the US, stated that these adverts are subconsciously shaping our shopping habits very badly. To finish, Adverts that target children, be it on TV, billboards or the internet, should be completely banned. Ċ To conclude, most ads targeting children are overly promotional and have a negative impact on children. Hence the government must ensure that they are not aired during prime time."
10574,Education is not a luxury but a basic human righ and as such should be free for everyone irrespective of personal wealth. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is true that education is not necessarily a luxury thing ,however, the space of free education should provide for all humans around the world without considering personal wealth. From my point of ,view, I strongly agree with this idea. Ċ Firstly one of the conspicuous reasons for this argument is to create appropriate opportunities for all people to receive a high-quality free education. For example countries such as Germany that have done this are often regarded by other countries. Education for all degrees is free in this country irrespective of personal wealth,economic situation and their ethnic. This would create an equal occasion for humans to reach their goals and follow their choices. This makes it clear that free education and courses are essential means to accomplish humans their basic rights. Ċ Secondly ,another significant reason for this is increasing the number of people who are literate. For instance ,when education has been free for all humans in a country the statistics of those who decide to continue their education in universities has been jumping. This would cause a dramatic advance in the worldwide literacy rate in comparison to countries that receive tuition fees. It becomes apparent that there is no reason to receive money for providing complimentary education for people. This would definitely be crucial to provide an equal opportunity education for all of the humans around the world. Ċ To summarise ,I completely believe that education is a fundamental right for all people who live in the world and should be free for the poor and rich. It is predicted that the positive effects of the debate on free education will always be greater than the adverse effects."
10575,"Due to the development of the internet, public libraries are no longer necessary. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that since the digital technologies has developed so fast that public libraries are completely redundant. I totally disagree with that point of view because public libraries are always reliable source of information and socially important for every community Ċ The First reason why public libraries are vital that it is reliable. It is irrefutable that as digital technologies are becoming advanced, more and more people became dependent on the websites which made easier the way of people’s life. Online libraries are not exception that most people use to read e-books not only to get entertained, but also for the research of their academic purposes. However, online resources cannot be used as reliable source this is because one may get unreliable data which was incorrect as the online websites are not able to filter false info, but public libraries can store the most reliable tip since the publication of books are checked thoroughly by publishers which make them more reliable than the modern web resources. As an example, the book which is called “The Lord of the Flies” by William Golding was rejected 21 times before it had been published. Hence, it seems to me that public libraries are still essential to be preserved. Ċ The second reason is that public libraries provides communication. These days the ubiquity of online platforms, particularly, social networking sites is prone to take people’s precious time, which may eventually lead to isolation from the society. While, Public libraries serve as a provision of gathering place for everyone in person. What I mean here is that if citizens interact with each other who have the same interests, they will have a sense of community. Furthermore, it is likely that the youth can improve their social skills which will definitely help them this virtue to apply for a job by attending to the libraries instead of spending their whole time on the online platform. For instance, Bill Gates have read more than 100 books in the library by dint of attending to the libraries. Thus, it does make sense to have libraries. Ċ In conclusion, Although there are some people who are of the opinion that libraries are not needed, I believe that libraries are an essential asset to provide resources which are trustworthy and to make people more sociable. Hence, It is highly advisable to keep libraries open to public."
10576,"Advocating the school system Some people feel that boarding schools are an excellent opinion for children, while others disagree for a number of reasons. consider both sides and reach a conclusion","Boarding schools have been popular among many countries since the past. there have existed endless comments on whether this kind of school is the ideal choice for students. this essay will debate both sides of this topic and reach a concluding view. Ċ Advocates of this school system would argue that this is an excellent paradigm for children to comprehensively develop. Obviously, living with peers and without parents can train kids into self-reliant, independent, confident and sociable civilians who can manage things by themselves in most situations in life as well as have a wide net of friends and better communication skill. In addition, this can also benefit busy parents having a little amount of time for their families. Saving time driving kids from home to school and back, preparing quality meals and helping kids out with loads of homework can exemplify this advantage. Ċ In contrast, there are reasons to disapprove of this syllabus. Away from family has never been easy, even with adults, let alone the premature. Without parental guidance and surveillance, children can suffer from insufficient nutriented dietary plan, as well as some can be spoiled by heinous people provoking them to take drugs, alcohol and neglect their study. Combined with peer pressure and stress gained from studying, students may find it desparate and hold a pessimistic view about life. Ċ In conclusion, although boarding school forms a brilliant environment for children's development and bring several benefits to busy parents, it appears that this school system's drawbacks outweigh its advantages as students may be disoriented during their school years."
10577,Many people make friends through social sites and chat rooms. Others believe that it is not a good idea to make friends without meeting them face to face. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Communication through the internet has become an essential part of our lives. It is common to have a pen-friend living in another country without even meeting them. A segment of society is convinced that these kinds of friendships can lead to adverse consequences. Others, however, believe the opposite. The following paragraphs will analyze both views and explain my support of the latter view. Ċ The internet makes it possible to find like-minded people and build lasting relationships. More specifically, in online group chats of certain topics, individuals have more chances to meet someone who shares their interests rather than at the workplace. Because the internet connects people from all around the world. As a result of communicating with like-minded people, individuals will less likely fall into depression and feel lonely. Moreover, it is a good opportunity for disabled people to make friends. Later, people engaged in these kinds of relationships can meet each other and become best friends or even a couple. For instance, my friend met her husband on the internet 3 years before meeting him in person. Ċ On the negative side, people are different, some may have bad intentions. For example, individuals may become victims of cyberbullying, identity or personal information theft, and etc. It is difficult to identify the bad intentions of others without seeing them. Nevertheless, I believe that vigilance and intelligence can effectively help to tackle this issue. Therefore, people should take basic precocious measures to ensure their financial, mental and physical safety. Ċ To conclude, although making friends online has some potential threats, it gives more opportunities to meet good people from other countries. People should be cautious."
10578,Some people believe that it is a good idea that older people continue to work if it is possible for them to do. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many argue that it is better if senior citizens continue to employ themselves even after the retirement age if they are capable of it. I completely agree with this opinion and think that this will aid to the national income of the nation and elderly people will have enough funds to spend on their well-being and earn living. Ċ Firstly, if the old community performance even in their old age, they will contribute to the economic growth of the country by way of paying taxes. For example, they will be a less burden on the government and also on their families as they can look after themselves with the salaries they will earn. Not only that, the expert work advice helps the new employees to learn their job. Therefore, they are the total asset to the country. Ċ Secondly, when people reach their retirement age, they undergo stress and become emotional. However, continuing to work even after a certain age keeps their mind busy and help them to forget their worries. A survey conducted by Indian Aaj tak revealed that individuals who do not leave jobs after 65 years of age have a high life expectancy than the ones who resign their job at retirement age. Hence keeping themselves busy at work leads to the advantage of good health and happiness in elderly people's lives. Ċ To conclude, it depends on several factors whether a person wants to continue working or wants to spend time with families at an older age. From my perspective, I strongly feel that it's the best option for older people to carry on working if they have the ability to do so. If this trend goes on then both the elderly and society will benefit from this."
10579,"Research has shown that the transportation of products and people are the main source of pollution. Some people believe the Government should be in charge of this, while others believe it is the fault of individuals. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","According to studies, the primary source of pollution is the transportation of goods and people. While some believe the government should be in charge, others consider that it is the responsibility of individuals. In this essay, I will discuss both views and state my opinion. Ċ On the one hand, people who put the blame on the government may cite the carelessness in collecting data on how polluted the environment is due to all kinds of transportation as the main reason. Indeed, by collecting and publicizing it, the citizens can be aware of the risk that the entire nation has to face. Additionally, when analyzing the statistics of pollution, the government can also come up with proper strategies. For instance, if there is a great amount of carbon dioxide released into the air, then a reduction in vehicles is required. Ċ On the other hand, although it is partly the fault of the government, it is undeniable that this escalating issue is closely related to individual consciousness. Specifically, the government’s remedies will be useless without the coordination of people, which means that the people must follow the government’s lead in order to address this problem. Take Japan as a prime example, when the encouragement of using public transport came into effect, a majority of citizens then took the buses and subways in lieu of private vehicles. Consequently, Japan is now a country with the lowest emission in the world. Ċ In conclusion, there is no doubt the government plays a crucial role in solving the environmental pollution problems. However, the population’s consciousness is also equally pivotal."
10580,There are many people who go to live in different countries. To what extent should people be allowed to move freely between countries and live where they choose? What are the benefits and drawbacks of this? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is currently a contentious argument over whether immigrants should be permitted to shift between different nations with no restrictions. In this essay, I will examine some advantages related to this as spreading cultural diversity as well as the downsides like lack of safety. Then I will explain why I believe that country immigration restrictions should be tightened. Ċ Admittedly, to accept any individual to a particular country helps to flourish its diversity. Accordingly to some governments having open immigration politics make their peoples' average age raises. Therefore, there being no restrictions to immigrants can allow these countries to develop themselves, thereby, they could take advantage of this subject. For instance, countries that have the majority of ageing people like Italy, Spain and suchlike would be able to stand for their next generations. Ċ On the other hand, there is a drawback that far outweighs any benefit which is peoples' safety. Some countries had already tried this measure of the open border to anyone which did not end well. Thus, when a nation accepts anyone to land across the border without previous background checking it would certainly open doors to terrorism or international diseases. To illustrate, most cases os terrorism around the world in the last decades were triggered by individuals in countries with low restrictions as France, Italy and German. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that any country should have strict regulations when it comes to accepting people from other countries, especially in regards to immigrants mostly because of the country safe. However, it is also a truism to say that diversity helps different nations to survive in the years to come."
10581,Some people think modern technology is making people more sociable while others think that real life interaction is better. Discuss both views and give your opinion. social interaction switch from real to virtual world,"Nowadays people started to switch their social interaction from real world to virtual world, which have impacted the way we socialize with each other. Ċ First of all, technology began to create social virtual platforms for people to communicate and exchange information rapidly. By interacting with persons all around the world in one second, virtual social networks started to be more effective and easier to use. However, real-world social life is practical in the side of effectiveness and time managing, for example, if I want to ask the boss to clarify the new project for me, I will easily call him and ask him. Scientifically speaking, a research paper published in Harvard University's press shows that 90% of worker choose email to talk with their partener rather than real life communication. In conclusion, technology started to make us more close to each other, and makes the social interaction faster. Ċ Secondly, real life social interaction is fruitful in the level of human contact, which means, when we go outside and talk to people, friends or family, we are creating a deep social link with other. Moreover, Taking in mind that a huge part of our communication in nonverbal, real human interaction is more powerful because it makes us understand and feel each other deeply. Furthermore, researchers suggest that a strong social network provide us with a healthy relationships, which strongly makes our life longer by making us more and more happier. Ċ In my opinion, I feel that healthy life matters. Real social interaction makes us more sociable and strongly connected with each other."
10582,Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree ? Inhumane and Absurd Capital Punishment,"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept. Ċ First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled. Ċ Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away. Ċ The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system. Ċ In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence."
10583,"Although most people are richer than in the past, modern life seems very stressful, and the number of people suffering from stress is at record levels. Ċ What are the main causes of stress in modern life, and how could stress be reduced?","Stress is a ubiquitous phenomenon in today's society and everyone suffers through it as compared to the past, even people are more affluent in these days thenconjunction used in comparativesthan the past, still their lives are too complicated. An unexpected increase in individual's desires, expectations and busy lifestyle are the primary causes. By utilising time and keep unwanted desires in control could be the main solutions of this unfortunate dilemma. The essay will further discuss both facets of a proposal with appropriate examples reaching to a logical conclusion. Ċ To begin with, our enhanced desires are the main cause of it in our life because when a person starts thinking to achieve more goals to be wealthy, after that he or she start putting burden on their mind, and that excruciating pressure could cause an intense strain. Additionally a busy daily routine generates the stressful situation too in one's life, while working for long hours one would not spare a time for exercise that creates a physical and emotional burden. These both reasons are interrelated to each other. While focusing on desires a person forgets to take care of their self. For example, according to various studies, our ancestors hunting for food only and their lifespans have been usually longer and without any types of diseases, but in today's era, people run behind a plethora of things, that made their lives indirectly worse. Ċ On the other hand, there are lots of possible solutions of it, first of all persons should focus on necessary and approachable things, by doing it their mind releases an extra tension. However, they should allocate their time for an exercise to feel fresh and energetic for a whole day. Even though extra curriculum activities can reduce the pressure from one's mind and finally, a person should meditate every day because it mitigate the atrocious effect of stress from the brain. For instance, a study conducted in the UK, showed that people tend to be healthier by exercising and meditating each day, other than, people who are not doing any kinds of exercises. Ċ In conclusion, it is absolutely true that modern growth brings more stress for humans that produce horrible Troma, but still, it depends on us too that how we manage things to be stress free and relax. Therefore, various solutions exist to ameliorate these drawbacks, nevertheless an indefinite solution yet to be found."
10584,Too many old historic buildings are in danger and destroyed in many countries. What are the main reason? How to protect them?,"As the development of modernization, ancient buildings are gradually disappearing around the world. They were the places where containing stories in the past. However, number of reasons that lead to people destroy those historic buildings. Ċ First of all, historic buildings are not safe for people live in anymore. The frame of ancient buildings could be corrupted by various weathers, mice or worms. Especially for those wooden stairs in old buildings, they were weak when people step on the wooden pieces. In additionally, historic buildings rarely have fire alarm system. Fire event is most likely happening in these high risk buildings. Ċ Moreover, ancient buildings are obstacles in the development of modern cities. There is a continuous mitigation of urban planning. Roads are broaden due to the significant increase of car uses.

Does Advertising Force People to Buy Things They Don't Need?,"Nowadays, many famous things have been selling out just because of the advertisement, even there are such kind of things included which is not necessary for the society, this writing will examine the both side of the issue, Ċ I can endorse my proposition with the help of the following reasons that, well known equipment sales have been went up recent years with the help of the advertisement. There is no doubt advertisers mostly attack on the children and then children put pressure on parents to buy them things. For example, burger, biscuit and chocolates have reached at the high stage of the selling, behind of this phenomenon there is a hand of the expert advertisers as well as they make some attractive adds and then show it on the television. Ċ On the other hand, some unwanted and vulnerable things are also part of the famous sales in the market. Fore example, there are some local or international companies in the market those are investing million dollars for advertise their clothes, laptops,mobile phones and more other things by posting on the roads and using the internet websites. Ċ Furthermore, such as companies use the well known and successful people to make the add. For example, they use actors, actresses for the advertisement. Ċ So eventually, in the light of the above stated fact we reach to a concrete and conclusive paragraph by saying that, there is a big hand of the advertisement behind of the unnecessary things, and in my opinion I advertiser can use this tool but not for faq or incredible things."
10586,Eating a balanced diet is the most important factor for a healthy life. To what extent do you agree? every individual should develop a habit of eating healthy,"Our eating habits greatly affect our lifestyle. It is said, that for a healthy life eating a balanced food is crucial. In my view, negligence in eating can lead to health problems and diseases, which ultimately badly affects the lifestyle of people. Ċ Undoubtedly, trend of eating fast food is profoundly prevailing these days. Especially youngsters are eating more junk food, which leads to non-curable diseases such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes. This is because youngsters prevent themselves from the hassle of cooking. Moreover, due to busy lifestyle, people do not have time for cooking and they do not even take proper meals, which, therefore, is immensely affecting them by making them weak and deficient of important nutrients. Hence, due to poor diet habits people are becoming prone to unhealthy conditions and diseases. Ċ Admittedly, consuming fresh, nutrient rich and healthy food makes an individual healthy and he can obviously lead a better lifestyle as compare to people following bad eating habits. Ċ For instance, a person eating food containing all essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats and proteins would definitely be getting adequate nutrition and will be less likely to suffer from disease conditions. In addition, he will stay active and healthy. So balanced food is vital as it aids to maintain a healthy life. Ċ In conclusion, People eating food with inadequate nutrients are at greater risk of carrying diseases while individuals consuming healthy food with equal proportions of necessary nutrients can enjoy a healthy life. Therefore, I totally agree with the fact that every individual should develop a habit of eating a balanced diet as it guarantees you a better life."
10587,Recently published figures show that the wildlife population around the world has decreased by around fifty percent over the last fifty years. What can we do to help protect the wildlife around the world? faunae and florae population have been decreasing,"Wildlife population has been diminishing around fifty percent, according to recent public research, in comparison to the last fifty years. In order to secure animal species, plants, fungi or other organisms in an enormous scales, the municipal government ought to publish hunting and fishing law as well as encourage people to plant more trees and forests to prevent the wildlife from being detrimental. Ċ Illegal hunting and fishing should have been strictly monitoring, by issuing the law to which it pertains. It might thwart smugglers from smuggling products abroad lawlessly because this must have lead to fatalistic consequences, the wildlife population diminishing. Currently, some countries are conducting this law such as Canada, the US, or many Europe countries. Individuals who violate the law, are withdrew hunting or fishing license and banned from those activities for a few years. Ċ Besides, environment recreation is believed to have been an immediate solution so that plenty of wildlife's homes could be saved sufficiently because forests and trees are the home base for most animals and plants. Nature disasters such as volcano eruption, flooding, fire, or human activities including farming, demolish the home of fauna and flora ubiquitously. These species lost their homes and were unable to survive which triggers the declining of population scales, as an inevitable result. Hence, planning to grow forests, trees, and plants, at which it was devastated, are a contemporary paramount method. Ċ In conclusion, wild faunae and florae population have been decreasing every year, so humans should protect it strictly by monitoring a law to prevent hunting and fishing illegally and build many forests and plants."
10588,"There is a such tendency in the world that wealthier nations aids to poorer and underdeveloped nations as financial ,food,educational aids etc...In the times of crises ,revolutions and dissatisfaction the question always arises that why do rich countries not help the poor? Why do they not share their wealth to make the world a better place to live?","Citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings and we are all living together in one world so we cannot be careless about the situation of people in poor countries. In a globalizing world all nations become more dependent on each other.Problems which have occurred in poorer countries are spreaded and influence to others and this in turn becomes a more global problem.Such humanitarian aids prevent mass migrations and future civil wars from this part of world. Ċ At the same time supported countries may be turn to one of the biggest consumer of wealthier nations .This in turn can be considered as strategical aid. Ċ On the other hand these supported countries must seek ways for development and become independent from other countries' money.For instance: Austria and Japan had been financed after World War Second for reconstruction and development of destroyed countries under the Europian Recovery Program which had been created by the government of USA and better known as the Marshall plan.In the result of these countries' determination , at present, they are well- developed countries . Ċ All facts considered,I think that wealthier nations should help poorer nations but only by letting them help themselves. Teach them how to grow crops instead of just giving them food, show them how to get clean water supplies instead of just sending them trucks of water, and to try opening dialogues with their governments on how to improve their school systems. As the proverb says 'Give a man a fish, he has lunch for a day. Teach a man to fish, he has lunch everyday.' In my personal opinion is that this way will be much more helpful to poorer nations than just sharing their profits."
10589,social revolution Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,"Online communication technologies have revolutionized how people interact with each other. I agree that these technologies have adverse impacts on interpersonal relationships. Ċ Social apps may make communication shallower and thus make relationships more cosmetic. First, people, particularly the youth, may trade off face-to-face communication for online messaging. In this way, they would miss important non-verbal information including facial expressions, tones, and body language. Relegating face-to-face talks to exchange of texts could result in a lack of deep understanding between people. Also, the ""like"" feature on social media cannot strengthen interpersonal ties. This is because ""likes"" do not carry any information further than general appreciation. On the contrary, spending too much time on liking posts could mean that no time is left for quality communications. Ċ An equally worrying effect of online communication is that it may spread jealousy and anxiety. Fascinating travel pictures, photos of perfect bodies, and impressive update on profiles are abundant on Facebook feeds. On seeing these posts from friends, one may feel jealous and anxious. Some may even feel like a failure in comparison to their friends. To avoid this sense of defeat, some may alienate themselves from their friends. As a result, online communication tools could make their users more isolated. Ċ To conclude, modern messaging tools could degrade interpersonal relationships, although they were designed to forge communication. Main impacts include shallower interactions and a sense of alienation."
10590,"We live in a world in which we are constantly exposed to advertising. To what extent does advertising influence our choices as consumers, and what effect does it have on our lifestyles? Ċ Discuss this issue and give your opinion.","Highlighting products an influential method to attract customers. A great deal of goods is displayed worldwide by several companies. I believe that it has vital impacts on our choices. Furthermore, it has both positive and negative influences on our daily lives. Ċ There is a host of point as to why our products-selection is dependent on various handbills, posters, TV advertisements. Firstly, we are always looking for the latest manufacturings. Therefore, whenever companies produce any goods, they demonstrate those things on satellite channels, newspapers for appealing purchasers. Furthermore, sometimes, they guarantee. As a result, we believe their commitments and buy them. For example, a survey was conducted in India about a couple of months ago concerning how people choose their shoppings. Those Indians replied that they always followed the instructions of advertisements and commitments. Ċ On the other hand, although advertisements play a significant role to determine our necessities, it brings some conveniences and disadvantageous effects on our lifestyles. The prime opportunity is that we can cope up with the fashionable and technology-based world. Because, producers inform us regarding the most widespread and popular products. However, the principal drawback can be that individuals have the probability to be deceived. Because, there are a number of industries who supply second-hand products wittingly for more profit. So, if people buy them because of mesmerizing, they will be definitely abortive to posses their expected products. For instance, statistics demonstrated that, in Bangladesh, a quarter of citizens are happy to buy products according to advertising, but ten in one inhabitant is regretful for not having original products. Ċ To conclude, if we select products with validation, we will hardly be cheated. The essay discussed the view and put forward evidences why buying products in terms of attraction by company's advertisements will be advantageous as well as inconvenient impacts on our citizens."
10591,"The major cities in the world are growing fast, as well as their problems. What are the problems that young people living in cities are facing with? Give solutions to these problems.","Majority of the cities have been developing rapidly. This growing, leads to the problem that made the young people struggle. Nevertheless, there are some possible solutions that could be taken into account to address this issue. Ċ High standard of living is a main problem of youngster living in the cities. All of the costs, such as foods and accommodations are higher than in the urban areas. This is due to the competition of business among city dwellers is firm. In addition, another major problem is the traffic jam. As the city is the most densely occupied area, many of them prefer using their own vehicle to using public transportation. Thus, it is undoubtedly that the bottleneck is the problem that make the youngster struggles. Ċ Turning to the possible solutions, the young people ought to live economically and manage their money efficiently. For instance, they not buy unnecessary items, more often eat at home rather than at restaurant, and so forth. Therefore, they are able to save deposit for a rainy day. Another possible solution is, they are supposed to use public transportation in their daily pursuits. If the distance of destination place is nearby, walking is the best way to decrease the number of transportation in the street. Hence, the problems of traffic jam could be diminished. Ċ In conclusion, living in the big cities leads to the troubles for the young people. However, the problems they facing are a challenge, in order to they become a good citizen who are able to adapt in every hard situation."
10592,People argue that raising children in today’s society is more difficult than in the past. Others believe that it is much easier due to all the innovations. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Whereas some argue that raising children in our modern society is harder than in old times, others claim that it is much simpler because of new inventions. In my opinion, while in the past children were not so exposed to strangers as today, raising a child nowadays is easier due to innovations in health system. Ċ First of all, innovations in health care have helped people to give proper medical assistance for their children. Thus, it is cheaper than ever to take care of an infant on his or her early stage of life. For example, not only vaccination costs dropped consistently due to recent innovations on medical methods, but also medical equipment has been modernized leading to cheaper exams. Consequently, child mortality has declined significantly over the past decades, especially in developing countries. Ċ On the other hand, new technologies have made easier for children to access the internet. Hence, increasing the danger of exposing them to strangers, since children are easily fooled by strangers, and parents are not always monitoring their conversations as they should. For instance, a stranger can either convince a youth on meeting him willing to do to do some harm or induce the youth to hurt someone else or itself. Therefore, restricting children's online communication can mitigate this risk but will not solve the problem completely. Ċ In conclusion, while improvements in the health care system have made the task of raising a child easier, internet access presents a risk at the moment children can get in contact with strangers. Then, in my opinion the innovations in medical area outweigh the risk of exposing the children on the internet."
10593,"Some people think that zoos are cruel and should be closed down; however, others believe that zoos can be useful in protecting wild animals. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is currently easy to find a zoo as there are many of them around the world. However, it is doubtable if they treat animals well or just want to make money out of it. As it is hard to be known, should a place be trusted to protect wildlife in danger or not? Let's analyse both points and I'll give my point of view to conclude it. Ċ On the one hand, it is possible to find sanctuaries which usually claim to have the duty of caring for injured pets and afterwards place them back to nature. Although, when some animal suffers an injury as being hit by a car for example, and not completely recover from this, it consequently cannot survive if left into the jungle. Moreover, take the risk of getting into another accident. Ċ On the other hand, there is a range of zoos with a business purpose only. Sadly, in this case, animals are just a kind of attraction. Allegations of mistreatment, lack of hygiene and bad living conditions are unfortunately common about these venues. They pretend to treat creatures fairly when public come to visit, but that might be totally the opposite while no one is seeing this. Ċ To sum up, briefly, the pros and cons are easily found in keeping those places opened. Even though knowing some of them just have the intention to help, there are still others taking advantage of it through bad treatment, and that is the reason why I truly believe the government should shut zoos down and take full responsibility of watching and caring for wildlife."
10594,"In the past, most people used to travel to their place of work. With increased use of computers, the internet and smart phones, more and more people are starting to work from home. Ċ What are the advantages and disadvantages of this development?","These days, the capabilities of the Internet have been changing and the vast majority of the population embarks to work from home. I tend to think that such a tendency has both positive and negative sides. Nevertheless, I believe that if household offices are employed for the right purposes, their benefits outweigh their drawbacks. I advocate strongly with my own views and am going to provide some arguments, which would be confirmed my position. Ċ On the one hand, we can observe some advantages of the online occupation. In my opinion, one of the main reasons why society wants to stay at home during the day consists of convenience. For instance, staffers can not waste their time when going to offices. In addition, employees, who perform their duties from home, can start their workday earlier in contrast to employees, who must be able to a workplace at a certain time. Ċ On the other hand, experts would argue that online work is composed of various flaws. For example, some people undergo difficulties in order to organise themselves. Besides, they can not concentrate on work entirely if others reside with them at home and often concern them throughout the day. In spite of these issues, the minority of people prefers to visit offices in lieu to stay at home for occupation. Also noteworthy is that online work is so common during the current outbreak. Ċ To summarise, I would stress that having made these points, it is true that household offices receive some criticism, and perhaps this is a delightful idea. What employers should do is composed of providing handy and comfortable conditions for the online and offline occupations respectively."
10595,Today's children are living under more pressure from the society than in the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.,"In this modern era, competition among children is getting tougher. So, the kids' life is not as enjoyable as in the past to satisfy their parents' desire. I really believe that they get more stress than children in the previous generation, and there is suggestion to make comfortable situation for them. Ċ This is no doubt that parents more enforce their children in order to reach the good future. They decide the children future based on their experience and society condition. Get a good score in school become a measurement, so student have to learn as much as possible every day. Besides academic achievement, join extracurricular and some courses is done by kids to improve soft skill also enrich the capability. These all parents do without asking their children, they don't know what the kids really want to do, it makes they can't enjoy their childhood. It was different with people in previous era which the competition is not as tight as now. Ċ Although parents pressure their children, it is all they do because they want the best of the kids. Parents think that study is much better than do online activities such as social media and games. They don't want to their child access the bad sites or becoming a game addict. So, parent trying to keep their kids away from danger possibility by extending their child's positive activity. It is also to prepare children for global competition in future. Ċ To sum up, although parents pressure their children for the child goodness, I totally agree that kids today's get more enforcement from their parents. Impose the parents desire is bad for children, so parent have to care about their children enthusiasm to maximize their ability which can support their future."
10596,people obsessed with looking young - why? Many people try to look younger than they really are. What are the reasons for that? Is it a positive or negative development?,"People, nowadays, have a strong inclination towards appearing young as compared to their real age. Factors such as social acceptance and attainment of good health can be attributed to this phenomenon. This essay intends to look at these two factors and following this look, an opinion will be discussed regarding its impact the society. Ċ To begin with, looking youthful has become a social norm in the society. This attitude has been deeply ingrained in people's minds as they are continuously bombarded with information by various marketing companies. For example, it is common to see the cosmetic advertisements of many good looking models on the television, which put great emphasis on looking young and beautiful and thus influence the minds of people. Therefore, people may want to appear young in order to meet the society's expectations and fear that they will be considered as outcasts if they donot follow such norms. Ċ Further, another reason why people want to look young is because they may want to keep themselves away from the serious health issues namely diabetes, obesity and to name but a few, that the old age brings with itself. As a result, they try to follow various fitness and health regimen to look young. Ċ Following this look at the causes, it is felt this perception of people has positive impacts on the society. An advantage worth mentioning is that people are encouraged to form good health and eating habits. In addition, appearing young can bolster the confidence among the people. Ċ In conclusion, it can be said that the social mindset and achievement of physical soundness are the reasons why people want to look younger than their real age. Also, it can be agreed that this attitude is advantageous in terms of the personal development it brings to people's l"
10597,People today move to new cities or new countries more than ever before. What challenges do they experience? What strategies are there to meet these challenges?,"Throughout the world an immense migration through cities raise a pace than decades ago. Obviously, some challenges are related to such phenomenon which will be faced immigrants as an exercise to treat their toughness. However, some strategies should be prepared in order to increase immigrant readiness before turn onto the real migration. Ċ Different living habit challenges a city migration. Also, modern cities are identically with individualism as their personal task fulfillment forces them to reduce socialization time. Engaging with such habit can be triggered a culture shock for city newbie. For instance, working habit in Japan takes high rate of individualism among inhabitants. In case, a new worker coming from highly socialized place which cannot express the togetherness feeling, loneliness will be very suffer. It is also important to talk about different taste of cuisine. While newcomer cannot adapt with serving cuisine, they might be got a health problem as insufficient nutrition intake. For instance, West Sumatra region identically cooked spicy taste. When Javanese people refuse to eat such identical taste, they might experience a gastric as their favourite is unavailable there. Ċ On the other hand, best preparation brings best adaptation. Therefore, observing the destination places entirely may be the best advice. For example, Getting LOA from University in Canada, My uncle collects all of living habit there in order to increase his readiness before class started. Also, try to simulate local habit is another best preparation. While Canadian University requires their student to make 5 essays a day, it is good to write with similar quantity as their struggle with happening challenge. Ċ Having said that, experiencing the challenges always engage in new immigrant. Even though sometimes it is hard to be an immigrant, the best preparation will be benefitted especially for immigrant's mentality. I believe that well prepared brings good live in a new place."
10598,"In countries like Japan, the population is getting older, are the effects of aging population on society is negative or positive. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is no doubt that aging population has becoming a global challenging issue that many countries in the world are facing right now. In general, with the help of modem science, people are now having a longer life expectancy. Even though longevity is a gift, it might come alone with potential risks and unexpected impact on the society. Ċ Admittedly, there are some issues that have already appeared in the society as a fact with the aging population. First of all, the government have to spare more financial budget for pension benefit each year as the amount of aged people are growing. Moreover, as a large portion of the population is facing deteriorating health, it will induce more medical expenses and social welfare. As a consequences, either the government would suffer a financial deficit or the burden will fall onto the younger generation as the states will need more tax revenue. Ċ However, the effect of an aging population might not be all negative. One of the most obvious benefit is that the older employees can be extremely productive and efficient and this can help the company to succeed. Another positive effect is that the rising demand for aged care industry will create millions of jobs and opportunities for young people and reduce the unemployment rate. Last but not least, it is common to see that a lot of grandparents help out with domestic duties including taking care of their grandchildren to spare up the parents to work. Ċ To sum up, it is probably better for a society to achieve age equilibrium in the population. However, if the population has already lost balance, we need to be ready for more actions and changes to adapt to the circumstances and create opportunities as to embrace longevity as a gift but not as a threat."
10599,it is common these days to see celebrities advertising different products. do the advantages of this development outweight the disadvantages. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant example from your own knowledge or experience.,"In this modern era, it is said that multifarious companies get the assistance of famous persons to advertise their products in the market. In this essay, I will explicate both merits and demerits with the relevant instance in the upcoming paragraphs. Ċ To commence with the benefits, promoting various kinds of commodities by celebrities has become popular in this generation and there are ample of positive sides of this trend. In other words, organizations aware that advertising any product requires trust and honesty so they opt for famous personality to give ads to their brands. For instance, time of India newspaper has conducted a survey that India's prestigious companies obtain help from popular Bollywood actors to advertise their upcoming brands. In addition, the new generation follows their lifestyle and purchase all the brand and things whatever they buy. As a result, the company's economy becomes strong due to products which are launched by celebrities. Ċ Despite these positive sides, there are few negative sides which can lead to personalities bad image as well as reduction of the business economy. To elaborate, some brands seem very effective during the promotion of them but when people start utilising it on the daily basis then they realise it was wastage of money and people do not trust on celebrities and do not spend their finance on new products. For example, India's prestigious company called 'dantmangan' launched toothpaste in 2011, and multifarious singers have given ads on this new paste without using it and received money from companies. Also, when people opted to use it was ineffective. As a result, company and advertisers got bad comments on their profiles and lead to a lack of money and reputation. Ċ To conclude, I think that there are many pros as compare to cons so, promoting a new product makes an organization and promoter financially strong but sometimes it is risky without using advertising material prior to showing it through the ads."
10600,"Some people think the government should stop putting money in art programs and put the money in more important fields such as sports facilities, medical care or national defense. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays people start concentrating on their own country's investments as they increasingly realize that it links to their future life. Consequently, the aim of such investments becomes a hot-debated topic of discussion when people try to find out the better places where the money goes, for example, art or infrastructure such as sports facilities, medical care or national defense. Ċ Obviously, all governments are supposed to meet their people's basic needs at first. Especially and certainly the highest priorities for developing countries are to resolve the poverty and guarantee the safety and health, which surely requires a huge amount of money to invest in. Compared with those developed countries, developing countries do not constantly have solid financial support, so they should target the comparably short-term achievement to improve people's daily life, most of which is spent pursing basic requirements rather than art programs. Without adequate food supply, healthy bodies and peaceful environment, individuals would not have any interests on painting, singing or dancing. Ċ However for other developed countries, they probably already do not need to worry about the materials to survive through hundreds of years' development. And even importantly, they have consistently healthy financial system so that they are able to grow the art programs and stimulate people's further needs on spirit. In other words, the developed countries may invest in the higher level of what people need with the stable base of materials. Ċ In developing countries, prioritizing infrastructure is not the same as that they are deprived of the opportunities of developing other things beneficial to the people, in fact, the governments should be fully responsible for the development targets on each stage that adapts to each country's real situation."
10601,Some people believe it's wrong to keep animal in zoos while other think that zoos are important for both its educational and ecological value. Discuss both views zoo still plays a crucial part in protecting endangered species,"In this modern world, there has been an ongoing debate on the controversial roles of the zoo. Some believe keeping animals in cage is morally wrong wwhile others emphasize on the preservation and education roles that rest upon the shoulder of the zoo. In this essay, I shall put forth my arguments to discuss both perspective to get the impartial view of the problem. Ċ There are several reasons to implicate that it's unethical to nurture wildlife animals in captivity. Confining animals in small spaces has been scientifically proven to assert some detrimental effects on their behaviors. Predators raised in the zoo lose their instinct to hunt while small creatures do not feel threatened by their hunters. The disappearance of these traits, which keep them alive in the wild, put their existence in peril. The dependant on human for food and care, in addition, worsen the above problem. Ċ The zoo offers some crucial benefits despite of the downsides. It is, first of all, a sanctuary for some endangered species, which should have perished if left alone in the wild. Take dodo birds for example, if it had not been for the relentless effort of the Australian Zoo, this distinctive bird could have been wiped out. Scientists at the zoo work their best to provide an environment that is predator-free and with stable temperature so that the bird and its offspring can thrive. Another factor to demonstrate the significant role of the zoo is its ample educational value for children of all ages. Zoo is the ideal place to instil the awareness to preserve the environment into young generation's mind. Ċ In conclusion, although facing with several criticisms for its moral issues, the zoo still play a crucial part in protecting endangered species and education young children."
10602,"Some people prefer to watch movies at the cinema, others like watching their movies at home, as home theaters become more popular. Discuss your opinion.","I agree with the statement that people are becoming more interested about home theater to watch movie rather than going to cinema hall. From the increasing popularity of home theater it seems that there might have some convenience in it. Ċ At present swift pace of life and hectic schedule pushes people to be busy at any time. As a result, it has been quiet difficult for men to go to cinema for enjoying a movie due to time limitation. In addition, we are bound to watch a movie in cinema that is being displayed at the moment whether we like its story, actor-actresses or not. Moreover, we may have to wait in a line to get ticket. Very often we may not get required number if we desire to get a large numbers of tickets. Sometimes, seat, allocated by hall authority may not satisfy us. Ċ Conversely, at the end of a stressful day, one can get pleasure from a nice movie sitting at home during leisure. At home we can enjoy movie casually, either sitting or lying or walking during doing something. For example, dinner can be prepared as well through watching a movie. Even he can review some more attractive portion of the movie, or can have a movie taking break if necessary. Occasionally, at family party, home theater offers us much entertainment. Ċ However, we can go to cinema with friends and family members during vacation. It's a kind of outing that energizes us. Ċ To recapitulate, I would appreciate home theater for the ease it offers us. Due to scientific breakthroughs, we are always shifting away in doing things from the way we did earlier. Home theater can be considered such a development that helps us to cope with modern way of life."
10603,TOPIC: Companies use different ways to increase sales. What different ways do companies use to increase sales? What is the most effective one?,"During these days, enterprises have high demand for raising brand awareness and this trend has led to a variety of advertising strategies. Some of the most common ways are via visual illustration and word of mouth but celebrity endorsement is considered to bring the best result. Ċ To commence, advertising through visuals is synonymous with approaching customers by providing them numerous images and related information about the brands. Examples include banners and leaflets which are continuously distributed in public places or even large screens hung on high- rise buildings around crowded streets. As a result, consumers are gradually instilled with the products, facilitating their desires to possess them. Ċ Moreover, the technique of spreading the brand's reputation through word of mouth is also favored by many companies. Nowadays, people religiously chat with their relatives such as families and friends so that should anyone recommend a product even if it is not necessary, it could still win trust from others. Ċ Even though there are several ways to improve profit, affiliation with celebrities, especially young influencers, is being chosen by the majority. Along with the advancement of social platforms, the youth is easily affected by their idols. To be more specific, teenagers seem to buy things that create moments with famous people or choose the products shared by them. For example, from luxurious brands such as Channel to lower ones, they all have celebrities become their ambassadors, promoting their sales to a larger scale of customers thanks to their huge fans. Ċ In conclusion, it is evident that there are a number of ways to increase sales and collaboration with famous influencers might be the most ultimate one."
10604,Young adults should contribute to their communities by doing unpaid work in their free time. Ċ Do advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"Adolescents can do a community service without getting a salary in their leisure time. The disadvantages of this notion outweigh the advantages because youngsters will not be able to earn for expenses, views related to this will be discussed in the subsequent paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, the main advantage of doing a public task during free period is that it causes a decline in educational performance of adolescents. To elaborate, youngsters will not be able to get sufficient rest after doing the work. This often contributes to lack of concentration on studies which leads to poor academic grades. For instance, young adults who mostly do public work for free rarely spend enough time on their education. Thus, adolescents' academic score might get adversely impacted by doing community work without any salary. Ċ In addition, financial problems usually arise when youngsters provide services to the society without any charges. To clarify, as young adults cannot earn hard cash, personal expenses such as clothes, education fees cannot be afforded. As a result, financial dependency on parents increases. Hence, adolescents will not be able to earn for themselves if job done in free hours without payment. Ċ On the contrary, community service without pay in free time leads to the holistic development of an individual. To substantiate, since youngsters often interact with enormous people, communication skills and cooperation quality will be improved. This leads to an interactive social life. To illustrate, youngsters often develop moral values while doing public services without any pay. Therefore, the personality of young adults builds up after doing free social tasks. Ċ In conclusion, social services without pay reduces education grades as well as putting financial burden on youngsters. However, ethics can be learned while doing neighbourhood tasks."
10605,Technology is very much a part of modern life. Many people see technology as a force that has escaped from human control. Others feel that technology has improved the quality of life. Do you think that the contribution technology has made to modern life has been positive or negative? State your position on this issue and support it with appropriate examples,"I believe that contribution the technologies made to modern life have been positive because they connect humans from around the world. Some believe that technologies have escaped humans' control as they damage the environment. On the other hand, technologies have created a better place for humans to live in. Ċ Thus, I believe that the technologies have been positive to modern life. They connect people from around the world using modern communication devices, such as internet, cell phone, and social media. These devices also allow people to talk face to face, although they are at different places. This is very helpful for those that live far away from their families. Ċ For example, I used to feel lonely and homesick because I was away from my families. Although my parents called me once a week by phone, I still felt sad because I was unable to see their faces. But now, the new modern communication devices, such as Skype, Lines and so on have allowed us to see each other through a video call. In other words, these new technologies have brought me closer to my family, even though we are physically away from each other. Ċ In conclusion, technologies are created to improve humans' life. Technologies help humans with their works, and they have been important keys in humans' civilization. That is why I believe that technologies have contributed positively to modern life because they are able to connect humans from around the world."
10606,"We cannot help everyone in the world that needs help, so we should only be concerned with our own communities and countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In some previous years, assisting each other is not an activity aiming for personal benefits only. Among people around the world, this trend is growing positively. Especially, the field of action is widened from community into worldwide range. Ċ When doing a charity, we should not distinguish between our nation and these others. The reasons for that are absolutely simple: we are of the same race even if we come from different nations and the important meaning of help lies in what you have given. Did you bring the poor what exactly they want? Did you really sympathize and feeling their hurts? And whether you do these work with your heart? Those are what you should concern about. Ċ Moreover, helping each other is the lofty and beautiful behavior that can improve the relationship among nations all over the world. For instance, in 1970, Vietnamese army helped Cambodian subvert Pon Pot government, which is return the peace life toward Cambodia. Vietnamese do that without weighing the pros and the cons. Above all, they understand deeply the meaning of solidarity and friendship that they received. In the modern world, if one nation just tends to develop itself but pays attention in these others, it will be isolated and lose the friendships. Ċ To summarize, helps should be done with our honest heart. We can start with assisting people around us and then broaden in some distance locations. Although, people have limited abilities, I ensure that with the enthusiasm and desire of helping each other there will not any barriers between us./."
10607,"Tobacco, mainly in the form of cigarettes, is one of the most widely used drugs in the world. over a billion adults legally smoke tobacco every day. The long term health costs are high- for smokers themselves, and for the wider community in terms of health care costs and lost productivity. Do governments have a legitimate role to legislate to protect citizens from the harmful effects of their own decisions to smoke, or are such decisions up to the individual?","It is debatable if government should create laws to prohibit smoking. On one hand where such laws can be beneficial for citizens but at same time they are invasion of individual rights too. This essay will firstly examine the benefits of making such laws followed by discussion of disadvantages before arriving at a reasoned conclusion. Ċ The are mainly two advantages of having a ban on tobacco and its products. One is that the government will not have to spend money on health care costs associated with diseases linked to excessive smoking. It is well established fact that smoking leads to a variety of diseases and makes people unfit. Other advantage is that healthy citizens are useful asset to a country as they can be productive and earn enough to support themselves, their families and others in need. Ċ Having considered the advantages, it is equally important to examine the disadvantages associated with having such laws. Firstly, such a law is invasion of individual rights. A democratic government gets elected to safeguard the rights of its people and such a law can prove very unpopular. Secondly, the governments usually earn a lot of money by taxing tobacco products heavily. By banning these altogether, government will lose a significant source of revenue. Ċ In my opinion, government can make policies to encourage people to give up smoking. For instance, there is a ban on smoking in public places in India. I disagree that a government should put a blanket ban on tobacco products as it will not be correct both economically and democratically."
10608,Some people think that the crime among teenagers is increasing because of violent video games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The effect of aggressive video games on youngsters has been a debatable issue. I think that video games play a significant role in diverting the mind of young ones towards anger and fights but it is not the only factor to be blamed. Ċ To begin with, it can be strongly argued that the growing minds are strongly influenced by what they see and do. Family issues can affect their brains to a large extent. For instance, if they see debates and arguments between their family member they will definitely grow up like them. Additionally, Action movies and Tv serials involve violent weapons and dangerous stunts. Teenagers try to perform these in real life which can lead to violence and accidence. Ċ On the other hand, video games involve winning by harming the other side. This builds a feeling of hate and dislikes for others. For example, Pub G had led to the death of many children as they tried to do the things they learnt from the game in real life. Further, the overuse of these computer games also decreases the social connection of kids and they face stress and depression as they stop sharing things with others. Ċ In the conclusion, I would say that PlayStations are responsible for bringing violence among youth to some extent. But there are other reasons like family issues and action movies which can be equally blamed. Young minds can be compared with mud pots which can be shaped as we want. Therefore, parents should take care of what their children see and do."
10609,TOPIC:-Some people argue that cars should be banned in city centres while others are against this idea. Discuss both the sides and give your opinion . no access for cars to the downtowns,"Nowadays, cars have become an efficient means of transportation. The invention of cars has provided comfort and reduced travel time, but at the same time has caused serious environmental threats, like noise and air pollution. Some people are in favour of banning the cars in city centres to solve these issues. However, there are a few who share a different perspective. Ċ The growing popularity of the cars has caused serious traffic problems and environmental issues. Some people think that abandoning this four-wheeled vehicle will reduce congestion. This would further reduce the stress level of the people caused due to the daily traffic jams. Furthermore, this will be a significant step to tackle environmental threats by reducing air and noise pollution. As these cars run on fuel, like petrol, diesel etc. The harmful gases are released due to the constant burning of these fuels, resulting in the rise in air pollution and several hazardous diseases amongst individuals. Henceforth, forbidding the motorcars would lead to a healthy environment and preservation of the non-renewable fossil fuels. Ċ However, there is a flip side to it. Restricting the four-wheeled vehicle would negatively impact the overall economy of the country. Automobile industries significantly contribute to the growth and development of the country by providing a wide variety of employment opportunities. Casting out these vehicles will drop the production and hence resulting in the shutdown of several car manufacturing firms. This would further lead to unemployment and other redundancies. Ċ In my opinion, banning the cars is not a wise resolution to tackle the environmental issues. However, the government should encourage the people to restrict the use of it by providing an efficient and economical means of public transportation. They should roll out awareness programs to encourage the individuals to car-pool and explore other means of transportation."
10610,"Eventually, technology will solve the most important environmental problems the world faces today. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Our dependence on technology on a day to day basis cannot be understated. Some people believe that the latest advancements in tech are pivotal in answering environmental concerns. In this essay, I will go over why I partially disagree with this narrative and why I believe that technology is causing more problems than it is solving. Ċ To begin, the introduction of the latest technology like hybrid vehicles and special vehicles to clean the water bodies has seemingly taken over and become an answer to the ecological crisis. For instance, the special battery used in hybrid vehicles is widely known to reduce carbon monoxide emissions caused by vehicles. Therefore, there is a good reason to believe that the more of these vehicles we have, the lesser the damage to our echo system. Ċ Furthermore, the introduction of electronic fuel cells was seen as a major step in the right direction to curb air and noise pollution because these special electronic engines do not need gasoline. However, the production of these electronic fuel cells is known to cause more damage to the environment compared to the average lifetime of a vehicle that runs on gas/diesel. This means that the more of these fuel cells we create, the more we damage the environment. Ċ Finally, I disagree with the notion that tech has become an answer in answering the environmental crisis. The focus should be on finding alternate sources of energy to sustain the demand and find ways to make electric fuel cells that are not harmful to the echo system."
10611,"Sports which depend on violence for their entertainment, such as boxing and wrestling, have no place in a civilized society and should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","With the pressures and bustles in modern life, sport is considered as one of the best form of entertainments. In recent years, the popularity of sports containing violent factors has led to the heated controversy over the question whether they should be banned or not. Many people hold a strong view suggesting that combat sports cannot be existed in a civilized society. However, from my point of view, it should be made illegal due to the reasons presented in this essay. Ċ To begin with, in a well-organized and developed society, people have the rights to decide which sports are suitable to practice and entertain. In other words, the prohibition can be used to illustrate for fossilizing human civilization to the past and restricting the development of human's rights. Furthermore, if boxing and wrestling are not allowed to play, law systems generate the unfairness between them with other sports which also cause some serious injuries or even death such as extreme sports and contact sports. Ċ Similarly, combat sports benefit society in many ways. In specific, it is a suitable method for improving health's communities when people do exercise reasonably. Moreover, people can use it to defend themselves in may dangerous situations. Whilst women, for example, use it to against criminal rapes, men can protect themselves in a society where violence is increasing considerably. Last but not least, by imposing taxes on sport entertainment industry, government can get money for social budget, using for charity and succour purposes, or improving the living condition of residents. Ċ All in all, the is no denying that fighting sports have advantages for both individuals and socities. Therefore, I would like to emphasize and reiterate that instead of banning them, we should permit them in controllable scales."
10612,Solving environmental problems should be the responsibility of an international organization rather than each national government. Do you agree or disagree?,"In recent decades, environmental problems, such as global warming and natural resource depletion, have been receiving a great deal of media attention due to their substantial impacts on human life. As a result, many environmentalists believe that multinational organizations are better than national governments in addressing these problems. I completely agree with this point of view. Ċ On the one hand, many local governments have no interest in solving the problems for a variety of reasons. First, it is true that most of these governments do not realize the necessity of environment protection. Therefore, if the responsibilities are handed over to them, they will end up doing nothing, which is detrimental to both the local and global environment. Second, since the costs, either financial or non-financial, of dealing with environmental problems is extremely high, most countries are not willing to trade their resources for small returns. For example, many nations, especially developing ones, do not invest money in reducing carbon footprint even though they are affected by climate change. Ċ On the other hand, it is more reasonable that global institutions should in charge of global issues like environmental ones. First of all, by enacting international laws, these institutions ensure that each national governments have to take actions to protect the environment. For example, if there are strict global laws on carbon emissions, the number of countries contribute to global warming will decrease significantly. As well as this, many places on Earth, such as the North Pole and the South Pole, are affected by global warming but do not entirely belong to a single nation. Therefore, if there are no multinational organizations take responsibility for this problem, these places will be damaged significantly. Ċ In conclusion, global institutions should hold accountable for environmental problems instead of local governments. However, each country should support these institutions to combat the issues."
10613,"Some people think that children should be raised by all the family members (eg: uncle, aunt and grandparents) rather than only parents. Give your opinion.","Raising children has become an important aspect of anyone's life. There are sections of society who believes that the kids need to be brought up by all family members and not just their parents. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of it and the limitations of raising the young minds by the parents alone. Ċ In fact, there are a few disadvantages of raising kids by only their mother and father. Firstly, the kids only get to learn from their parents, which limits the amount of their social interactions. For example, it is widely known that the kids with greater social interactions in their childhood grow up to become individuals with high social skills and good communication. Secondly, they would rely upon formal training to develop their skills rather than seeking advice from their immediate family. Ċ On the other hand, there are huge benefits that can be derived when kids are raised by all the family members. Not only does it increase their social interactions in their earlier ages, but also enables them to become well rounded people. Additionally, it helps the family members in overcoming financial woes, which enables the kids to grow up with all the required resources. For instance, it is an accepted matter that in large joint families, members are able to effectively overcome monetary issues with the help of their relatives, thus bringing about a better quality of life for themselves and their children. Ċ To conclude, when kids are brought up by all the family members together, they tend to learn a lot more than being raised just by their parents and hence more beneficial. However, with the advent of corporate culture and modernisation, families are shrinking and people are increasingly depending upon training programs for learning to raise their kids better, rather than depending upon their own parents."
10614,9.Large companies use sports events to promote their products. Some people think this has a negative impact on sports. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It has been pointed out that promoting their items in several game events has been carried out by large organizations, and some individuals opine that this trend is detrimental to athletics. Personally, I completely disagree with this idea as advertising products through campaigns is beneficial to the development of sports and the quality of matches. Ċ First of all, the top level of companies promote their goods via several well-known pastimes matches benefits the advancement of pastime itself. The reason is that a huge number of people who are massive fans of products can be attracted to watch the sports tournaments that are supported by famous brands, which increases the popularity of tournaments. For instance, during the Australia Open period, Country road as a sponsor is permitted to establish stores at the entrance of stadiums. A vast majority of fans of Country road who would like to purchase limited clothes need to buy a ticket to enter the Melbourne arena, which contributes to the promotion of tennis. Ċ Furthermore, inviting large companies to advertise goods on campaigns can bring economic benefits to tournament committees. This is because if companies are allowed to put their commercials in the middle of matches, they need to give a huge amount of money to athletics organizations. As a result, committees are less likely to worry about their funding and have sufficient funds to arrange matches, which increases the quality of competition. As an illustration, the members of the committee of the NBA say that as most of our sponsors need to spend 10 million every year promoting their products in basketball games, we are able to pay ample attention to other areas such as maintaining facilities of courts, leading to providing more exciting matches to audiences. Ċ In conclusion, although people may vary in their opinion about whether being allowed to promote goods in sports matches has advantages or not, I am opinion that this situation results in more benefits in terms of the development of athletics and the quality of competitions."
10615,"Now that computers can very well translate all kinds of languages in the world, do we really need to learn more languages in future? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is a universal fact that 21st century is the era of machines. From calculating, recording, online shopping, browsing to even translation of different kinds of languages in the world, there is nothing which a computer cannot do. One wonders, do we really need to learn languages in future. One needs to analyse both sides to come to a conclusion. Ċ Computers, complex yet highly useful can do anything, in which humans consume a lot of time.They can do it within seconds. Moreover, they can convert spoken language of one region to another. Which has made our work simpler and does not require us to put effort in actually studying and understanding the scripts of different parts. Especially, the ones who have related jobs, but do not have the space to study it. For example, many of the travellers do not have the interest in learning it, but just convert the dialogue whenever they want to. Ċ However, Human, being a social animal has taught himself to speak and converse in various ways with time. Language is the form of human behaviour which not only leads to the sharpness of the brain, but also helps in spreading knowledge by mastering the linguistic skills. Additionally, helping in understanding the origin and culture of that particular nation. For instance, history students take a deep interest in grasping the nuances of the various regions by first learning their language to understand about culture. Ċ If one relies too much on devices like computers for every art related work. It will lead to losing personal values of society in future. Ċ In conclusion, I would say, no matter how advance the world becomes, it cannot replace the human touch. Therefore, it is vital to learn languages of different countries which will keep our old civilisation alive."
10616,"Many claim that the fast food industry had negative effects on the environment, eating habits and families. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The prevalence of fast food is widely deemed to be detrimental to Mother Nature as well as key aspects of a healthy life, including diets and domestic relationships. Personally, I am an ardent advocate of the mentioned viewpoint. Ċ That convenience food adversely affects what one eats is readily apparent. A rise in red meat, salt and calories intakes is witnessed for virtually all people embarking upon the consumption of fast food on a regular basis, compared to their previous self-cooked meals with fresh ingredients bought from the market which might be more of an organic nature. In other words, owing to fast food being easily accessible to them, these individuals switch from a more or less healthier home-made diet to quick meals want of nutritions and high in substances that give rise to severe health issues such as hypertension, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Ċ Opponents of fast food also point to the fact that the constant use of it contributes to family aloofness, with which I consent. Ready meals of this kind deprive husbands and wives, as well as parents and children, of the opportunity to prepare and have dinner together after working separately for a whole day. This absence of family activities could, over a long period of time, induces a frosty atmosphere and a lack of mutual understanding among family members. Ċ In addition, there are environmental concerns raised with regards to the increasingly expanding junk food industry. Hamburgers, one of the most celebrated types of fast food, have beef as their core component. The significant demand for such ingredient encourages the farming of beef cattle, whose excrement releases methane, which is an even more potent candidate than carbon dioxide as a culprit behind global warming. Ċ To conclude, I am convinced that the expense of fast food brands thriving is the public's dietary plans and domestic happiness, as well as the environment, Earth's atmosphere in particular, are all negatively impacted."
10617,Stores should sell local food products and not imported food products. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is thought by Some people that stores should stock with local food items, while others are of the view that they should keep meal products from other countries too. In my opinion, it totally depends on the customer choice but stores should be ready to serve the need of the customer. Ċ There is no doubt that grocery stores will take care of the needs of the local people by providing them with fresh meal at a reasonable price. Moreover, the local meal stuff is healthy. In other words, people are easily aware of the brands within the nation. Apart from this, shops are at low risk as the local brand items will have more selling and would be easily available, if the store is left short in number for any specific stuff. Ċ Although there is no compulsion for stores to keep the imported foodstuff products, they are equally important for the business as well as for the public. For example, people who have migrated they are always searching for products and brands from their native place. Imported food is of such a good quality as they go under the government and helps in building business profit too. In addition, the products from another country will, also increase the economic factors and many crops are hard to grow within the country, so in order to meet the demands of the public it is necessary for shopkeepers to buy foreign items. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that imported foodstuff is as important as local foodstuff products because people do not miss those products found in their native country. The imported also help in building healthy relationship."

10619,"In many countries, people like to eat a wider range of food than can be grown in their local place. Therefore, much of the food people eat today has to come from other regions. Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh disadvantages.","These days, globalization is occurring everywhere in the world. Therefore, local residents have a chance to enjoy the international speciality of cuisine. Gradually, they prefer eating imported feed to consuming local cuisine. As far as I am concerned, the trend brings more backwards than benefits. Ċ On the one hand, imported goods can meet various needs of local people and encourage the national economy to develop. Firstly, consumers would have more choices to meet their demands. This is because the market is so busy, consumers not only find the local food, but also international cuisine in the retail. For example, America cannot plant tropical fruits, the American people can have an opportunity to taste new foodstuff by importing. Secondly, the producers have to be more creative to improve their products which are able to compete with imported goods. If local foodstuff can satisfy the needs of consumers, they will not use international food. Ċ On the other hand, the development also brings challenges to the local economy. This is because the weather only allows farmers to grow some certain plants. If they cultivated other plants, they could not have the expected harvest to serve the market. For instance, Ben Tre province is the most suitable place for growing coconuts, or Daklak province is the best place for cafe seeds grown. Moreover, as long as more residents like to buy international goods, local products will gradually disappear from the market. In other words, the farmers would change their career path to work in factories as blue-collar workers which they can earn more money. Ċ To conclude, consuming more imported foodstuff bring both advantages and disadvantages to consumers and the state economy. In my opinion, its backward needs to be considered more seriously.."
10620,Some people think that keeping pets is good for children while others think it is dangerous and unhealthy . which opinion do you agree with? discuss both view give examples,"It is true that a host of people nowadays especially kids tend to own a companion as a friend or because of their love for them. While some individuals believe that this trend has a positive effect on a child’s behaviour, others argue that playing with a pet is not safe and may bring some unexpected threat for the owners. I am personally of the opinion of the former. This essay will prove some logical reasons as to why the benefits of owning an animal can outweigh its drawbacks. Ċ On the one hand, having a pet comes up with various advantages for children. For instance, taking care of their furry friends such as taking them for a walk, grooming them, and feeding them teaches them to be more responsible not only with animals but also with every acquaintance. Furthermore, teenagers can consider their pets as their comrades when they have any disorder emotions due to their vulnerability at their age. Additionally, some researches indicate that youngsters at a very young age exposed to and who grew up with dogs and cats tend to have a better immune system compared to those who do not. Ċ On the other hand, parents have reasonable consideration to allow their offspring to nourish a household animal. One of their concerns is their aggressive behaviour which is dangerous for babies or youth who do not have a full cognition about animals. For example, those furry members can be triggered and attack their kids if they unconsciously bite or chew their bodies. Besides, household pets may spread disease and allergies to minors because they are normally a source of bacteria, pathogens, and viruses which are risky for children’s vulnerable physical health. Therefore, it is not secure if adults let pet with their sons and daughters and their furry companions are not cleaned and groomed every day. Ċ To sum up, whilst owning an animal may cause some negative consequences, I believe this does better than harm for juveniles because they can learn many things from having them as well as they will have better health from an early age. Consequently, it is advisable to let children contact with pets."
10621,"Some people believe that environmental problems are too big for individuals to deal with, while others think that that individuals should take some action. Discuss both views and give your opinion. BECAUSE ACTION SPEAKS LOUDER","Currently, there are some issues toward the environment should be noticed by the individual, because several problems of the environmental impacts have rapidly appeared in the society. As a contributor of the impacts, each individual should take some actions to reduce the environmental problems. It would not become too big for individuals instead of doing nothing for their own environment. Ċ First and foremost, there are some environmental problems which have to be faced out by the community today, such as flood which occurs every year and pollution particularly in the big cities. These problems would rise significantly time by time if there is no one has initiatives. The most important thing is individuals should take some actions together to solve the environmental problem. Each individual should contribute in many ways, for instance in health aspect, individuals who have been practitioners in health service have a responsibility to communicate and persuade the community to prevent their area from waste in order to avoid the flood. Ċ In addition, environmental problems would be easier to solve if the government support the society as well. Individuals can be more enthusiasts to face the problems. It would be a good way to educate youth generation because they become pioneers for change of the environment. Ċ In conclusion, it is clear that the best solution for solving the environmental problems that individuals should take some actions continuously. It would never become too big for individuals to get and live in a better environment, because action speaks louder than anything."
10622,"Most countries have traditional celebrations that occur annually. In your opinion, what benefits do these celebrations have for societies?","Tradition is a belief, behavior, and custom inherited from the past, which either has symbolic meanings or significant importance to society. Therefore, a great deal of traditional events is celebrated annually around the globe. However, the more modern our world becomes, the more these special festivals degenerated. This problem can obliterate the many benefits traditional celebrations have brought about to one's society. Ċ Celebrations of culture provide individuals a sense of identity. They not only answer the question of citizens' origins but they also remind citizens of what or who have shaped their lives. The people in my country, Vietnam, for instance, take great importance in celebrating the Hung King Temple festival. In this special event, everyone will commemorate Hung Kings-the founder of the Vietnam nation and after that, getting involved in a diversity of folk games such as bamboo swing, rice cooking competitions, or lion dance. Vietnamese people are reminded that owing to Hung Kings' efforts and labors, they are able to lead a well-of life in this day and age. Ċ Another sizeable value of cultural celebrations is that they educate us on things like freedom and benevolence, and help us pass on our cultural or religious history. In this aspect, Vietnamese people have Giong Festival, which is to commemorate Saint Giong, one of the four Vietnamese immortals. This event helps us remember the heroin battle of Saint Giong and his people, Van Lang, against foreign enemies in order to protect Vietnamese's freedom and rights. Ċ To summarize, no matter how diverse traditional celebrations are, they all serve the same purpose: being the underpinning of one's society. Thus, disregarding them can bring about severe problems and disadvantages."
10623,"Some people spend their entire lives in one place. Others move a number of times throughout their lives, looking for a better job, house, community, or even climate. Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place? Use reasons and specific examples to support you opinion.","The thriving development of technology has brought along all kinds of transportation medium that allows human to travel a long distance in just a blink of an eye. However, some people just like to stay in one place, while some like to move from places to places, looking for a more conducive environment and community. Personally, I prefer moving in search of a better place. Ċ Life, as we see it, could be compared to a storybook. Without a climax in the story, there is no way that the storybook can be a good one. Similarly, people should live their lives to the fullest by constantly pursuing the things they want.For instance, a better job, house, community and even climates. Life will be meaningless if we just stay in one place, watching the sun rises and sets everyday without a single minor changes in everything around you. Ċ Besides, the technology nowadays has brought us all kinds of transportation whether through air, sea or land. Consequently, it will not be a burden to travel from places to places as the contemporary transportation system has constrained the, huge wide world before, into a much smaller one, where people can just travel around the world in, approximately, 80days. Ċ People should learn to live their live, exploring and experiencing different kind of circumstances. To sum up, I prefer moving from continents to continents in search of another place because there's still a whole new world waiting for me to be explored."
10624,Many management interviews are based around assessing not only a person’s level of experience and knowledge but also their personality. Is leadership an innate skill? What other characteristics do companies look for in a manager?,"A good leader must possess multiple qualities. For this reason, most of the companies need managers with qualities such as good personality, knowledge and experience in their work. Leadership is an acquired skill and heredity can help a person acquire this skill. Ċ Firstly, leadership is one of the most important qualities for any managerial role. People who believe it is an innate skill, give reasons that a person needs to be optimistic and jovial and both these qualities are inherited. However, a person can be a good leader only if one is trusted and respected by team members. It takes effort from the manager, to gain the trust and respect. Hence, it is not just an innate quality, but an acquired one as well. For instance, most of the people feel comfortable in working with a chief who is trustworthy and optimistic. Ċ There are quite a few other qualities that companies look for in anyone with managerial role. Managers must have good communication skills because they need to communicate with the clients and the team members. It is a must to establish a good rapport on both parties to run a project smoothly. For instance, if someone has good relations with a client, then he/she will be able to convince them with the soft skills about the minor delay in the delivery of the project. They need to be as transparent as possible, so that they can set a good example for their teammates in terms of professionalism, dedication etc. They must possess good time management skills. This factor ensures the client of the timely deliveries without putting pressure on the in house teammates. Ċ To conclude, leadership is both innate and acquired in nature. Other than knowledge, personality etc., companies believe, managers must have qualities of soft skills, time management, transparency, optimism etc."
10625,"Parents should take course in parenting, in order to improve the lives of their children. To what extend do you agree?","Parenthood is the most important role of mankind. While some may argue that parents should take training exercises, others may disagree. In my opinion, though I believe that basic training is essential, I do not agree that everything can be taught by such courses. Thus, this essay will discuss both the positive and negative parts of parental training programs. Ċ To begin with, being a parent is not an easy mission. Regardless of previous experiences in being a father or mother, there will still be heaps of dilemmas. To help tackle some of these issues, these courses might come in handy. For example, in the case of new parents. these programs help them to gain an understanding of what all vaccines a newborn child needs to take and when exactly to get them. Therefore, it can be said that parenting lessons can assist the guardians in protecting their infants from ailments and health issues that are easily preventable. Ċ On the other hand, being a parent is a natural phenomenon and thus, the skills needed to be one will come with hands-on experience. Furthermore, every child has their own unique character and behaviour. Hence, classes that give generalized coaching on how to raise them might not prove effective. For instance, a silent introverted kid needs special care and attention compared to an active extroverted one. With the above-expressed view, it is quite clear that, unless individually focused classes are given, the parenthood training might end up being inefficient. Ċ In conclusion, considering the above-mentioned points, I strongly hold my opinion that parenthood coaching though useful to a certain extent is not one hundred per cent efficient in giving proper guidance to raising young ones."
10626,Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"The main purpose of educational system is to educate students in order to enable them to obtain professional skills. Consequently, common wisdom says that a college student should attend classes, which function as specific passages between professors and students. This is because teaching in classes is how most professors deliver and spread their knowledge and ideas to students. However, some people do not believe that it is necessary for students to attend every class. As I see, absenteeism is inappropriate for students most of the time unless under certain unusual circumstances. Ċ College professors are the experts, who are far more experienced and proficient in the academic fields compared to students. Thus, attending classes is the most effective and efficient way for students to learn. In other words, nonappearance to classes usually hinders students from learning. Clearly, most professors reveal or demonstrate their expertise in the classroom rather than other places. Students who do not come to classes will lose their opportunities to interact with professors. Of course it is possible that a student figure out some knowledge without others' assistance, but this process must be more arduous than learning directly from specialists, who already know the critical concepts and crucial theories in this subject. Ċ Nonetheless, for some special situations, I believe students can be absent from classes only if they can guarantee that they can maintain their progress. For instance, if there is an emergency, or a speech addressed by a renowned scholar, students can decide whether they want to go to class. However, when they make their own choice, they have to understand it is their responsibility to put more efforts in their homework and academic performance. Ċ In a nutshell, I argue that attending classes is of paramount importance for students' education. Even though sometimes, for certain reasons, absenteeism is unavoidable, students should not eschew their learning progress."
10627,"Some people believe that the internet has brought people closer together by making the world smaller. Others disagree, claiming that the internet has made people and communities more isolated because they no longer need to leave home and interact with others. Discuss both views. (No opinion)","The invention of the internet has definitely changed our world. Some people believe that it has changed for the better, bringing humans closer together, whereas others think that the situation has only worsened since nobody really interacts with others anymore. Ċ Firstly, part of our society thinks that the internet has multiple benefits. The web has indeed brought humans closer together since it allows you to contact anyone instantly, even if they live on the other side of the world. Moreover, there are multiple social media where you can post photos, share memories and interact with your friends and family. For instance, if some of your relatives don't live close to you, social media like Twitter and Instagram represent a great idea to keep in touch with them and keep them informed on how you are doing and what you are up to. Ċ On the other hand, the web has surely lead us to become antisocial. Having the opportunity to contact everyone through texts means that we have become lazier and we don't like to meet new people or even old pals and interact with them face to face. Furthermore, the extensive use of smartphones and other technologies has made us suffer from mental health problems like anxiety, so chatting with other members of our society in person feels more like a chore than a pleasure. For example, this has worsened with the pandemic and right now several youngsters feel pressured to go back to how things were before because they're too used to speaking to their peers through a screen. Ċ In conclusion, there are contrasting opinions regarding new technologies. While it's evident that the internet has helped us communicate better, in my opinion, it's undeniable that it also has led to several problems and difficulties."
10628,"Computers are an essential feature of modern education. Some people believe that certain subjects, such as mathematics, are better taught using computers. Others, however, think that there are aspects of education in which computer use is adequate. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","Nowadays, the use of technology has become a vital part of our lives. some people believe that we can make usage of computers in schools to provide children with better comprehension, innovative style, and consistently available resource to students. Others claim that there is no substitute for human souls. Therefore, Classes led by men are more interactive, so kids can learn better and faster. In this essay, I will share both perspectives and highlight why the blended approach is the best for our children. Ċ There is ample evidence to suggest that a smart technological way of teaching is beneficial. It can help students to have the material 24/7. Moreover, A child can make the value of automation in studying through games and simulated techniques rather than the traditional way of education. Thus, they will be more engaged and productive while studying their lessons. A recent study by Harvard University confirmed that using novel ways of learning can help the learners to be more focused and absorbed so they will retain information better. That's why scholars suggest the use of machinery in our educational system. For instance, Schools can rely on automation in checking answers. Furthermore, online learning can be a good solution in certain times like pandemics. Ċ On the other hand, some researchers believe that education is more than a transfer of information that can be done through technology. However, it's a complex of human interactions that must be led by a real teacher. Since immemorial time, tuition has been done through mentors and scholars. So, the next generation needs such real communication rather than the virtual one. For example, How a student can learn properly if he doesn't have a true role model in the class? Ċ To conclude, it's undeniable that technology has become an essential part of our lifetime. some people welcome it in the schoolwork while others believe in the human-human connection. I feel that the mixed strategy between humans and robotics is what we truly need. Using computers will help kids to evoke imagination while tutors can handle emotions and behaviours in the school."
10629,"In many countries, the rich are becoming richer and poor are becoming poorer. Why is this a problem? What solutions are there to tackle this problem?","Undoubtedly, it goes without saying the lavish people are living a luxurious lifestyle while the destitute people are being suffered from poverty. This disquisition delves into the details of why this kind of development is not welcoming and subsequently will advance some panacea to halting this menace. Ċ To begin with, one of the main issues of in several nations economy is controlled by large corporate houses hence, they only distribute all amenities and welfare to opulent society instead of destitute community consequently, still now this problem is increasing. Another problem is the lack of employment opportunity among impoverished people because wealthy folk can get any job easily than an indigent person due to the opulent have a quality education. For example, according to the survey said that more than 75% of folks are being suffered from poverty in the world. Hence, this trend should be decreased in the future days. Ċ Conversely, could there be any wonder drugs to solve this peril? Certainly, it follows that the authority should take the strictest measures by enforcing laws and punishments to strike a balance between the poor and rich standard. Another possible solution is the authority should be focused on the poverty-stricken person because they are also part of the nation hence, the government should provide all the amenities such as quality education, modern hospital and a plethora of employment job opportunity. For example, the government of Pakistan has been introducing enormous new plans to dwindling down the underprivileged folk's standard of living. Hence, the ministry should be arranged many facilities for the poor. Ċ To conclude, having explored both standpoints, this predicament should be diminished to using the possible solution. Nonetheless, executives should insist on unbreakable rules to dwindle down the discrepancy between poor and rich."
10630,"It is a common aspiration among many young people to run their own business, rather than work for an employer. Do you think the advantages of working for yourself outweigh the drawbacks?","Nowadays many young people seem to have aspiration after running their own business instead of working for a company. This essay strongly believes the advantages of working for yourself can't not outweigh its drawbacks because if they don't have enough experience, they won't be able to conflict with risks and challenges. Ċ One of the prime evidences supporting my idea is the lack of experiences of youngsters. Clearly, being an entrepreneur requires a lot of tactics and personal skill to either confront problems or develop their company and obviously, those, who haven't worked anywhere, don't have this ability. For instance, working for a period of time for a company firstly will help pupils not only learn managing skills from their bosses, get used to the pressures but also comprehend multiple knowledges in a specific domain. Therefore, there will be fewer risks and un-wanted circumstances when they decide to be self-employment. Ċ Although, running an entrepreneur gives them the opportunities to do whatever they want and also create a sense of autonomy rather than following rules, this may cause severe damages. Solemnly, they may be involved in to rivalry with other associations with no capability to compete against due to not having enough competence for facing burden and a wide vision. For example, in Vietnam, there are a vast number of people who want to be affluence by opening coffee shops, restaurants or buying stocks, but apparently, majorities of them have gone down the drain or even failed at the last hurdle just because they can't excel their opponents. Ċ To conclude, running a private company brings lots of dangers and uncertain potentialities. In spite of giving you independence and large amount of income, it could make you be insolvent and indigent. Ergo, it is encouraged for youngsters to contemplate gravely before venturing on staring up."
10631,Some people suggest that children do not understand the world of work and schools should make teenagers spend a short time working as well as studying academic subject. To what extent do you agree ?,"Professions plays an essential role in a mature person's life. However, a lot of youngsters are not able to understand the world of work after graduate, according to some people. Personally, I completely agree with this viewpoint and to my way of thinking, schools should offer teenagers to spend a certain amount of time to work along with studying academic subject. Ċ For a variety of reasons, I firmly believe that it is crucial for students to gain insight into the world of work during schoolyears. Firstly, when students know about how money is earned through hard work, they will be more grateful for what they have at the time. Some children, due to the pampering of their parents, do not understand the value of money and they just expect their parents to provide them with luxurious items. So to my mind, if those children have opportunities to work for a short amount of time, they will understand profoundly the value of money and know how hard their parents have to work and become more appreciative. Ċ Secondly, as being an adult, I aware of the difference between going to work and going to school, and in my opinion, the world of work is a cruel world where people have to be responsible for their work, where mistakes costs fortune, ...Therefore, I think teenagers should be provide with the chance of working as well as studying in order to not get shock in the future when they join the working world. Ċ In conclusion, according to the given reasons, I firmly agree that students should be facilitate to work during schoolyears and that would be a precious experience. However, students should balance between working and studying as spending too much time working can affect adversely on their academic performance."
10632,The only way to improve safety on the road is to punish drivers more harshly if they break the traffic law. Do you agree or disagree?,"Traffic safety problems have long been the headlines in agendas for most governments around the world. Some people argue that in order to make road travel safer, stricter punishment should be stipulates for transgressors by the governments. I agree with the view that punishment can succeed in curbing road offences but it should not be taken as the only solution. Ċ Admittedly, a harsh punishment is vital considering its deterrent effect on those who are likely to disobey road regulations. For example, Australia is one of the countries with the safest traffic all over the world. In there, traffic violators are fined more seriously than some other countries, such as people will be detained if they found to have drunk driving and a severe fine will be applied for over speeding rather than just verbal warning in some other places. Therefore, drivers and pedestrians become more aware of traffic law and comply with it better since they know the serious consequence after taking risk. Ċ However, despite the importance of imposing harsh regulations, the authorities should not overlook other options that may sometimes achieve better outcomes. For instance, rising the legal driving age could contribute to the improvement of road safety. Young people are legal to drive motor vehicles after 16 or 17 in some countries, such as Philippines and United Kingdom. However, teenagers are usually more impetuous but less mature than adults that are more likely to disobey the traffic regulations. As a result, postponing the legal driving age, for example to 21.5, in countries with high traffic accident rates could enhance young people's awareness of traffic law since they have more time for receiving education before driving legally. Ċ In conclusion, the apparent effectiveness of the harsher punishment measures on traffic law offenders should be acknowledged. However this is not the only way that achieves better and safer usage of roads. An integrated approach should be adopted such as rising the legal driving age."
10633,"In some countries, young people are less polite and respectful to the old. What are the causes? What can be done to solve this?","Nowadays, it is expressed that in many countries the respect for older does not exist. In this modern life, the youngest are less educated and polite some of them do not have any respectable behave in the old. For this purpose thus essay will be demonstrating the reasons why this is happening. The solution to solve this problem is parents educating their children, teaching them to respect the oldest and young with limits and discipline. Ċ Firstly, teenagers shown patterns of education received into their houses. For example, if the parents educated their children and taught the importance to respect older people, when teenagers, they will do this because they learned this. So the disrespectful and impolite behave of the younger is a result of the education they received in their homes. Ċ Secondly, the actual younger do not have any limits. They think that everything is allowed and everything can be bought. This is a consequence of the education they received in their lives. For instance, if the parents do not teach their children correctly in the future they can not complain about it, because their prospective children are a consequence of their today decisions. Ċ In summary, the responsibility for teaching the children and younger are the adults and parents. Further, if the adults are not available and wish to teach the behave is expected to the younger and children, they cannot complain about in the eventual. Hence today's children are tomorrow adults. An advice is the parents teaching, raising, and educating their children like they want that be treated in a prospective, like to do to other want you to want the other to do for you."
10634,Nowadays for many people the Internet is replacing regular books. What do you think will happen in the future and what is your opinion about this trend? No Need For Book Stores?,"This era has made people rely on the internet heavily in obtaining information. It seems that many individuals have lost their interest in using books as their main reference because the web has many features to offer. Nevertheless, I believe that there will be still some individuals who will regard books as very important source of data in the future. Ċ Internet has become ubiquitous and essential in many aspects of people's lives because it offers many features. Evidently, the net plays a big role in many individuals, may it be in schools, offices or at home. For instance, generally, students first rush to internet cafes instead of going to libraries to do research. Majority of the students prefer searching the web because it is faster and offers latest news and ideas. Moreover, compare to carrying heavy books, many people find it comfortable to bring small gadgets with internet access. Ċ Nevertheless, many bookstores are still productive with their sales because some individuals find books to be important. For example, many best seller book authors choose not to put all information on the web for their books to profit. Moreover, some people love to collect their favorite series of books which they can read over and over again while others prefer giving self-help books as presents. There are also many history books that gives concrete and more accurate information, especially if the authors are reliable. In addition, unlike books, with technical problems,web information that are saved in computers can be erased and not retrieved. Ċ To conclude, the trend of using the internet more than books has become popular nowadays; however, I strongly believe that books will not completely vanish in the future. Many people will still prefer using printed data because it offers complete, accurate and reliable information."
10635,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Laptop is a thing that is the most necessary for students to help their learning process. Use specific reasons and example to support your answer.,"Most of students think that laptop is the first thing that should they have to help their learning process at formal educations or non-formal educations. They should have a laptop even they live in cloistered villages if they take on learning process, but not all of do them have enough financial to buy it. So, how they can be finishing their duty if to finish it needs laptop? Well, if they do not have laptop to be finishing their duty needs laptop they can go to warnet or they can borrow it with their friends. Ċ First of all, laptop can make easy students to get information, theory, knowledge, sharing, etc. It is one of functions as reason why students should have laptop. For instance, if we need to know about anything like what is the simple way to improve and easy to understand what we learn, and no one knows about it. If you have laptop, and yours connect with internet you just need to type what you want to know in search engine of Google, Yahoo, Bing, Wikipedia, Encyclopedia, etc. Ċ Second of all, students can read e-book in laptop. Not only general e-books that are provided by provider, but there are also kinds of e-books of school or campus subject that we can get. Furthermore, students no need to bring many books if they go to school or campus, but they just bring their laptop. Ċ All in all, laptop very will help everyone especially for students to help them in learning process and to load less that they bring when they go to school or campus."
10636,"Establishing good relationship in the workplace is not important, as the primary goal of person is to focus on work. Ċ To what extent do you agree with this statement?","It is commonly argued that the primary goal of everyone is to focus on his/her job duties, while, being on good terms with colleagues is not essential. Although I agree that being productive is more important than trying to befriend at work. I think that is advantageous to have a few friends in the workplace. Ċ On the one hand, maintaining good relations with all co-workers is often hard and even counter-productive. Firstly, it is emotionally demanding to forge friendships with office colleagues. It is almost impossible to cater for every colleague’s needs and interests, be nice even with people who irritate you while work and put you in trouble. Moreover, sometimes it is wiser to eschew the niceties in the favor of productivity. For instance, if everyone tries to build good relationships with co-workers at the job, there are chances less work would be done. Ċ On the other hand, there are many certain reasons to get closer to your teammates. First of all, it will be beneficial to build warm relationships with those who surround you all the time. Many full-time employees spend their time with colleagues than they suppose to do with their families. And thus, they are usually happier than their solitary peers. Secondly, good interpersonal relations results in good teamwork. It is often believed that team members who like and respect each other tend to collaborative on projects more efficiently. Ċ In conclusion, I believe we need to find a healthy balance between being productive at work and forming a social bond. The ideal option is to find friends in the workplace, but not at the cost of our own productivity."
10637,It has been noted that many people who had a big impact on the world gave themselves completely to their work and did not bother with the idea of “work-life balance”. To what extent should people try to have a good work-life balance?,"One of the most conspicuous trends of today's world is a colossal upsurge in the number of people believing that by spending too much time on the work leads to an issue of work-life balance all over the world. There is a wide range of factors that accounts for why this is happening. Although, this has a plethora of reasons yet this situation can be remedied provided that effective measures can be taken. Ċ There are myriads of reasons for this soaring concern, unlike everyday problems which can be dealt with easily, shortage of time , which is extremely perilous that can lead to an array of issues as the growth of children and relationship problem. For instance, nowadays, in cut-throat competition in corporate sectors, employees spend much their time in office. Consequently, they are not able to sit and enjoy with their families which leads to relationship problems. Thanks to the aforementioned predicaments, it is not only people but can society suffers immensely. Ċ Steps to deal with this problem are many, but most ones in fact that not only remote and complicated but practicable and accessible. The primary one stems from the facts that by ensuring the implementation of facts and policies, government authorities can help a nation thrive. Besides, international organizations and local authorities should take all necessary initiatives cumulatively. To exemplify it, when convergent efforts from all the sectors are enured, only then we can see the progress in curbing the problems. Ċ To conclude, dealing with work-life balance is the most effective prevalent that faces people in all parts of the world. Nevertheless, concrete steps discussed above can effectively strengthen the fight against and alleviate this growing complication. Its potential impact is too dire to ignore."
10638,"In many developing countries, there is an increasing movement of workers from rural areas into the cities. Ċ Why do you think this happens? What problems can this cause?","Movement of workers from rural to urban areas is becoming a very predominant phenomenon in developed nations. I believe the concentration of employment opportunities is the principal factor causing this relocation of people who are in search of jobs. Due to the mentioned issue, the members of the many families suffer separation. Also, villages do not get further developed with enhanced work possibilities since the people who can really contribute move to towns. Ċ Firstly, in cities,there are widespread job availabilities in all possible domains because of the ever-changing lifestyle and high competition. Competing with counterparts, people set up businesses and hence, to proceed forward with their venture they need skilled as well as unskilled workers. Since it is really hard to keep moving with a few shoulders while expanding. The business owners even become ready for good pay which in turn becomes a great attraction for people moving from villages to cities. For example, according to a statistical survey in 2019, the number of villagers who moved to the urban areas were recorded to be 40% of the rural population. Ċ The movement to make ends meet may sound essential,however, leaves many children separated from their parents, moreover, they can not enjoy the parental care which should have been bestowed on them and therefore, they feel the sense of being left out. For instance, According to a Social science department study,it was revealed about 25% of the families got separated as a consequence of such migration. In addition to the aforementioned , because of people relocating from rural regions, the development of work opportunities is impacted due to the lack of minds and labour. Ċ To summarize, I opine employment to earn drives the migration from rural to urban leaving aside the families apart and villages undeveloped in terms of job avenues."
10639,Some people say success in a person's life as an adult is the result of the way he was brought up by his parents. Do you agree or disagree? father's and mother's contribution to a child success,"The success of a person's life is regarded to be a result of the way he was brought up by his parents. In my opinion, I personally agree with this idea, and I will explain why. Ċ On the one hand, regarding the importance of parents, it is undeniable that these mothers and fathers play a vital role in children's development, both mental and physical aspects. To ensure their children having a bright future, parents these days are taking their son and daughters to many academies, including mandatory schools, talent institutions and sports clubs, resulting in pushing the process of seeking for their strength. These talented abilities, ranging from playing musical instruments and sports to be excelled in mathematics, are proved to have significant effects on a person's successful career. It is notable, for example, that there are numerous people are capable of utilizing their strength to make way for success, as we see in Mozart, the pianist with talented skills denoted by his father, and Shinzo Abe, the vice president of Japan who is persuaded by his parent to be a politician. Ċ On the other hand, though, a person's living environment is sometimes believed to have impacts on his future. For example, if a child grows up in a neighborhood where citizens are members of criminal crews, he will likely end up a gangster. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that parent is crucial to a person's successful life, since fathers and mothers help to find their children talents."
10640,"The consumption of the world's resources ( oil, and water, etc.) is increasing at a dangerous rate. What are the causes and solutions?","Natural resources over-use is a challenging problem in today's world that need to be put into consideration. There are a variety of reasons behind this, yet there are viable measures to mitigate this resources over-consumption phenomenon. Ċ First and foremost, the advancements in technology, development and research in the contemporary era increase the exploitation of minerals and raw materials. In addition, a rapid and consistent increase in the population expands the needs for resources; as a result, the resources would also be excessively exploited for business purposes. Finally, the forest areas which are the source of valuable materials for medicine and food are being cleared for farming industries. This would lead to the extinction of many wild species and also responsible for natural disasters such as flooding and drought. Ċ Measures should be taken in order to deal with this severe problem. One possible solution is that the government should educate people with the sustainable use of natural resources. Furthermore, renewable energy such as solar and wind power can be explored more and utilized to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel which can also reduce the amount of toxic emission into the environment. Last but not least, conservation projects such as growing trees or Earth hour should be often held to spread the messages of natural resources preservation and raise awareness of people. Ċ To summarize, the depletion of natural resources is the human being's problem that needs to be resolved. However, it can hardly be solved by only the government's work. It takes a great deal of effort from both the authority and individuals."
10641,Some people claim that many things that children are taught at school are a waste of time. Other people argue that everything that children study at school is useful at sometime. Ċ Discuss the both views and give your opinion.,"What should and should be not a part of school curriculum, has always been a debatable issue. In the viewpoint of some people, certain subjects like history and art taught to the students, have no practical use in real life and hence should not be included as a part of the education, while others are of diverse opinion. I, believe that every course learnt at a younger stage, adds value to the kid's life in one way or the other. This essay will analyse both the views as well as provide a logical conclusion. Ċ On one hand, opponents of history, art and similar subjects, believe that pupils already have enough on their plate and therefore, the courses that are unlikely to be useful, in their future, should be excluded from the syllabus. For instance, the social studies mainly contain information about the past life of the man on the planet and the wars that took place in the yesteryears. However, today's theme is totally different from the last few decades, and wars are almost impossible, which makes the learning quiet irrelevant. Additionally, according to this group, creative courses like art and crafts, are only useful to the young minds, talented in that area, as they can pursue a career in the specific field, sometime in future. But, making these subjects mandatory for everyone, just increases the academic burden on the pupils. Ċ On the other hand, the individuals who opine that everything learnt in school, is helpful to the minors at some stage, argue that even though the facts and figures learnt from any topic might not be directly applicable in real circumstances, they might be useful indirectly. To cite an example, even though reading about the battles between the Mughals and Sultans, seems a waste of time, it enlightens a child about the disasters, humankind can face due to the wars. Moreover, it also gives an idea about the culture as well as the traditions of the nation to him/her. To illustrate it, often the books describe the Kings, queens and their kingdoms before the anecdotes, which is an insight into the ancient day rituals. Furthermore, painting and drawing, assist the younger ones in channelising their negative emotions, such as jealousy and frustration, which can reduce incidents of bullying in schools. Ċ To conclude, all subjects taught in educational institutions, help in the all-round development of the kids in one way or another. In my view, it is baseless to believe that certain things are a waste of time, as each topic imparts knowledge about different areas and aids the curiosity of fresh minds."
10642,"Some people believe that electronics should not be allowed in school until after the pupils have mastered mental arithmetic. Others believe that calculators save pupils time, especially with complicated calculations. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Indeed, nowadays counting is not a complicated thing to do, because technology has provided electronic way which is called calculator. While some people believe that calculator could help children's study, is it a helpful thing for a student in the school? I believe there are some benefit or drawbacks which are needed to see further. Ċ Generally, calculator is human's best friend. This device could solve calculation faster than manual fashion by using machine which has formula. That is why students also tend to bring calculator to school to help them in arithmetic or mathematics subject. Some schools believe that calculator is modern fashion which has a helpful formula to do student task. However, I believe this is not a good thing to use, because students will attract them to be a lazy pupil, and this tool could influence them to have no curiosity to do exercise and homework. Ċ Obviously, learning arithmetic is needed. This is because when a student could master the arithmetic, they could be smart people in basic calculation which could create a new formula which could be implemented in technology. Moreover, I think because final exam or national examination is forbidden to bring, so it is good for student to study and practice more arithmetic further, then they could pass the final or improve academic performance. Ċ In conclusion, I presume that although calculator is a helpful thing for student, but it is not appropriate to be used in school, and it is better to enhance arithmetic further. I also think that arithmetic also could be a challenge for a student to be more creative."
10643,More and more people are leaving the countryside and moving to cities. Do the advantages of this trend outweighs the disadvantages.,"A growing number of people are moving from rural to urban centres. Although relocating to cities has its own downsides, However, I believe the upsides which include access to adequate amenities and employment opportunities far outweigh the disadvantages. Ċ The benefits of living in urban areas cannot be overemphasized.To begin with, one of the advantages is that there are diverse jobs in Metropolitan.In other words, there are vast companies and organisation where people can work ,so that they can earn a living for themselves and their families.To illustrate this, A Recent report in Adelaide Company in Port Harcourt showed that 80% of their employees are from remote areas. Another important advantage is that there is access to good infrastructures in urban centres.These include standard health facilities, a good transport system, proper water and waste disposal ,clean water and good education. Thus,all this would bring about a good standard of living for the residents. Ċ Turning to the downsides,the challenges one can encounter include a lack of housing. This is because the centres are overpopulated, so the houses are not sufficient enough to accommodate the larger proportion of people. For instance, a lot of people living in Lagos are without accommodation, so most sleep at the bridge side and other available places after the day work. In addition, there could be widespread communicable diseases in city centres .This is because it is overcrowded, so there is inadequate ventilation for the urban dwellers. Ċ In conclusion, an increasing number of individuals migrate to urban from rural areas.While there are demerits to this trend, In my opinion, the merits which include accessibility to proper facilities and diverse occupations supersede the drawbacks."
10644,Nowadays artificial intelligence is being used to drive cars. Why is this happening? Is it positive or negative development?,"Over the past few years, self-driving cars have been becoming quite common by dint of the emergence of artificial intelligence. It is due to the advent of futuristic technology, and it denotes a welcoming developmental as it immensely improves road safety. Ċ In contemporary society, modern technology has excelled in all fields, including the automobile industry. Scientists have designed computer systems that can control different functions of cars. To be detailed, specific data is installed in the core systems, which not only monitors its smooth drive,Remove the commaapplyThe comma before the conjunction but also appears to be unnecessary. Consider removing it. Ċ show examples but also continually provides updates via the global positioning system for the chosen route. Besides, intelligence demonstrated by machines can think instead of a human and select an appropriate algorithm by analysing the best efficient solutions for driving purposes. Therefore, several car companies tend to avail of artificial intelligence. For instance, a famous car brand named Tesla has designed automated self-control vehicles that are becoming desirable for their precision, accuracy, and safety. Ċ Machine intelligence should be welcomed owing to the possibility of reducing the number of road traffic accidents. It is scientifically that most collisions are in light of human mistakes, but with the help of AI devices, people will probably eliminate the potential of involving in accidents. This means incidents, such as drunk driving, falling asleep at the wheel and speeding, become a thing of the past. Hence, drivers will not be nervous and feel a sense of protection. For example, most of the Tesla autonomous cars' drivers state that they feel comfortable and have never been in trouble related to car accidents. Ċ In conclusion, the emergence of computer-controlled transportation has been inevitably becoming the new standard in the car industry. Because the technologies are developing in the right way, I uphold the conviction that this trend is a positive impact as it would improve traffic safety standards."
10645,Technology has changed the way people communicatr today. Some people belive this is making our relationship stronger while others believe it is harming them. Discuss both points of view and give your own opinion.,"The current technological advancements have altered the process of sharing information among the crowd.In this context, a few individuals believe that these are helpful for companionships ,whereas, others opine that they are giving a negative impact on the community.I am inclined towards the former view. The aim of the essay is to review both the standpoints and elaborate on my opinion. Ċ To begin with, I support the prospect that modern scientific inventions are helping to strengthen our relationships due to the following reasons.Firstly, it is because of the modern science outputs that we are now able to maintain a smooth companionship with our distant relations.Thus we are able to be in touch with me through these electronic devices.For instance, mobile has decreased the distance and improved the communication mechanisms with our far relatives.As a result of this, we can now call anyone in the world anytime.Secondly, Internet has become a platform to message our childhood friends.In other words, without this technological enhancement, it would have been impossible to get in touch with the public who are almost vanished from our lives.Therefore I am in support of this view. Ċ On the other hand,some opine that current updates in science are outsourcing many threats to public relations.This is because many of the public are being trapped in false friendships on social media and making their life hell.For example, the internet is a global media and anyone can easily contact the other and start a companionship.As a consequence, the population is sometimes getting dragged into narrow-minded and dishonest relationships.Hence, some individuals feel that technology is harming the population. Ċ To conclude, the essay has discussed both viewpoints and the people's objectives behind those statements.However, I feel that technology is helping us to strengthen our relations.Overall, I am more inclined towards the people holding the former view."
10646,children's excessive habit of gaming Topic: Today many children spend a lot of time on playing computer games and little time on sports. Why is it? Is it a positive or negative development?,"Children nowadays dedicate a significant part of their time to video games instead of physical activities. This phenomenon stems from a host of factors, ranging from the improvements in game design to the negligence of parents. I opine that this development would be detrimental to a child's growth. Ċ Game designers are striving to keep their players online for longer and parents appear reluctant to address this. Online games now have great visuals, a fascinating storyline, and a reward system, which makes playing games more appealing than playing sports. Specifically, gamers can gain instant rewards without going out and draining their bodies. Parents are also to blame as they give their offspring the permission and the tools. For example, Vietnamese parents are being heavily criticized for permitting their children to use smartphones nonstop, in return for their obedience, such as finishing their meals. Ċ Excessive gaming impacts children negatively. Firstly, they may not engage in healthy social interactions, hence their lack of social skills in the future. Studies have suggested that real-life interactions help to hone children's soft skills and adapt their behaviors to social norms, which is critical to their competence in adulthood. Additionally, spending to much time on games adversely affect children's health. Heavy focus on computer games instead of working out would not only impair the body's growth but also severely affect mental stability. Ċ In conclusion, parents' carelessness and sophisticated game technologies are the culprits for children's excessive habit of gaming. Young individuals should be restricted to playing games less and be encouraged to engage in sports with their peers, as it benefits their social life and wellbeing."
10647,Some people says that the universities must only accept students with high mark. Others believe that universities must accept students off all ages regardless of their previous grades. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"University education has become a popular topic among people. While many people believe that the educational institutions must solely admit top-scorers, others think that all ages students irrespective of the previous grades which they held must be accepted. As well as offering my personal opinion, this essay will discuss of these views, and shows why universities must ultimately give priority to high-achievers, but why the accessibility of university education has its benefits. Ċ On the one hand, there are growing number of people who believe that only students who have higher grades must be accepted by universities. Students who are with high mark spend their valuable time to enter into a top university instead of playing video games, watching TV. Worse, they suffer from physical and mental problems during this preparation process. For instance, today, many students, who desire to get into a university which has a reputation, cope with a high level stress, anxiety, posture problems, losing weight, parental pressure and more, which cause of excessive studying. Therefore, undoubtedly, only the top scorers must be admitted by universities. Ċ On the other hand, universities must be made accessible to all, irrespective of their previous marks, according to some. The main reason behind this idea is that they think that a fresh graduate who holds a diploma can easily find a job. For example, 30% of British graduates are currently working in jobs that require a degree. For these reasons, there are a number of people who believe that universities must be accessible to everyone. Ċ In conclusion, having a degree is a common desire among people. This essay clearly has discussed why only the top scorers must be ultimately admitted to universities, and why these educational institutions should be accessible to everyone. In my opinion, universities must only accept students with high grades because these students strive to get into universities after a high level of determination as required by the competitive nature of the job market."
10648,"Educating young people is naturally important. However, some think governments ought to invest more education for adults in need. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people believe that state government should allocate their budget to educate the young generation while others argue that oldsters should become a priority target who receives the learning process. I am completely convinced of the former argumentation since youngsters take a crucial part in the development process of the nations and have many chances to explore many new-fashioned fields. Then, I would elaborate on these rationalizations in the forthcoming paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, the future of the countries is fully determined by juveniles who are growing nowadays. Furthermore, they would be a leader in their chosen sectors. So that is why authorities should prepare their human resources appropriately by providing many suitable programmes to encourage them to be an expert in their various subjects. This phase will lead them to obtain many-valued experiences which can elevate human resources in their countries. Research conducted by the University of Helsinki in 2018 showed that the Scandinavian countries are known as educationally focused states in a lot of diverse levels attaining the economic goal quickly rather than other developing nations. This result elucidates that education held a vital role in the advancement of a region. Ċ Moving to another reason, teenagers have many new chances to develop themselves in the cutting-edge era. Moreover, advanced technology acquires world societies to be suitable in the abrupt alterations so that the communities who do not fit in this situation will fall behind. In addition, adolescents can explore up-to-date knowledge to enrich their specific abilities where they can fill the difficult challenges in the upcoming years with their skills. Hence, it will offer a bright future to their homelands. For instance, the youngest can learn deeper about data science to operate artificial intelligence where it is projected will replace humans to do their occupations. Ċ To sum up, the public has different ideas about giving education to the mature and immature. However, I totally vote for adolescents who are gained more grants to study instead of old people due to the fact they will be flourished in various ways and answer the obstacles related to technology."
10649,"Over the last few decades, the media has projected the image of women as young and thin. What problems has this caused? What solutions can you suggest to this? a pattern of beauty and its impact on women","Nowadays, the beauty of woman is measured by how young and slim their body are. This is led by a massive advertisement using woman as an object. Overall, it will lead woman to follow the trend and create health issues. Thus, there should be some aids from all around to solve these issues. Ċ It is noticeable that due to the artificial perspective of beauty, more and more woman want to be skinnier and less-aged. They put effort to follow the beauty standa by plastic surgery, cosmetic medicine and many more. This demand has become an obsession, and this is not as simple as we think because obsession come with a consequence that if it is not fulfilled. Cintia, an actress from my country always be forced to be beautiful by netizen, trapped to follow trend and has gotten her nose job for over five times in order to get a younger shaped face. Yet, instead of become more beautiful, she is now depressed as she fell ashamed to her fail surgery. And this phenomenon happen to other woman all over the world. Hence, an education about self-confident and loving ourselves the way we are, must be done in this crucial level. This will minimalize the dissatisfaction of the way they look as they are getting older. Ċ It is also evident that more women face health issues due to the overused cosmetic as they want to be beautiful. Even woman in young ages, practice unhealthy diet in order to be thinner. My friend is suffered from anorexia as she consumes dietary medicine. I believe the parents must carefully watch and keep their children from this phenomenon. Ċ To sum up, I really urge a careful education and support from family to tackle these effects of the media's designed-beauty standard."
10650,"Question Many shops work for 24 hours a day 7 days a week; some people see it as a good idea, while others don't. Compare different views of customers, shop workers and the whole society of this subject and give your opinion about it. Answer","Nowadays, shops work for twenty four hours and seven days a week to get more profit. Some people think that is a good notion and others discord with it. In this essay, I will explore the statement based on customers, shop workers and whole society. Ċ According to customers view, it is immense advantage for customers if shop opens for twenty four hours a week. In emergency, they can buy medicines at the midnight. For example, recently my cousin infected with wheezing problem and he struggle for breathing at night and prescribed medicine is over at home. On that time his father went to medical shop and buy medicines for him. It is an enormous advantage in emergency period. Ċ On the other hand, according to shop workers view, it is a great disadvantage for shop workers if they work for more hours that result in stress and anxiety. Moreover there will not be much customers result in more use of man power electricity and it lead to loss of the company. For example, my neighbor shop works all twenty four hours due to greediness and there is no profit at night time result in close of shop due to insufficient fund. Ċ In addition, based on whole society it is useless to open shops at midnight there will be less or no customers for the shopkeeper. People will sleep at night so no one comes for shopping. Ċ In a nutshell, by comparing customers, shop workers and whole society view it is unnecessary to open a shop at night it will be a significant loss to the shop keeper. Only at emergency time need a shop but if people should buy their items in advance at the day time itself which result in wealthy and prosperous world."
10651,WRITING TASK 2 The ownership of cars should be restricted to one per family in order to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It might be true that private automobile owner reflect wealth status of individual. A number of private automobile has soared since a decade ago, yet it has produced traffic congestion and some pollution. Based on that issues, I totally agree if the number of own car per house is limited and I will discuss the reasonable reason in the following paragraphs. Ċ The first, the overwhelming number of private automobile is not synergy with the large of roads. It becomes the primary factor of traffic jam since the roads being overcrowded, which contributing most of people spend their time in the road. The capital city of Indonesia, for instance, has occurred increase of traffic congestion annually due to individual car possess. In consequence, traffic jam is able to make late either for students or workers. Indeed, it takes up amount of their energy. Therefore, it is vital to strict the number of car in a house (a car per house) in order to reduce the traffic congestion. Ċ Look at to the other consequence, the high number of car private contributes the amount of pollutions, particularly air pollution. As people know that gas emission from fuel are contain numerous gasses which is dominated by carbon dioxide. Breathing carbon dioxide up is eminent in case human's organ damage. Moreover, pollution is capable of accelerating the human's aging, making people seem like older than the actual age. So, limitation of car owner is the one of ways to make a fall the amount pollution. Ċ To sum up, people are able to save their time effectively in the road if there is no traffic jam anymore, also they can enhance longevity of life. I absolutely agree if the government create the rules about restriction of number of car per home."
10652,"Some people believe that technology has made men more sociable, and others think that it has made us less sociable. discuss both views? Technology and Socialization","Many people believe that technological advancement has made humans less sociable. Others believe that the opposite is true. Although technology is causing the growing loss of physical communication between people, this essay argues that technological progress has given us an unprecedented number of opportunities to become more sociable. Ċ On one hand, innovations in technology allow us to get anything we want without the need of physical communication to anyone. Various online shopping applications offer a simple click of a button which results in product being delivered to our doorstep in no time. Numerous dating websites have led to the decreasing number of real life dates, where people are too scared to interact with each other face-to-face. A recent research has shown that only 28% of single men agree to go on a real date after getting to know the partner on a dating website. Ċ However, technology now allows people to socialize more, because it removes the variables of distance and time out of the equation. Whereas in the past a person could only send a certain amount of text on paper, because it was costly and it took a long time to be delivered, now one can send an electronic letter of any length. Various social media and websites are aimed at connecting friends and acquaintances together, therefore, building and improving their social skills. My mother, for example, who always refused to attend school anniversary meetings, loves to chat with the same classmates via an online chat. Ċ Some would argue that technology makes us fail at being more social due to the lack of physical interaction, while others believe that it makes us communicate with each other even more. I believe technology helps us socialize better, because it has created so many effective means for it."
10653,"Some people think that strict punishments for driving offenses are the key to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Nowadays, the vehicle ratio increase dramatically than ever before at the same time way casualty is increasing. A fair amount of society thinks that a severe penalty can decrease shipment disaster while others say that take other actions would be more successful in order to develop line safety. I believe strict laws should be there to punish the driving offenders whereas a combination of other methods would bring better results. Ċ To begin with, the severe penalty can diminish the driving crime because the folk can only be afraid of the punishment otherwise is not possible. Some society consciously and subconsciously follows the line rules because they clearly know the fine and punishment when an accident might happen. For example, some western countries government should follow the shipment rules and regulations as a result, the route casualty dead decrease than in Asian country. Ergo, this is the best way to reduce route hazard. Ċ On the other hand, there are already severe punishments for driving offenders including ceasing a driving license, monetary fines and imprisonment. Despite this, the number of lane casualty is increasing every year. This why I believe that only punishments can not ensure lane security and safety. A combination of other initiatives is also required. First, we need to aware of the consequence of the violation can bring our life. Secondly, the requirements of passing the driving test should be standardised and made more practical, especially in developing countries where folk can use the advantages of corruption. It is often noticed that many juveniles are given driving licences without scrutinising their experience and skills. This should be completely avoided and after a certain period, each driver should be retested. Thirdly, unfit vehicles should not be allowed to run on the roads as their cars cause more hazard according to the recent path Transport Authority report. Finally, the transportation system of a country should be modernised and more surveillance cameras and speed test cameras should be there. Ċ To conclude, a penalty to reduce lane violation is a good way to make the path safer whereas the combination of other steps would bring more desired results. In my opinion ,about , both the transportation punishments as well as other actions should be combined to avoid roadway hazard and path safer. This trend is conducive for harmony life."
10654,You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Ċ You should write at least 250 words.,"Teaching connoisseurs throughout the world have debated whether youngsters should be provided musical devices training such as guitar and piano. I strongly agree with the view owing to the fact that it boosts their mental development. This essay will shed light on the matter and provide evidence to prove the arguments. Ċ Several reasons take experts to believe that these skills are fundamental to teenagers. First and foremost, musical apparatus helps children mental and psychological development. In other words, these devices build brain emotions such as emotional imprint, feelings, and desire. For instance, recent research carried out by Cambridge University showcased that 70% of teenagers who experienced guitar playing in earlier stages of their lives were more emotive than those who did not. As a result, it increased their probability to be well-succeeded in future pursuits. Furthermore, it is the overriding motive for increased children intelligence worldwide. Ċ Secondly, sound instruments are the way out to overcome life's challenges. Because of employment shortfall in a plethora of nations, this orientation is seen as the refuge. Let us take African lands as an example, recent investigation by the University of Oxford pointed out that 70% of children followed the branch for surviving reasons. Hence, they encountered a way to suffice their needs and increase their family's income. Moreover, the overwhelming majority of musicians today are in the area solely to sustain their families. Ċ In conclusion, indeed, sound apparatus is worthy for youngsters. For this motive, I strongly agree with the statement. In addition, I would recommend ruling power throughout the planet introduce it in all levels of education and provide assistance for those who certainly want to come into the field as professionals."
10655,Some people think taking care of one's health is not only for individual benefits. It should also be a responsibility for society. To what extent do you agree?,"In the present age, keeping individuals' health are playing increasingly important role in our lives. But at the same time, controversy has arisen whether society should take the responsibility for keeping citizens' health. Someone would argue that maintaining their own health is not only their own responsibility but also society has responsibility to do it. Personally, I think this view overlooks the important factors of this issue. Ċ Convincing arguments can be made that society bearing all responsibilities of their health may carry out some potential risks. First of all, it seems that society may have financial crises. There is ample evidence suggesting that individuals may be overly dependent on the society, which may lead to large amount of expenditures. Moreover, keeping healthy body is their own responsibility. Obviously, people have right to determine that what goes into their own body and their lifestyles. Society is not about to deter their own decisions. Ċ On the other hand, it is worth pointing out there are arguments supporting the opinion that society necessarily takes responsibility for individuals' health. The major idea is assisting impoverished families. It is evident that in terms of health problem needy families are not able to pay for better quality of foods. Therefore, they require society to supporting them, thereby keeping a healthy physique. Despite this, an apparent problem with this opinion is that it may levy higher taxes. Consequently, we should not overlook the fact that in order to cover this huge amount of expenditure, government need to impose high taxes to meet citizens' needs. Ċ By way of conclusion, regarding this issue, my own view is that although it may have a responsibility to help needy to maintain a good health, I firmly believe that keeping healthy physique is the best interests of them. Also, I would argue that it seems highly advisable for individuals to choose healthier lifestyles rather than sedentary lifestyles."
10656,"Topic: ""In certain cultures old age is considered to be more important while in others it's the opposite, children are thought to be more important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.""","Every cultures and society consist of varied mixture of different age group people.Since many years, it has been a controversial topic to identify what age group rendered most towards society welfare. Some people think that young people is indispensable for the development of the society. Whereas, others, whilst may content that older people's contribution towards better society is colossal. Ċ Admittedly, old people holds galore information and invaluable experience in many spheres of life. The fact that they are exposed to the real world for a good amount of year, make them perfectly capable and eligible for upholding the overall responsibility to make the society a better place to live in. Ċ Furthermore , it cannot be denied that old people not only carry imperative qualities such as good morals and ethics, truthfulness, sincerely and respect, but also act as a pristine source in imparting or inheriting such qualities to young people. Moreover, it is also true that adolescents maintain discipline and decorum because they are being controlled and guided by elders. Ċ However, young people are the future of society. It is excepted that younger generation are very assertive in nature, physically and mentally stronger and dedicated to their goals and aims. Since they are recent graduates from colleges, their mind is fresh, capable of innovative and out of box thinking and updated with the latest technological skills and information.Such important qualities are obligatory to boost the society's economy. They are boon to the society. Ċ To sum up, I would concede that people from all age group is important to society.Each age group people has their unique role and hold equal shares of responsibilities towards the progress of society."
10657,"Some believe that younger family members should be legally responsible for supporting older family members when they become physically, mentally and financially unable to look after themselves. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The majority of the population think that elder family members ought to be catered to legitimately by younger family members when they do not look after themselves independently. I do not advocate with the opinion of the majority and am going to reflect my own view. Ċ On the one hand, humans may be gaga or doddery when they become old because of various negative influences and so they do nothing individually like babies. Older people depend on the help of the young generation. In this case, the government should care about the life of older ones. Likewise, the authority should implement new rules that young individuals must be responsible for sustaining their older family members and so special privileges should be created for these family households. Such as, they should be released from different taxes. Additionally, they should be given a certain amount of money. Ċ On the other hand, younger family members should not be legally responsible for looking after older households. Because, if families are poor and do not have enough money to cater to older mankind. They cannot care well, as a result, the quality of older people life may be worsening. Hence, the government should create different entertainment facilities for older mankind. For example, different clubs should be built for older individuals , in this way, they can interact with other their peers. This can help to lose the different health problems. Moreover, older people forget all of their issues and feel more cheerful. Ċ In conclusion, I would stress that I support definitely the statement and my arguments confirm this."
10658,"bioengineered food consumption evaluation Topic: Recently, genetically-modified foods becomes a new solution to agriculture productivity. Discuss the advantage and disadvantages.","In light of technological development, genetically-modified foods which were considered as a substitute to conventional ones have gained prevalence among consumers these days. While these bioengineered foods may offer some disadvantages, I am convinced that these are outweighed by its advantages. Ċ On the one hand, foods produced through genetic modification might exert some negative impacts on both individuals and society. Primarily, people tend to suffer from various health issues when consuming bioengineered foods. This means genetic engineering techniques could trigger abnormal gene groups in food, resulting in some diseases including food allergies and genetic disorders among people. Additionally, genetically-modified foods would require not only diligent research but also testing by scientists to make it safe for human consumption. Such a time-consuming process along with exorbitant expenditure appears to put a great economic burden on society. Ċ However, my view is that there are more benefits associated with these genetically-engineered foods. The fundamental one is that the technology of genetic modification would enable plants to become resistant against diseases and adaptive to environmental changes. As a result, the crops these days are likely to yield a larger quantity of output, thereby ensuring a more sustainable food supply when compared to the past. Another positive aspect is the high nutritional level brought by just a small portion of bioengineered food consumption. For example, in Vietnam, genetically-modified rice with high levels of vitamin A would not only help vitamin deficiency but also reduce the risk of diabetes due to consuming a sufficient amount of rice on a daily basis. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that despite some negative aspects, more positive aspects could be seen in genetically-modified food consumption."
10659,"Computers today can quickly and accurately translate languages, therefore, it is a waste of time to learn a foreign language.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The computer is the most powerful and successful invention in the history of human history. These days, computers translate non-native languages without any error and within fractions of a second, that is why many believe that learning a foreign language is a lost cause, I disagree with this notion for the following reasons. Ċ Firstly, Learning a foreign language is very crucial for the advancement of technology and globalization. This is because computers can not be used for every human interaction. For Instance, a computer can't speak on behalf of human beings and this purpose can only be served when one knows that particular tongue. If one wants to travel to a foreign country then they can't carry any translator or machine with them unless they are aware of that countries' mother tongue. Ċ Secondly, Even though computers can translate texts but they can not serve the purpose of writing any content. The reason for this is that a computer is just a machine that has been designed by us to function as per our needs. Additionally, it can't fulfil the purpose of any corporates dealings where each and every word matter. For example, when multi-national companies sign a business deal, all legalities and other cultural aspects need to be considered very carefully and that can only be done by linguistics. Ċ To conclude, in my opinion, learning a foreign language not only is very important for global trade and the growth of any country but this is also beneficial for citizens to understand others values and cultures which might help them to overcome existing issues."
10660,Healthcare should not be provided for free regardless of a person's income. The health of an individual is in their own hands. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The notion of providing healthcare based on a person’s income is one I do not agree with. Although a person’s health is their own responsibility, basic healthcare needs to be made available to the public. I do not believe in a free healthcare system, but instead, one which is subsidized by the government, thereby protecting the middle and impoverished sections of humanity, whilst at the same time providing equal and fair treatment to the wealthy. Ċ 	To begin with, in many developing countries there are many people living below the poverty line, who are unable to buy basic medicine for treating even the simplest of problems. The main reason for this is the fact that many people are uneducated, and are working low-paying jobs. For example, in Moldova, The rationalization of duplicated specialized services, therefore, remains a key challenge facing the health system. Other challenges include health workforce shortages (particularly in rural areas) and improving equity in financing and access to care by reducing out-of-pocket (OOP) payments. Ċ Secondly, my opinion is further bolstered by the factor that the good health of working employees defines the growth of the nation as employment sectors are largely responsible for proliferating the economy of the country. In this modern and hectic lifestyle, people are working relentlessly in various sectors such as education, health, agriculture, and information technology, as a consequence, the productivity of these areas leads to the development of the nation. Henceforth, to produce a healthy workforce for the betterment of the country, it is important for the government to provide healthcare facilities. The free medical coverage for the native people of the USA serves as the best example of this approach. Ċ In conclusion, while everyone is responsible for keeping themselves fit, in my perspective, the provision of medical subsidies by the government is vital not only for the financially poor people but also for the working professionals to uplift the economy of the country."
10661,The world is changing rapidly. An increasing number of people change their jobs and the places they live frequently. Is this a negative or a positive development?,"As the rapid changing of the modern world, more and more people make their decisions to alter jobs and even their residence currently. This phenomenon, however, has shown more demerits than its merits, as far as I am concerned. Ċ It is undeniable that the popularity of changing jobs and living places has contributed to the whole society greatly in various aspects. For one thing, companies are likely to benefit from the different ideas, advanced techniques and innovative management methods brought by the new employees. For another, moving to another place to live can also encourage the local residents to be more tolerant and promote the cultural communication in social or global dimension. Ċ However, there are apparently wide ranges of negative impacts in terms of frequent changing, which cannot be ignored. In the first place, a great number of corporations loathe losing, hiring and training employees frequently. One of the manifest reasons is that the ripple effect of job-hopping can be quite costly and time-consuming. What is more, losing an employee in relatively high and crucial position may even cause vicious competitions amongst companies in the industry. In the second place, many people moving in and out of an area too often is likely to give rise to a lack of sense of community. Consequently, the local residents may lose the feeling of safety living in this area, which can be regarded as one of the causations of social instability. Ċ To sum up, changing jobs and residences frequently is more likely a negative development in current society than a positive one. Therefore, people should be aware that changing is not an excuse of escaping the reality. It is reasonable only when it can bring a better job or life."
10662,People should follow the customs and traditions when people start to live in a new country. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Life in a foreign country bring some principles,"Some people argue that living in a new country is means that people should learn the customs and traditions of new place. I completely agree with that opinion. Ċ People who live in new country without understanding the customs will have more problems. Firstly, it is difficulties for new residents who do not follow customs a traditions of host country. For example, when people want to start their own business, they have to know local business custom in order to be successful. Secondly, some actions will be illegal in the host country and will make local people anger. For instance, Singapore is the best country about the clean. If new individuals throw the trash on the street, they will be punished and have to pay the fee. Ċ On the other hand, there are a lot of benefits of following local customs and traditions. First of all, it is easily to make friends when new comers understand local customs and traditions. Furthermore, new immigrant will enjoy the traditions and be able to take part in community life. For example, they can participant festival with new friends when they have mutual understanding. Ċ In conclusion, for the reason I mentioned above. I strongly believe that live in new country, people have to know and understand local customs to blend into the host country."
10663,The gap between the rich and the poor The gap between the rich and the poor is getting wider. The rich are getting richer but the poor are getting poorer. What is the reason for this situation and what actions should be taken to fix it.,"In recent years, currency has become a broad issue to the general public. As society advances, there exists a bigger gap between the rich and the poor. Although noticeable, the impact of this issue has not been realized by many residents. Discussed below are several reasons as well as solutions to this phenomenon. Ċ There are some main reasons for the fact that exists a gap between the rich and the poor. To begin with, globalization has affected the world economy. This means that some multi-nationals like McDonald, KFC, and Lotteria which have joined the trend, would earn much more income than others. Therefore, the poor would lag behind and the rich would earn more money. What is more, education is the second reason. This is because of the fact that rich people enjoy various levels of the taxonomy of thinking. They have good live conditions while the poor do not. For example, people live in many rural areas in Vietnam could not afford to go to school. Ċ In order to solve such problems, people should take some certain solutions. One of the most primary solutions is that governments should create job opportunities for poor people and teach them how to survive financially. Furthermore, they should receive some scholarships for empowering their capacities. Admittedly, such solutions would not be implemented in the near future. Yet, they at least deserve our consideration. Ċ In conclusion, the above-mentioned facts have outlined the reasons as well as the measures of this phenomenon. The given suggestions would be a good step towards solving them. Therefore, authorities should have further consideration on this issue."
10664,Many jobs that are done by people are now done by machines and computers. Some people that this is a positive development while others feel this is a negative for society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Due to the advancement of technology, many jobs can now be achieved by the use of machines and computers. This development has a great impact on our society and it is good to know whether this is a positive or a negative tendency. Some people feel that this is an advantageous trend, while others believe that this has negative impacts on our community. Personally, I tend to support the latter approach. Ċ This innovation has made people's life much easier and more convenient. Since robots have replaced many manual labours, employers have the chance not only to save valuable time as the machines do not require any further training, but also to increase their revenues because machines do not demand monthly salaries like humans do. For example, in many grocery stores in the UK, customers can now scan and pay their shoppings in vending machines, resulting the save time on waiting in the queue. This is a clear benefit for the community. Nevertheless, this innovative method can cause dire problems. Ċ Looking on the other side of the coin, robots have significantly increased the rate of poverty and unemployment. Many jobs have been limited due to this innovation and therefore it's more difficult to get employed compared to a few decades ago. For example, from vending machines have been invented many cashiers have been unemployed. Furthermore, these machines consume high amounts of electrical power in order to operate. As a result, this tendency has definitely a negative impact to the environment since electrical power industries pollute the environment for the generation. Ċ To conclude, this innovation has great benefits for our society in one point, but I believe that the disadvantages of this trend outweigh the advantages. High rates of unemployment cause massive problems for the humanity."
10665,Some people are of the opinion that children should be rewarded for good Ċ behaviour. Others think they should be punished for bad behaviour. Discuss both Ċ views and give your personal opinion and reasons.,"The debate over a child’s moral education is difficult because of the various viewpoints each party holds. The question of discipline is exceptionally important, moreover whether to treat good behaviour with a neutral attitude or to just focus on correcting incorrect actions. My personal opinion is that any positive actions ought to be immediately recognized by the parent and vice versa for negative conduct. This balanced approach makes for a more positive outcome for both the child and family. Ċ Firstly, rewarding a good act immediately signals a positive reaction in the child’s brain which should encourage the child to want to behave similarly in the future. Failure to recognize such behaviour leaves the child with the same emotional feeling as if they had done nothing. For instance, research shows that children who were given a treat for good behaviours tend to repeat it five times more than children who weren't. Therefore, rewarding the child regularly for good behaviour enforces the action making it more likely to repeat itself in the future. Ċ Secondly, punishing the son or daughter is also necessary, and failure to discipline could have serious consequences in the future. For example, if a child has no clear concept of respect for elders or authority, it is quite possible to encounter more serious problems later in life. This pattern is prevalent in marginal neighbourhoods throughout the world. Thus, it is essential to immediately discipline the child whenever witnessing an unruly act to enforce the correct behaviour from an early age. Ċ To conclude, both bad and good actions need to be recognized and dealt with immediately to correct or encourage future actions. Failure to do either of these could result in a less fortunate life or youth who rarely performs any good acts for anyone. Hence, it is critical that both types of behaviour are recognized and dealt with accordingly for the benefit of the child in the future."
10666,"Setting into a new culture can be extremely different. Although some culture shock is inevitable, there are a number of ways to make living overseas much easier. Discuss what might be potential problems people might face in a different cultural setting and provide solutions for them.","Every year millions of people all over the world change their locations for several reasons. Some of them migrate to another countries, some visit their relatives and acquaintances and other just travel to see the world. Unfortunately most travelers inevitably have problems with adaptation and face with ""culture shock"". Although it takes a little time to get accustomed to new places and traditions, it can cause some problems and dissents. Ċ Culture shock causes multiple problems both for guests and for hosts. One of the essential problems travelers face with is diversity of religions. For instance, most wide spread religions such as Christianity, Islam and Buddhism have different attitudes to animals and their meat. Christians have no objections to all kinds of animals' meat, while Muslims and Buddhists do. While pork is prohibited in Islam, most Buddhists eat no meat. The only solution is here, it seems, to be more tolerant and not take it serious. Ċ Another concern is disturbance. Most Asian and Latin American people do not pay heed to this situation. They are accustomed to visiting and disturbing for any reason and at any time. Since Americans and Western Europeans are more serious and responsible for receiving guests. They allot special time and if one wants to visit them, he should call them beforehand. In order to evade some troubles and nuisance, travelers ,before traveling, should learn some information and tips about foreigners habits and customs, to watch guide shows or read guidelines. Ċ In conclusion, travelers should be more tolerant and comprehend that every place has its own rules. During travelling respect and appreciate hosts' traditions and customs."
10667,"If you could change something about your hometown, what you would change? Use specific reasons an examples to support your answer overcoming environmental issues","I'm from this city in X called Y. This place is very close to me as I was born and brought up here. I have fond memories associated with this place. However, just like every other city, my city also has some drawbacks, the major problem being the lack of attention paid towards environmental issues. This could be due to several factors such as lack of awareness among people, the rapid increase in population, etc. Ċ Air pollution is one of the major concerns of the city. The city is highly polluted which has severe impact on the people. For instance, due to the high population, the number of vehicles on the streets is also high, that is, each family uses their own mode of transportation mostly. The government should make a solid and better transportation system, by which people will find it easier to transport using public transport instead of private vehicles. They should also educate and bring about plans and agendas to make the public aware about the importance of sustainable development. Ċ Moreover, higher the number of vehicles, higher is the traffic and the noise on the streets. The incessant noise caused by these vehicles can seriously affect our system and cause long term effects. Ċ In addition to that, the system for garbage disposal should be improved. The public should have a sense of awareness and responsibility for proper disposal of waste. Most of the wastes that are thrown are burnt. This includes plastics as well, which further, causes air pollution. So a system has to be brought where people can differentiate between biodegradable and non- biodegradable waste and can ensure proper separation of the wastes so that they can prevent water, soil and air pollution. Ċ In conclusion, if the public and the government put enough effort on their side we can ensure that the issues can be resolved."
10668,"Today, people think that attraction of foreign investment is necessary and important for the development of the economies of the host countries, while the others think that attraction of foreign investment has negative impact on the society and not only on this sphere. Discuss both sides and write your own opinion. Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Some argue that the international influence on the local industry has been a constructive step in the development of the country. However, others disagree by highlighting its detrimental impacts on society as a whole. I hold the point of view that foreign capital is extremely crucial for the progress of a nation and I shall elaborate on it further in the essay. Ċ First of all, according to some, foreign investments bring significant funds inside a country which opens new ways of earning. For example, it creates more job opportunities for the youngsters and also provide opportunities to establish their personal business, as basic necessities are always fulfilled by the locals to run an industry. Additionally, a huge amount of money comes in which could stabilize and support the economy in the long run. Hence, it is absolutely obvious that such involvement of foreign bodies holds a myriad of benefits for the nation. Ċ On the contrary, others emphasize that the money from these sources would damage the culture and the traditional ways of manufacturing goods. which means to say that the modern ways of manufacturing and producing products could affect the local business. For instance, the automation industry could diminish the demand for locally produced products and handicrafts as the latest machines can produce the same in a lot faster way. Furthermore, the externals might be the ones using the local resources and earing from it, rather than the citizen of it. Thus, the long-term effects of it could be deteriorating for society. Ċ In conclusion, the people's opinions on the consequences of extern investments had been discussed in this essay regarding its importance in the progress of a country and its negative impacts as well. I believe that the contribution of the businessmen from outside is always beneficial in a plethora of ways, namely, ease of doing business and providing the employment opportunities to the locals."
10669,Topic: Fashion trends are diffcult to follow these days and it is widely believed that they primarily exist just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"In modern society, the increasingly amounts of clothing advertisement and model show imply that fashion trends is going to be an essential factor in our life. Personally, it seems to me that it is only a promotion strategy and we should dress in what we like rather than simply follow it. Ċ Socially speaking, everyone should have a sense of self-awareness before deciding to follow any popular trends. In other words, it is people themselves instead of designers that should choose what they wear every day. Because fashion designs primarily exist as a form of creative artistic expression of the designer. Obviously, they are not designed for a particular person or community. If one ignores this important truth, he/she would likely be a victim of fashion. Further, from a perspective of individuality, everyone has his/her own personality, identity, and preference, which leads to a diverse world. However, this diversity will significantly lose if people follow the same stylish trends and hence choose similar colour and clothing. Also, economically, following fashion trends frequently means put a heavy burden on people's budget, which is absolutely not a smart idea in today's recessionary conditions. Ċ Admittedly, some people still believe that stylish clothing is a necessity in daily life. They argue that people should dress their up-to-date suites for formal occasions such as wedding and theatre. Also, they particular believe that fashion clothing is requirements for all singers and actors because themselves are symbols of fashion. Ċ In conclusion, I would argue that it is unnecessary for most people to follow the latest clothing trends in their daily life. They only need to prepare several popular clothing for particular occasions. In terms of megastars, however, I believe their careers require them to put emphasis on current clothing trends."
10670,"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age. Ċ Do you agree or disagree? Ċ Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 254 words.","Arguably, boxing is regarded as a blood game several times ends up in body damage. Yet its critics contend its existence nowadays. Personally, I disagree with the view since those who practice the sport freely choose the game. Albeit, many are in the sport solely for money and fame. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments. Ċ On the one hand, the practitioners are not forced to follow the field. In other words, despite its injuries seriously the athletes, it is not an obligatory game. For instance, the international boxing federation provides written approval for gamers to consent to their participation as well as handle the aftermaths. As a result, criticising the development is a waste of time and no one has the responsibility to deal with it. Moreover, the foremost accountable for it are sporters and no one else. Ċ On the other hand, A significant number of sporters are in the game solely because of a huge amount of money in it. It undoubtedly threatens them since many of them shortfall of quality causing several injuries. Furthermore, a plethora of boxers is seriously wounded and found on the brink to die due to this. For example, 3 out 10 pugilists undergo surgery every seasonal fortnight. Hence, rather than earning big money, they end up in intensive care. Ċ In conclusion, notwithstanding some participants being in the game simply because it pays well, the critics should be aware of the rules, which keeps the freedom of choice for the athletes. Therefore, I still disagree with the view. In addition, I recommend that the world-ruling power allows the practice today."
10671,"Very few school children learn about the value of money and how to look after it, yet this is a critical life skill that should be taught as part of the school curriculum. Do you agree or disagree?","A small number of youngsters are aware of the importance of finances and how to manage them even though they are used in every aspect of our society. A commonly held belief is that the management of money should be included as a school subject. In this essay, I am going to elaborate on the topic and show my approval. Ċ To begin with, the management of money is a crucial life skill. The majority of people are taught how to work with technologies and how to solve difficult mathematical equations. On the other hand, a truly valuable competence , which worth managing undoubtedly is, has been left out of the curriculum. For example, if a person studies abroad, they will be unable to look after their expenses. They will need to take credits, which can become a future burden if they haven’t acquired the skill of managing bank credits. Ċ Secondly, we cannot neglect that children should be taught about taking responsibility for their own finances. For instance, if a child does not acknowledge the importance of wealth, they will grow into an unresponsible adult who spends money without considering the circumstances. This is a huge problem in our society even nowadays. Many people are involved in high - priced addictions such as shopping spree, hazard playing, etc. However,this can be prevented or at least reduced provided that children are taught about how to look after their expenses. Ċ To summarise, I firmly believe that the value of money should be taught at school. By doing this, the government ensures that young adults can deal with everyday financial problems and that they can take responsibility for their actions. Consequently, a bigger part of the population will acknowledge the power of wealth, which will lead to a better understanding of important financial skills."
10672,Many parents give jobs to their children to do around the house in order to develop their characters and self-sufficiency. Ċ Discuss this idea and give your opinion. Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays, the offsprings have been trained on household chores to become self-reliant and a great human being. In my opinion, this is the best way to nurture a child to face future challenges and plus develop the trait of being caring and tidy throughout life. Ċ The moral duties need to be inculcated in the offsprings from their childhood; not only help them to become a responsible citizen but also educate them about the importance of being clean and hygiene. These elements are essential for any human being to fulfil their social responsibilities. For example, the Quen Elizabeth III had taught her son ""Prince Charles"" to clean the floor and do your own dishes since childhood to make sure he realized the vitality of the household assistance they get from their servants. Hence, to make your youth a true gentleman or gentle lady, it is vital to let them learn the real realms of existence. Ċ Not only that, the majority of the adolescent from average income family group, migrates to big cities for better career opportunities. They can not afford daily maids or domestic help, as these services are even more expensive. Henceforth, the childhood learning they received from their parents has come to rescue in these situations such as cooking, cleaning, mobbing, and others. It is quite a challenge for them if they are not being trained in these areas, but if they being through life-chapter in their young age then they can easily overcome this rough patch of livelihood as they had developed a skill of how to be self-reliant and self-sufficient in an early age. For example, a survey conducted by the "" Oxford University"" had stated that 80% immigrants from rural areas are youngsters those who are in search of jobs and majority of them doing their domestic work of their own to save money. Thus, it is proven that once self-trained, they hardly need any domestic-help. Ċ In conclusion, most of the guardians get their home task done by their youth. It is essential in my opinion to make them understand that no work is small or disregarded and more so, allow them to overcome the constraints in their life."
10673,computers are becoming an essential part of education discuss the advantages and disadvantages and give your own opinion. write at least 250 words.,"With the development of telecommunication devices, computers are gradually used as a necessary tool for a part of education. By taking advantage of technological services, students will extensively utterlise computers as a partner during their educational career, though there are several drawbacks to consider. Ċ The greatest benefit of using computers for education is that students have more opportunities to expand the research network for their thesis. Instead of reading a plethora of books related to topics for many days, now computers make it possible for them to approach many useful sources of information in a flash. By this way, students somewhat have more time to focus on and do multiple tasks at the same time that is otherwise impossible if they chose to read. Ċ However, spending such a long time using computers in education may cause some students to do sth wrong with the purpose of teachers and gain bad marks then. Some students may be tempted into social networking sites and browsing the Internet while teachers do not pay attention. For example, when studying Computer Science, my friends are always playing games behind their teacher's back, which oftentimes they become addicted and perform badly on their exams. Ċ To sum up, using computers in education has become incredibly common around the world. While most people make use of them as a great tool, there are in fact some disadvantages that stop the development of these equipment. In my opinion, it is the hardship that applying technological devices to education is much more advantageous than disadvantageous."
10674,Some psychologists think that the best way to overcome stress of everyday life is to spend a portion of the day doing absolutely nothing. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Who does not want time to relax and chill out? US famous article stated that the best method to relieve daily stresses is to have a break time to relax and do nothing. Although calm and relaxation have a positive impact to overcome stresses, I believe that there are other ways to relieve them. Ċ To begin with, there is no doubt that everyone needs time to relax and relieve daily tensions in his or her mind. One reason for this is that stress can jeopardize our bodies and mental health. For instance, if a person works constantly and there is no time to settle down he or she will be affected severely. Our bodies and minds necessitate a break time from life strains. In addition, setting down and doing absolutely nothing for hours can intensify stress. To illustrate this, when someone does nothing for hours daily that will affect him negatively. one friend of mine used to set after work do nothing that affected him and he is now seeking a psychiatrist. Ċ However, one of the most effective methods to overcome stress is exercise and workouts. Exercises do not only have health benefits also, can improve mental status drastically. For example, when you do different types of workouts your mind will be distracted and blood circulation increases that lead to thinking better. Furthermore, meditation and recreation as well are helpful. Studies show that meditation and observation have a precious impact psychologically. Ċ In conclusion , despite the positive impact of spending a portion of the day relaxing and doing nothing, we should do other methods to overcome our stressful days such as sports, cooking , and meditation."
10675,"Some think that it is better to get information or advice from other people, while others believe one can get any information or advice from the Internet or books. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","Getting information from the masses regarding some significant matters is recommended by a few people, while some argue, that attaining awareness online as well as from academic records is more efficient. Although, experienced individuals suggested to others by their own personal facts, I personally believe, that the data which is collected through the internet is widely known. Let's delve into detail. Ċ To begin with, sometimes a person needs assistance in their hard time period, then a lot of human beings provide ideas to get out from that critical situation, in that cases if the most valuable thoughts would be implemented, then the majority of hurdles would be reduced. community health centres, for instance, are providing a plethora of treatments to their patients, there is no need to go to other hospitals for tertiary level treatment, indeed that kind of information is only given by those who go through such kinds of ways. Moreover, during the time of choosing the carrier, most of the students discuss it with their tutors and select a better line. Thus, assistance is demanded by an experienced creature. Ċ Secondly, no doubt mankind plays a significant role in advising, but the contemporary sources of knowledge could not be denied. There are ample sources ,for example, U-TUBE, is a medium through which a lot of people share their experience and serve a wider knowledge. If we need information regarding some pivotal issues then we can approach these videos and solve our solutions. Furthermore, instead of minor knowledge, we can believe in hyperspace data. Ċ In conclusion, whilst our elders' proposals are helpful, According to my perspective, we should give more preference to online data, where huge hints could be seen and one could be selected, which is high on the rating scale."
10676,It is a common aspiration between many young people to run their own business rather than work for an employer. Do you think the advantages of working for yourself outweigh the drawbacks?,"Being an entrepreneur is an ability to run a business with successful strategy implementations and bringing profits to the organisation. It has become a dream for many individuals to run a business themselves instead of employing a company. There are considerable merits and some demerits of this decision, which will be discussed in this essay coming forth paragraphs. I will provide supporting reasons and examples to back up why advantages are higher than disadvantages. Ċ Owning a business first in place has two demerits to consider at a high level. It needs strategic planning in all perspectives of business like funding, operations, profitability and returns on investment to start a business, otherwise, might incur a large number of financial losses to the owner. It was evident that 28% of businesses newly emerged in the last two years are closed without running for more than a year as per the latest Indian economical statistics. Adding to this, it increases insurmountable stress on the founder of the organisation to withstand this competitive market, which is not in the case of an employee. This leads to major health problems like blood pressure and heart attacks at times. Ċ Keeping the drawbacks aside, there are two important benefits of being an entrepreneur in society. It gives greater visibility on the market needs, consequently, increases the decision making capability to arrive at the unique selling point for the organisation with the previous failure experiences that an individual has learnt. McDonald's founder, for instance, has failed 68 times in his life to get success finally at the age of 62. Exponential financial benefits can be assured if the invented idea has a uniqueness, which cannot be achieved by an employee in his lifetime. An out of box idea like establishing the simplest messaging platform, for example, Whatsapp has made Mark Zuckerburg one of the world's richest businessman. Ċ In conclusion, it's a dream for many individuals to run an organization rather than work under an employer. This has certain disadvantages, however, in the form of increased stress and incurring financial losses if it fails, but the merits of being a founder of a company with a vision to succeed and earning money outweighs the drawbacks."
10677,Many companies use advertisement to increase the sales. What are the main reasons that make an advertisement effective ? Is it positive or negative develkpment,"Advertisement has been a major factor for companies's incomes for a long time.There are two significant reasons that made the advertisement efficient, which are attraction and reputation. Ċ Firstly, the attraction, If an advertisement can attract people to be interested in companies' products or works, it would help them rise up their sales because as more people interest in companies' products or works they buy them or hire them more. For example, Apple, a well-known technology company, could raise their sales of iPhones, a smartphone product of Apple, because they made their display attractive and interesting. As the result, people went to their shop and buy iPhones. And that's why attractive advertisement is a reason which leads to the upturn of the companies' sales. Ċ Secondly, regarding with the reputation of advertisements, this reason is what follows the last reason mentioned, the attraction of the advertisement. This concern more on how advertisements spread across societies, the more popular advertisements are, the more people would acknowledge the products. For instance, The advertisements of the movies or what are called trailer, which advertise by posting on social media or appear on TVs, could make these movies more popular. Resulted in the increase of views and sales of movies when they are screened in the cinema. Thus, reputation of advertisements is another of the main reasons why advertisements are effective. Ċ In conclusion, The advertisements are effective because they attract people, and once the reputation of these advertisements has increased, The sales of companies would greatly go up."
10678,"In Britain, Many old age house are made nowadays. the expenses are paid by the governments. Who do you think should pay for this care, government or the family?","In the United Kingdom, nowadays old age houses are gaining popularity. Several times it is observed that old-aged people in these homes are looked after by the nurses, along with this, the expenses are borne by the government. In my opinion, these costs should be paid by the families rather than the authorities because those people's welfare is an undeniable responsibility of their family, and these expenditures are an extra toll on the government funds. Ċ To commence with, the family members are undoubtedly accountable for their older beings' expenses. It is a harsh reality that the older people are now forced to go to old age homes because earlier, they were the ones who nurtured their family. Hence, their children have the sole duty of paying their expenditure. For instance, if today's generation is not bothered about their previous generation, they should remember that their fate would not be dissimilar. Thus, it is imperative that family does this payment. Ċ Continuing with my secondary reason, these costs are an extra burden on the ministry. To elaborate more, if these charges are not paid by the families, authorities will have to pay those, and further there will be a minute decrease in the government treasury; consequently, it will affect a nation's economic development detrimentally. For example, in India, a railway project was postponed due to the lack of monetary funds which were allocated for building new old-age residences last year. Ċ In conclusion, the financial responsibility of looking after the old aging generation is absolutely on their families because they are their ancestors. Otherwise, the authority will have to come forward, which eventually will hamper the country's progress."
10679,Prompt: Many childhood experiences leave lifelong impressions on people. Write an essay in which you describe a memorable childhood experience and explain its effect on your life.,"Strong impressions and memories in childhood tend to affect a person's life. Fortunately, I have a great memory in my childhood that is giving positive influence to my life. I remember that I used to go to picnic every Saturday with my family. My parents like to go to small town village out side of city to the nature. Ċ When I was really young around five years old, we went to the park and mountain near by my house. My mother waked my brother and me up early in the morning to be prepared. We all wore same color of shirts and jeans although I felt it was embarrassed. I learned how to ride a bicycle from my father. He also taught me fishing, hiking and even riding a horse. Through the diverse experiences within the nature, I could feel comfortable and appreciated to the nature. Ċ In addition, when I was in teenager, my parents more likely to have family trip to different state instead of forcing me to study a home. While my father was driving, we had a great conversation in a car. Through the time, we could more understand each other. He brought our family to various places so I could wide my perspective of views towards the life. Ċ Although I was not aware of the precious moment at the time, now I can tell how it was important in my life. Through the time we were being together, I learned how family works together and help each other. Also, that is the reason why my parents are still my best friend who I can talk everything."
10680,"Learning would be improved through the extensive use of computers in the classroom. This would reduce the number of teachers required, which would be an advantage. Discuss. Can technology replace teachers?","Nowadays, with the immense advances of modern science and technology, computers are widely used in classrooms to improve the teaching and learning quality. This may lead to the decline in the number of teachers required. In my opinion, this phenomenon either brings about many benefits and maintains a number of drawbacks. Ċ First and foremost, most of computers in schools are now access to the high-speed Internet, which helps student approach a variety of learning materials around the world in different fields ranging from science or biology to geography or history. These materials can help students obtain general knowledge and increase level of cognitive achievement. Additionally, making use of computers will assist teachers in preparing for lessons and help them save much time and provide students with high-quality lectures. Ċ However, there are some disadvantages when utilising computers in classrooms. Firstly, schools equipped with modern technology hardly sidestep an issue of funding and financial resources. As a result, many schools in developing countries still remains traditional classes with poor-quality facilities and equipments. Secondly, human contact is of great importance so it is necessary for students to practice teamwork skills and communication skills. Finally, teachers play an integral part in evaluating student's progress and acknowledging their deficiencies. Ċ In summary, it is beneficial to use computers in classrooms; yet, teachers are still on demand and their roles are considered important."
10681,More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people say that increasing the price of fattening foods will solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is an increasing number of people who are getting severely obese in these modern days. It is believed that raising the price of foods that are high in fat is the solution for this issue. In my opinion, while this can be effective to a certain extent, there are other ultimate methods. Ċ On the one hand, the rise in high-fat foods’ costs may have some effects on the growing trend of the obese. First, the obese might hesitate about the eating expenditure. As a matter of fact, fast food which is high in fat is possibly the reason for this trend which is noticeably affordable. Meanwhile, vegetables or greens also have a modest price. Therefore, if fast foods’ payment is higher, people are likely to find other sources of diet that are within their means. Ċ On the other hand, there may be other remedies that can tackle this problem, such as education as awareness is the root of this matter. First, schools should be responsible for raising children’s awareness about health. For instance, biology, especially about how our bodies are affected by fat, can be focused more on the curriculum. As a result, children can understand the serious consequences of being obese and change their attitude towards fattening foods. Secondly, the government can launch campaigns about the health risks of being obese. As a matter of fact, adults tend to ignore their physical condition. This is because of the lack of knowledge about foreseen health negative effects that are resulted from a high-fat diet. Ċ In conclusion, I hold the view that raising high-fat foods is not as ultimate as raising awareness to cope with the rising trend of obesity."
10682,"Some people think that zoos are cruel and should be closed down. Others, however, believe that zoos can be useful in protecting wild animals. Discuss both views and give your opinions.","It is often argued that although wildlife parks safeguard the endangered species of animals, they are considered to be harmful and should be abolished. While it is significant to protect animals from being extinct, I believe that they should be living in their natural habitats. Ċ 	On the one hand, due to deforestation, evolution, and natural selection, many species of animals are at complete risk of disappearing from the earth. Thus, zoologists and professionals around the world are trying their best to keep the lineage of the endangered species to progress by constructing zoos, where they are conserved with utmost care. For example, pandas, the national treasures of China, would not be in existence without the efforts of scientists in the country. Ċ 	On the other hand, keeping the animals in captivity is inhumane and cruel for animals as they are caged in insufficient spaces to roam around. Moreover, most creatures are prone to starvation, various diseases, and distress at an increasing rate if isolated in the same place for many years. For instance, lions, which are regarded as the kings of jungles, become weak and depressed when they are chained between the iron bars. Hence, zoos are just a place for entertainment of people with the exchange of animals’ freedom and they should not be opened again forever. Ċ 	In conclusion, zoos are crucial for certain animals to continue their life through thorough research and methods; however, most species belong to their respective habitats instead of being preserved in a small area, which should be closed down."
10683,"Some say that when a person achieves success in their job, it means that he/she is selfish and doesn’t care about others. Do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that a person becomes self-centred after getting triumph in his career and this leads to making him irresponsible towards others. I strongly disagree with this notion and will discuss my arguments with various examples. Ċ To begin with, to be successful in life one has to do sacrifices. They should be determined, hardworking and focused towards their ambition. And, to achieve the goal, individual will only think about the ways to get there and in this phase sometimes they have stayed to away from family and friends. They have to go to universities which will enhance their skills and step ahead. Also, these places provide them with placements in big companies. For example, many students migrate to other countries to get better jobs and to make a better living for their own and for their family. They are working and helping their families back home financially. Ċ In Addition, one wants to be successful in his field, in order to help others. They want to have a status in the society. For instance – Ratan Tata an Indian Business Man, who is a very famous personality, runs many companies of his own. In order to provide employment to people, he has opened new companies in every sector like TATA Communications, transport, steel, textiles and so on. Also, recently he has donated a huge amount of his savings to Indian National Fund to help people in this pandemic situation. Ċ To sum up, I believe if a person wants to be successful he has to think for himself first and then only he can make his family stable and fulfil the needs. And in this process , one needs to do sacrifices and people think it is selfish."
10684,"School teaching should focus on success on the workforce and less attention should be given to academic achievement , to what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is a common belief that children should emphasize more in mechanical training and less on academic achievement. From my perspective, I, holistically, disagree with the viewpoint that students have to spend less time on theoretical knowledge for preparing themselves as factory workers. Ċ To begin with, the main reason that I believe academic successes are vital and act as a certificate to get a high paid occupation. In other words, if they study academic objectChange the noun formobjectsThe form of the noun object does not appear to be correct when used before the phrase such as. Consider changing the noun form. Ċ show examples like art, science, and commerce, it would provide a better job opportunity in the long run. Besides, a mechanical engineer would earn less amount of money, while doctors, engineers, and software programmers would gain a huge amount of salary. This, invariably, could help them to achieve name and fame, and eventually, they will be recognized as a better person in society. That is why school teachers must spend a long hour teaching their students academic topic. For instance, a student can cover mechanical subject matter within a short time and learns the ins and outs of that topic. On the contrary, they need to emphasize theory which requires more day. Ċ In addition, when students spend time concentrating on academic subjects, they can gain more in-depth knowledge about specific things, the contribution of such employees would be more productive owing to the fact that they have spent years gaining information about designated fields. Therefore, they are fruitful for the company they are working in because of the more prosper the organization would be.A survey suggested that people having more educational achievements do get an increased number of chances to succeed and they enjoy many privileges. Ċ In conclusion, I, diametrically, disagree with this statement. In fact , spending time on the academic syllabus brings more opportunity and worldly achievement in life."
10685,More developing countries are given aid from international organisations to help them in their development plans. Some people argue that financial aid is important but other suggest that practical aid and adive is more important ? Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion ?,"In the era of globalisation, efforts are being made to develop all the nations of the earth. To achieve this, internationally recognized organisations are lending hands in many ways to develop the developing nations. Arguments are been made about financial or practical aid and advice, which is better. I strongly believe that both are equally important. In this essay, both points will be discussed. Ċ To begin with, one of the most common methods used by various international institutes by providing finances with the development plans. Indeed to start any project, the capital required have a lot of emphases. Additionally, numerous plans are dropped because they do not fit in the allocated budget. For instance, the plan to build bullet trains in India has been reviewed several times, owing to the fact that they are not executable economically. Hence, financial service provided by the international agencies justifies their need. Ċ On the other hand, another way to fast track the development plans is by providing practical assistance and suggestions for the development plans by international organisations. Admittedly, they are the hidden yet important elements of a plan executed perfectly. Moreover, practical assistance can kickstart the development and guidance on delicate matters will elude the chances of failure. For example, the recent developments of metro rails in India which were closely monitored international experts are much more efficient than the one’s which were not. Therefore, practical assistance and guidance are extensively helpful. Ċ In summary, in my opinion, financial, as well as practical aid and advice,aid and advice are equally important. The aid should be given pragmatically so that the purpose is served and the desired outcome can be achieved. The aid should be considered thoughtfully so that it is utilised in a productive manner instead of taking it for granted."
10686,Some people say that too much attention and too many resources are given in the protection of wild animals and birds. Do you agree or disagree about this opinion?,"It is true that society pays too much attention and allocate too many resources to protect wild animals. In my opinion, I totally agree with this point of view. Ċ There are some reasons why I think that the protection of wild species has attracted great public attention. Firstly, many non-governmental organizations are established to protect animals over the world. However, they are too concerned about animal-related problems. For example, these institutions accused famous singers of using wildlife animals in their music videos for commercial purposes, while they did not. Secondly, news about animal-related problems can be spread widely on the Internet. For instance, if a polar bear is imprisoned someplace, this news will be shared rapidly through social networking sites such as Facebook, Telegram, and Twitter. Ċ In addition, people spend too much money on protecting animal species. The most important thing is that a great deal of money is required to carry out projects aiming to save the DNA of animals, which infrastructure and research are most expensive. Moreover, authorities have created many national parks and natural reserves, where rare species have the freedom to roam, exhibit their behaviours, and breed. Thus, this contributes to saving wildlife from extinction. Another thing is that governments should increase investment in key fields such as medicine, agriculture, and education. Additionally, they can allocate resources to improve the quality of life in some areas in the next years. Ċ In conclusion, I think that the public has spent too much concern and money protecting animal species in this modern world."
10687,"Most successful inventions do not rely on complicated technology. In fact, some of the world's greatest invention have been very simple things. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Cutting-edge advance on user-friendly technology application is effective to attract consumers. I strongly agree that simply design and invaluable feature have a significant impact in successful of a new product. Ċ There is no doubted that many new products accepted by the consumer because of simplifying the features Many high-tech companies compete to make the sophisticated design. Firstly, telephone manufacturing company such as Blackberry, Nokia and Siemens produced their cell phone with a keypad; however, Apple launched iPhone first generation with a minimalist design which has flat LCD and only a button, so the consumer was fond of this smartphone. This concept is breakthrough the handphone concept all the time; hence, others develop new gadget with less button and to standardize of the smartphone. Secondly, Camera Company invents mirror lens camera. This model is a combination of professional camera feature and compact camera design, so this camera has a professional features with less height and space on the bag that is easier to bring in some conditions. Many photographers, even professional, adore this new idea. So not only function is important but also the design has significant role as customer choice Ċ However, many products, which is popular now, was difficult operation before. For Instance, computer had a great size and plenty of buttons at first launched. Although the machine size was same as a desk and only can few function such only calculation, many big companies bought high price. Ċ In conclusion, I agree that The phenomenal invention is a combination of elegant design and easy to use tend to successful in the market. So companies innovate their product dramatically"
10688,"Topic:  Some people believe that the majority of news being reported is bad news such as wars, famines, accidents, and crime. Why do you think that is? Do you think the news should be a balance of both good and bad news?","Media Industry is always concerned by billion people over the world. Human lives have more developed, so the matters about knowing information have been more interested. Some people believe that the majority of news being reported is bad news such as wars, famines, accidents, and crime influencing badly on many people. Ċ Life is more convenient and modern, the most human depends on machines, the less human is active and sensitive. They are easy to fall in pressure and negative thinking. Moreover, they are willing to do the worst thing and leave the worst consequences. Newspapers and television usually give some negative news on media to announce people. So much hot news, so many people care and read. Ċ Most of the people like watching television, for both children and adults. They spend a lot of time watching television every day. Thus, if television has only programs about bad things, bad news such as wars, famines, accidents, and crime... that will create negative influences to both mentally and physically of viewers. News about accidents, criminals which are shown on TV in order to warn citizens that they have to be careful, to be safe. Besides, media producers should show more passive programmings like educational programs, health programs... These will bring a balance of both good and bad news which create better influences to viewers. For example, some programmings about building houses for homeless people, donating money for poor children, or some programmings about teaching languages should be shown on TV more usually. Ċ In brief, bad news totally does not bring the bad consequences. Of course, people should not use TV is a way to hide, so sometimes it can help us cope. The bad news and good news should be balanced, that will make life better."
10689,"All over the world, societies are facing a growing problem with obesity. This problem affects both children and adults. Ċ What are the reasons for this rise in obesity? How could it be tackled?","In recent times, obesity has increasingly grown in society. Across nations, we find that adolescents and grownups tend to be affected by this problem. This is because they lack discipline and self-control. With that in mind, creating time to exercise and eat healthily could be the way forward. Ċ First and foremost, some people find it difficult to stay challenged and focused on living healthy. This is because it is time-consuming for them to figure out ways to control their eating pattern since most of them cannot even encourage themselves to exercise . For example, when parents constantly buy fast-food for their kids without proper discipline on how the infants can burn the calories gained, it could lead to child obesity. Thus, causing them to lose their self-esteem as growing toddlers Ċ Being able to find a solution to the above issue stretches towards an individual's ability to exercise regularly. For instance, when a person spends some time in the gym, they tend to lose weight in major areas in their body. Also, eating clean and healthy can be added to their daily routine. This is because a child and adult cannot stay fit if they keep consuming unhealthy meals. Hence, good diets would help promote bowel movement in their body system Ċ In conclusion, in as much as they are an increase in weight gain in our society and a lot of families are unable to stay true to a routine that would help them avoid fatness, it is also extremely vital for parents to take into consideration what they eat and feed their kids because it could make or destroy their social interaction with other children."
10690,Some people feel that petrol cars should be banned. Others feel that we should be allowed to drive petrol cars. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"A lot of people believe that in order for us to stop global warming, we need to ban all products that have any form of carbon emission, which unfortunately petrol cars are one of those products. In this essay I will discuss why I don't think petrol cars should be banned. Ċ Yes, I agree that we need to fight global warming and make the earth greener, but we can't do this overnight. We need a more subtle approach to transition into electric cars. If we ban gasoline cars, this would cause a lot of hardship in the economy. For example, a logistics company that manages a fleet of vehicles would find it difficult to cope with such cruel regulation. This decision could even drive such company out of business for good. This would be catastrophic for families who relied on that business to make ends meet. Ċ On the other hand, if we ban gasoline cars we would be able to end carbon emission a lot faster than previously anticipated. Our cars would be more efficient and earth friendly. New opportunities would be created and the world would start leaning towards an alternative source of energy. Tesla for instance, is one of the leading manufacturer of electric cars. In their recent reports, they have been able to achieve a higher miles per gallon than any fuel or diesel car ever made. Ċ In conclusion, banning cars that uses fuel has a strong negative impact on the economy and also a positive effect on our environment. But in order for us to continue to function and not plunge into a great depression for the sake of making the earth green, we should create laws that would help us to slowly transition from this conventional car into electric ones instead."
10691,"The omnipresence of charities and governmental assistance packages leaves little room for self-reliance to survive adversity. In about 300 words, state whether you agree or disagree with this opinion and explain the reasons.","It is advocated that the ubiquity of charitable organizations and government support packages hampers individuals’ independence to survive hardship themselves. From my perspective, I voice disapproval of the aforementioned, believing that philanthropy has fostered great moral values as well as brought about intangible benefits far outweighing its seeming disadvantages. Ċ In the first place, such humanitarianism marks a praiseworthy feature of morality that, under any circumstances, cannot be dispensed with. In other words, by mostly reaching out to the incapacitated and the impoverished, charities and government assistance packages assure that no one is left behind in the whole community. Therefore, it would be irrational to question whether charitable work has deprived the disadvantaged of so-called self-reliance, since receiving support cannot be equated with being deeply dependent. For instance, in view of severe food, health crises and water scarcities, the indigent Africans are in desperate need of global aid, which could by no means be judged as a lack of self-sufficiency. This substantiates the claim that charitable contributions are a sheer manifestation of humanity and benevolence with which self-reliance has nothing to do. Ċ What is more, charitable work and public aids are aimed not so much at specifically helping the underprivileged as offering them the means to survive adversities themselves. That is, rather than take their place to tackle difficulties, those institutions only provide them with the needed mental and financial support so that they could work out ways to help themselves. For example, as regards the inadequate children living in underserved areas, volunteers do not hand them money or relocate them to other developing residential areas, but rather offer them education and equip them with the essential life skills. Assuredly, the children cannot transform their lives unless they make great efforts. Hence, not only does charity not leave little room for independence, contrariwise, such philanthropies help foster it. Ċ All things considered, it is undeniable the omnipresence of charities and government assistance packages have brought about innumerable benefits, be they moral or materialistic. Thus, I stand convinced that the given statement is rather one-sided, claiming that humanitarianism is here to stay."
10692,People born today can expect to live longer than people in previous generations. What are some of the positive and negative implications of this phenomenon? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays, due to effective health care system and advancement in medicines. It tends to believe that an individual born in this era having a possibility to leave for long time compare to earlier people. I will discuss some of the benefits and drawbacks of such circumstance. Ċ Firstly, no dough that older people are experienced and well versed wisdom. Since they have seen so many changes in throughout the life they know who to tackle the situation if the needs arises. Secondly, they are the guards of each family, like a pillar they keep all the family members connected. For example, in my country, whatever decision are made they are consulted by the elders of the family and with their guidance and advise the steps are taken especially for marriages. Finally, they preserve the culture and keeping on the forwarding importance of it from one generation to another, which is essential for everyone to know their traditions. Ċ On the other hand, the demerits of such a prodigy is that the older the people more their dependence increases. Furthermore, olds are prone to diseases which is why over a period of time human body is unable to fight against adverse effects of any illness. Additional they become burdens on the family, since they are not in a position to do any work by themselves. For instance, the reason behind the old age homes are successful these days is because on average 88% of grandparents becomes an extra burden on the family. Therefore, it is ease to just keep them in the old homes. Ċ To conclude, fascinating to live a long life, but it also has some consequences like being loaded onSuggestionwith family, no energy for flighting with diseases. However, they teach a conducive lesson in life because of hands on knowledge they have."
10693,"generosity between nations. Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such..... You should write at least 250 words. Use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and with relevant evidence.","The situation of world nations is different, some countries developed while most of them are poor, although they have the same resource. The wealthy nations, however, utilized their resources efficiency. They characterize law unemployment, higher saving, agricultural improvement and higher level of education, its vice versa to the poor nations. In spite there is a food security in the world, the least developed nations are the most ones, further illiteracy is high. Ċ Therefore, on the one hand, it's the responsibility of the government of poor nations to invest their education and cultivate their farms to get food. One other hand, in my view as there a high saving in the wealth nations, they afford to support the poor nations, to eliminate the illiteracy in the word and to get a sufficient food, it would be very good to support. Ċ The aid can be through the world organizations, particularly the UN agencies or any other international agency. This will lead to encourage the hospitality among nations. Helping and supporting each other in the difficult times will make the world best, because a friend indeed is a friend need. Ċ This support from the wealth nations to the poor nations, whether its food or education or any other support will likely to lower the number of immigrants flee from their countries to seek food, shelter and education. Ċ Finally I encourage the governments of poor nations to stop the corruption, allocate their resources efficiency, unlike their counter part of wealthy nations. One time in the future, they may be those giving the Aid."
10694,"Some people believe that to become successful at a sport requires a natural ability, others think that hardwork and practice are more important. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion","Mainly, to become a successful individual in a fun field may be required various abilities including natural abilities and more practice relying on one's belief. In my opinion, it seems to me that more training is more essential rather than an innate skill. This essay will discuss both innate and hardworking abilities with my perspectives. Ċ In general, a large number of individuals are likely to be different in types of sports activities, depending on their personal favourite and body. It is obvious that each individual figure is differently suitable for each type of sport. The better carcass you have, the better performance you get. For example, people who are tall and flexible are appropriate for games applying with quick movement such as volleyball. Whereas, people who are small and outweigh are disadvantages of playing. Ċ However, the innate figure could not be changed totally over the years. More repeat with enough time in those fields is able to benefit to one’s individuals. In the same athletics mentioned above, the individual who outweighs could lose their weight first to be more flexible in the real field. In addition, one will become professional during many year periods with enough exercise. A suitable form with less exercise will be less professional comparing to one who is much trained and continuous. For instance, a swimmer taking time over twenty hours a week is likely to be more potential than people with just ten hours a week of training. Ċ To conclude, having an innate suitable carcass is just like a gift supporting your activities. On the other hand, more hard-working and practice are considerably impacted to improve one’s game skills. I believe that many who take more performing with the strong aspiration also are good at those fields."
10695,"THE 50'S FAMILY AND TODAY'S Topic: With the number of divorce rates skyrocketing recently, it is commonly believed that families are not as close as they were fifty years ago.  Discuss the causes of this problem and offer some possible solutions to it.","These days, it seems that more and more couples are divorcing than fifty years ago. This raises certain uncertainty about the issue of the relationship of couple. In this essay, i will plan to discuss the reason of the issue and also offer some viable solution to it. Ċ In the past, men assumed to be the one who needed to earn money from work, while women were supposed to stay at home and to look after children. In recent times, however, the cost of living has become much more expansive than ever before, it requiring both of the parents to go to work for the money, therefore, the stress on them has become unbearable. The more argue between couples, the more number of divorce rates increased. Ċ In order to solve the problem, i believe that we must first address its root causes. Perhaps the most effective method to solve this problem would be to help from the government. The government would provides some allowance to certain families. For example, the government could provides particular allowance depending on how many children the family needs to take care of. Ċ Although the problem is by no means insurmountable, it is unlikely that it will be solved in the foreseeable future. However, i believe that the solution outlined above would constitute a good first step."
10696,do you agree or disagree with the following statement. In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today,"Nowadays, some individuals opine that the number of private transportations, especially cars, would drop in the next twenty years compared to the current century. Personally, I totally disagree with this statement as there are various reasons behind this and I will elaborate in the following essay. Ċ Regarding the reasons why I believe so, In the near future, the car industry would be developed in various ways in order to improve the amenities of life while using this. Additionally, Technology will play a crucial role in transportation developments, which provides a number of benefits to car users, leading to a significant increase in individuals who commonly utilise cars for working and travelling. I suppose those prices would be reasonable and affordable, leading accessibility in a wide range of people in several countries. For example, the transport will be cheaper than the current period as technology allows companies to reduce manufacturing costs. Ċ Furthermore, Petrol, which is the main resource for driving, would be unused as entire up-to-date technological transports are prone to use electricity instead of those recourses, which allows individuals to save their money and are less concerned about the rising of petrol prices. For instance, Teslar users in Thailand are no more concerned about an increase in fuel costs in inflation anymore. In addition, people tend to gain an awareness of environmental issues such as air pollution, which was mainly emitted by vehicles that rely on fuel. Thus avoiding those type of vehicles assist the world from dreadful consequences. Ċ In conclusion, Technology would involve in many car industries in order to comfort consumers and prevent environmental issues, leading to an increase in the number of private transport utilisers."
10697,"Some people support the idea of imposing taxes on fossil fuels (oil, coil and gas) in order to reduce energy consumption. Other people disagree with this approach. Consider the debate and its arguments, and come to your own conclusion.","Humankind is heavily dependent on the natural resources in their day-to-day life. Fossil fuels are one of the most highly consumed resources. It is argued by many that, government should introduce taxation of the use of such resources while many others oppose this argument. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and draw a conclusion. Ċ Assuming that the taxes are not imposed, the use of petrol, diesel and other fossil fuels will continue and burgeon with the increase in population. This may lead to the resources being exhausted completely. To illustrate, an article published in the Times now magazine states that, if the consumption of petrol in motor vehicle continue at the same rate, there will be no petrol by the year 2100. Subsequently, this argument has unfavourable outcomes. Ċ However, on the other hand, if the counterpart argument about laying taxation is considered. The society may see the surge in usage of fossil fuel, but will also affect the motor vehicle sector immensely, which in return will reflect on the economic growth of the country. Thus, this might be a suitable option but, is not the solution to the problem in the long run. In addition to this argument, the government should use the taxes collected to fund its research and development department to develop a cost effective hybrid vehicle which can meet the need of the modern lifestyle, and as well, reduce the consumption of the such natural resources. Ċ To conclude, the argument to oppose imposing taxes has no base to it. Whilst by application of fuel taxes, and putting it to better use of providing solution to such crises will be of significant good for humankind."
10698,Television dominates the free-time of too many people. It can make people lazy and prevent them from socializing with others. Ċ Do you agree or disagree?,"One of the most conspicuous trends in today's world is television. Some people believe that television is stopping people from socializing with fellow neighbours. On the other hand, others argue that television can connect people with the virtual world through interactive programs. As such, there are both merits and demerits for this trend. In my view, I strongly agree that watching television is killing our leisure time and it leads to laziness. Ċ Firstly, watching television can cut ourselves from the rest of the world. Many people are watching television programs and becoming fat by avoiding daily exercise routine. However, teenagers are affected by this activity and parents are worried about their declining social skills. For instance, a recent survey reported that most high school students' are no longer interested in playing outdoor games in the evening and wish to watch television all day. Needless to say, watching television can affect our lifestyle and communication skills. Ċ Secondly, a possible solution for this trend is to allocate time for every aspect of life and try to socialize with neighbours. Moreover, over watching television can lead to poor eye vision and most people are suffering from poor vision. For example, researchers suggested that kids are having poor vision because of television watching. Hence, people should reassess their daily routine and try to socialize with neighbours to enhance their communication skills. Ċ In conclusion, change is the essence of nature and people have to choose between the available options and improve their lifestyle by less watching television and more time with friends and family for a better life. Finally, the negative impacts of television are too dire to ignore."
10699,Some people believe that there is a reduction in air travel in the future.Do you think that this trend as positive or negative development?,"A section of society often argued that there will be a downfall in commuting through the air in the future. I firmly believe that this will be a negative transformation due to two main reasons. Firstly, this evolution will decrease the profits of airlines companies. Secondly, it will affect the economy of the countries. This essay will intend to strengthen my belief in detail with relevant examples. Ċ First of all, if people will not travel by aeroplanes then, air companies will suffer from huge financial losses. This is primarily because these agencies invest mammoth money in various assignments such as purchasing new aeroplanes, handsome salaries to working staff-members, and excellent services to travelling customers. Therefore, due to fewer masses travelling, these organizations will receive significant money losses. For example, Due to COVID-19 pandemic, these agencies have suffered from billions of dollars losses due to lockdown all around the world. Ċ Secondly, this transformations will affect the economy of the nations. In other words, the maximum populace will skip their sightseer journey due to low availability of flights options. As a consequence, host nations will sacrifice their money earning from tourist visits which will impact negatively on the financial resources of the concerned countries. For instance, Indonesia country receives a huge amount of funds from traveller visits. If they will not come to this province then their economy will fall down completely. Hence in order to maintain a strong fund, tourist movements should not be affected. Ċ In conclusion, some experts proposed that in future days there will be a downfall in the populace movement through the air. I strongly believe that this will be a negative transformation because not only this evolution will decrease the profits of airlines companies but also it will affect financially to the countries."
10700,"Some believe that educational success is based on good teachers, while others believe that it depends upon the student’s attitude. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","These days, the discussion of careers development is on the rise. While many people believe that educational success depends on having good tutors, others claim that a student's attitude is what is all about. I believe that in most cases, being instructed by a brilliant teacher is the basis to succeed in the educational field. Ċ Firstly, a good teacher may serve as a source of inspiration and motivation. Most of the times, a well-prepared teacher designs tailor-made lessons that keep students engage along with the desire to be continuously learning in order to be one day, as the teacher is. For instance, recently conducted research showed that the more empathetic and educated the teacher is, the more the students will succeed in their grades. That is to say, there is a strong correlation between teacher quality and the achievement of the student's goals. Ċ On the other hand, the student's attitude might not be enough. Even students that are willing to study over time, need guidance from instructors in order to effectively learn the needed concepts of the course. Even though nowadays we have a variety of sources where to find information, there is nothing more valuable than an explanation and guidance from an excellent professor. For example, the fact that there is an abundance of content on the internet and different opinions are being posted with no limits can cause a great deal of confusion to the student. Unless the student's commitment is not supported by a professional, this would make very little to further their careers. Ċ Finally, despite many claims and assumptions about self-preparation in the educational field, I would never underestimate the crucial role that teachers play in student's life."
10701,"In certain cultures old age is considered to be more important while in others it's the opposite, children are thought to be more important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Old age and children are both filled with happiness. Some people believe that older age is significant while others think that children are more crucial stage in a life period. In this essay, I will explain both the views in detail. Ċ Undeniably, older people are experience, matured, intelligent, in all the aspects of life. They show path to youngsters. They play major role in family decision. For example, in India elders are imperious decision authority in a family, they are important factor in all the actions in the family. Moreover, they have imperative qualities such as good morals and ethics, truthfulness, sincerity and respect and inheriting such quality to the young people. They can tackle any problems with their profound knowledge and wisdom. Ċ On the other side of the coin, children are energetic, smart, optimistic, enthusiastic, dedicative to their goals and future of our world. Their activities always are fun and grasp abstract concepts and apply logic in various scenarios. They need appreciation, availability and acceptance from others and extra-ordinary care from parents. Government supports free education for children as they are the prospect citizens. Youngsters are assertive, innovative, updated with technological skills. They are buttress to the society. Ċ To conclude, by analyzing both the view, in my opinion older and younger age are valuable to the society. They contribute most of the happiness, love, affection, compassion to the society. It is difficult to differentiate old and young age both play vital role in the community."
10702,"Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?","Numerous characters deem memories from childhood, especially kindergarten memories, affects our future life; in contrast, certain groups of people oppose and affirm the future depends on the experiences from person's adolescence. From my perspective, I assume childhood memories form our habitual behaviour, while we gain knowledge and abilities. Ċ On the one hand, it is an inevitable fact that we learn all skill and knowledge during the age of 13-19 and based on you what you learnt, your achievement and way of living form, which is why psychologists ask adolescence age before giving counsellings. Besides, every adult usually retrospects their young age-(13-19). For example, if we ask from a random man, do you remember your childhood? The man says not really, while the man vividly remembers his teenage age. Thus, memories of kindergartens do not affect adult life, since we do not even recall that period. Ċ On the other hand, people putting importance on childhood are overlooking the fact that we do not gain enough information and develop ingenuity. If we recall our kindergarten age, we will realise we only learnt some basic skills. For instance, Rayleigh, a well-known psychologist from the USA, said in my view, I presume it is a futile method to probe my clients' childhood to treat the disorder. Hence, it is an undeniable fact that we learn to communicate, dress, eat, and other primary skills in our early life. Ċ In conclusion, from the arguments and examples given, I firmly believe the idea that tender age is the root of our future, and people rejecting it will waste time and money."
10703,Consumer goods have become the most important part of people’s lives. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Consumer goods have become the mainstay of people’s living.  This essay is an attempt to study the merits and demerits and provide a conclusion. Ċ In today’s fast paced world, consumer goods are a boon to humanity.  Firstly, they are available in all categories ranging from automobiles, furniture, household appliances etc.  While they make life easy and comfortable, they do not cost an arm and a leg and are generally affordable.  For instance, one can cook up a pre cooked meal to satisfy hunger or reach any far off place in no time by taking a vehicle or perform all household chores such as laundry, dish cleaning, sweeping and mopping at the click of a button of the washing machine, dish cleaner, and vacuum cleaner respectively.  Hence, this definitely leaves some room for an individual to pursue their hobbies or passions, which leads to better living standards. Ċ However, consumer goods have their drawbacks as well.   This results in obesity and other ailments such as cardiac problems, diabetes, joint aches, respiratory issues etc. For example, a recent study carried out in the U.S has shown that excessive use of smart devices can cause neural disorders in people as they emit harmful radio waves. Moreover, excessive usage of automobiles is fast depleting our natural resources such as petrol, diesel and adding to the existing pollution levels. Ċ  In conclusion, it would be prudent to say that while consumer goods still continue to be a boon to mankind, its usage should be regulated and monitored on an individual and government level to ensure it continues to be a boon and not a bane."
10704,"Some cities have vehicle free-days where private cars, trucks and motorcycles are banned in city centres. Only bus, bicycles and taxis are permitted in the city centres. Do you think the benefits outweigh the disadvantages? PUBLIC VEHICLES only IN CITY CENTRES","There are some places that public vehicles are allowed to pass and there are also that forbid private cars on certain days. This kind of strategy to all transportations are being implemented in most cities. I think this has more pros than cons that I will explain further. Ċ In this ban, people with cars and companies that use trucks in exchange of goods are at disadvantaged. Their products can be delayed while business men who travel with their own cars are not allowed to use them. Thus, it creates a hassle to figure out a different way or transportation to go from one place to another. Ċ However, there are more advantages than drawbacks. First, it reduces car congestion in city centres. Trucks are huge, and buses, are the same too. Dividing the days that these large vehicles can travel will give more space to other vehicles. As a result, traffic jams or any car accidents will decrease. Ċ As an example, In the Philippines, their President implemented a window period that allows trucks and other heavy container cars in using city roads. There are only certain areas that they can enter. Thus, minimizing traffic and providing more room to other cars. They also have a system that controls the number of vehicles on the road. The last number of every car plate has an indication that there are specific days that people can not use their cars and they call it 'coding'. Ċ Therefore, I believe that there are more benefits for letting the public transportations including bicycles in city centres as presented in this essay. Giving private ones, like cars, trucks and motorcycles, a rest to the road is an advantage to the city and public."
10705,Many people living in cities these days do not get enough physical exercise. Ċ What are the causes of this? Ċ What are some possible solutions?,"It is evident that city dwellers are more likely to suffer from chronic and non-communicable diseases due to the absence of physical activity. The majority of people who are living in the cities have rarely seen working out their bodies. This essay will discuss the reasons and solutions to this issue. Ċ One of the main reasons that prevent people from exercising regularly, they have been accustomed to living a sedentary lifestyle . This lifestyle has arisen because of modern technology, which encourages individuals to become more dependable on this technology to perform all of their daily tasks. Nowadays, they spend most of their at home watching movies on Netflix instead of going outside with their friends. Also, they can run their errands through popular online applications such as ordering food or purchasing grocery items. Technology is the root of propelling people toward a passive lifestyle. Another important cause to this case, employees are prisoners of their work as they could not be able to find time for moving or stretching their bodies. When a regular worker works for an average of ten hours per day , it is definitely exhausting for him to train vigorously his body. Ċ The solution to this trend requires a contribution of both the government and the citizens. First, the government have to increase the numbers of sports facilities and it is advisable to be free of charge to stimulate people to take care of their well-being. For example , the Abu Dhabi government builds up outdoor activities in each block of the city and offer free scooters and bicycles that are located on each road. As a result , more and more residents are going out to enjoy these outdoor facilities. Secondly, Individuals hold the key to changing their daily habits by stopping or eliminating all the addictive habits that distract them from exercising. They aware of the benefits of physical activity, but they are more likely to find an excuse for not training physically. Ċ To sum up, it can be seen that sedentary lifestyle and the responsibilities of jobs have made it more difficult for residents of cities to do their workouts. However, the government and individuals play a vital role in tackling this issue."
10706,People are less fit and active nowadays than in the past. What are the reasons for this? What measures can be taken to fix this? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience,"People are more inactive and unfit currently than people who lived in the past. The reasons and solutions to fix this issue are explained further below. Ċ The primary reason for this is the excessive consumption of fast food. For example, most school children nowadays are much obese than those of the previous generation due to their current love for pizzas.Additionally, the current generation of youngsters is heavily relying on comfortable air-conditioned personal cars for the purpose of travel instead of walking or cycling to the desired destination.Therefore, the scope of the body to burn fat has become very limited. Hence, due to increased intake of fat and reduced options to burn it, people have become more unfit and inactive than their ancestors. Ċ However, there are simple remedies in place to fix the problems of an inactive lifestyle. Firstly, everyone should stop eating fast foods. Secondly, youngsters should focus more on ways to shed the fat present in their body such as exercising in the gym or walking to the office or school.Thus, when such activities are coupled with the attitude of avoiding junk meals, the current generation can become more active and fit. Ċ In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that the present generation of humans is less fit and inactive than their ancestors due to their preferences like immense intake of junk meal and alcohol as well as travel to work or school in personal cars. The solutions to fix the issues that arise from this situation are avoiding the consumption of high calories and spending a lot of energy in places like the gym or sports centre."
10707,"Schools offer a wide range of courses such as physical education, music, economics, philosophy, math, English，geography, physics and history. Among all these subjects, which one do you think is the most important and which one is the least important?","Nowadays, along with the emphasis on the overall development of individuals, students now stay at schools also enjoy a variety of cultural courses. The courses provided with them vary from basic language courses such as english, chinese, french, to natural science and social science. Among so many branches, it is really hard to say which is the most important one and which is not, Personally, I think the basic language education occupies the most vital position, while all the other locate in the second important place. Ċ The reason why I believe the basic language is important is based on the following reasons: First of all, basic language is the bridge of communication, if a person can master his/her native language well, he/she will become lonely and isolated, which probably lead to mental and psychological problem. Secondly, basic language is also the tool to enter into the new knowledge space. As almost all others are spread by words, it will be a barrier if him/her is unable to comprehend what meaning the words are describing and sending. Ċ In terms of the most unimportant one, I do not believe any one could be classified into this type. To my knowledge, all the others play an important role in the evolvement process of human being, mathematics enable us to calculate precisely; music and painting make it possible to express our inner feelings; physics and chemistry help us step into the industry age. Lack of any one of them, human being would not step into today. Ċ In conclusion, I personally think the basic language education is the most important one, as they are the underground stone of human development, while all the other disciplines place on the second important place, and there is not existing the least important one."
10708,Sales companies should recruit people who are hungry for money as they will make the most dedicated workers. Ċ Do you think money is the driving force behind hard work?,"Due to globalisation, businesses today face tough competition, which has made it essential for the companies to hire workers who are loyal and dedicated. Some people believe that individuals who are suffering from financial constraints, should be hired, especially by sales firms, as they would would work harder in order to earn money. In my viewpoint, money can be a motivating factor to some extent, however certainAccept comma additionhowever, certain other elements play a key role as well. This essay will augment my opinion. Ċ Firstly, salary is essential for fulfilling basic necessities of life, like food, clothing, shelter and education. Most people prefer choosing jobs that provide wages that would allow them to afford these needs and also, provide a comfortable life. If a person earns less, he/she will put in extra efforts and stay focused in order to gain a raise or a promotion, which can benefit the company. To cite an example, a salesman whose revenue depends on the number of sales he makes, will try every feasible method, to convince the customer to buy the item. Hence, it can be said that money is the motivating force behind perseverance. Ċ On the other hand, job satisfaction and passion are equally required for an employee to stay motivated and loyal. A person who enjoys his job is more likely to go above and beyond to finish the assignments, in comparison to someone who doesn't. Additionally, passionate associates, make an effort to achieve the satisfaction and perfection, and therefore are loyal toward their projects and put in their best. Moreover, the sense of fulfilment that the professionals get from their work, keeps them energised. To illustrate it, having good co-workers, understanding managers, and feeling appreciated are all the components of job satisfaction, which increases their efficiency and in turn boosts the organisation's profits. Ċ To conclude, salary is one of the impelling causes of hard work. But, in my view, many other factors such as passion, contentment and good working conditions, are vitally important to keep the employees energetic and faithful towards their projects."
10709,"Sports which are violent, such as boxing and wrestling have no place in a civilised society and should be banned. Do you agree or disagree ?","The controversial issue concerning the consequences of violent sports has attracted huge public attention and sparked a heated debate. Some people hold the view that boxing and wrestling have negative impacts on the younger generation and thus should be banned, while others argue in contrast to that. This essay tends to discuss the advantages of these competitions and I will explain why I disagree with the former statement. Ċ Firstly, it is unjustifiable to blame violence in sports for the prevalence of aggression in youth. Because aggression is innate to human beings, we received it from our ancestors who had to endure adverse conditions to survive. Aggressiveness was always present within us, the difference being that it is dormant in some while the rest have already triggered the gene due to environmental factors like fighting competition. However, wrestling alone does not promote cruelty. Action films and video games show violent content which contributes to building aggressive behaviour in people. Therefore, there's no point in banning these games as it will do nothing but snatch away the bread of those folk who make a living out of it. Every year people from impoverished families participate in boxing matches to earn money to support their families. Ċ Secondly, wrestling is a strenuous physical activity. Consequently, it helps in maintaining a fit body. For instance, many reports have shown that fighters and boxers are rarely affected by heart diseases. Moreover, it is effective for real-life self-defence situations. Due to these reasons, it is unjust to prohibit fighting games. Ċ To conclude, there are some drawbacks of these physical activities but these reasons are not enough to take legal actions against them. Hence, I disagree with the idea of restricting these activities."
10710,"best learning method for students TOPIC: Some teachers say students should be organized into groups to study, while others argue that students should be made to study alone. Tell the benefits of each study method. Which do you think is more effective?","People always have different views about what is the best learning method for students. Although there are those who may argue that students should study by themselves, I hold the belief that putting students into groups is the superior learning way. Ċ From my perspective, the first and foremost reason why people think studying alone is the best way is that students can be more independent than others. Self-study students normally have abilities to deal with all difficulties themselves instead of asking for help from teachers or peers. In other words, students would be capable of addressing academic problems independently which is considered as a benefit in today's society. Ċ However, from my point of view, I believe students should be organized into groups in order to study effectively and efficiently. Admittedly, schools or universities are like a small society, each person in this society could learn various essential skills such as how to be an excellent leader or they can sharpen their communication skills. In my personal experience, when students are put into small groups, we have to learn how to express our ideas in a well-mannered way and accept others' opinions politely at the same time. As a result, students would grow mentally and physically and become more mature during the discussion. Besides, collaboration is another principal factor why students should study with others with diverse backgrounds and personalities, we may learn how to be a good team player and realize the importance of cooperation. If students lack these experiences, it would be difficult for them to be a well-rounded person. Ċ In conclusion, it is obvious that studying in groups is much more beneficial to students than studying alone; therefore, I am convinced that studying with others is a more effective option."
10711,"There are many towns and cities designed and constructed in previous centuries, and they are suitable for those times What problem is caused by this today? How to solve this problem?","Old towns and cities built hundreds of years ago are still a feature of numerous countries and they can prove awkward for city planners. However, there are some measures that can and could be taken to improve this situation. Ċ A major problem related to this situation is that the development of old cities to suit modern needs is hampered to a large extent in two major ways, for example, they were designed for a smaller local population with very narrow roads and tightly compact buildings hampering mobility for the modern-day residents. This results in failing to provide people living there with more amenities as their modern counterparts do. For instance, it is difficult to construct some buildings like shopping malls, underground parking lots, office buildings and sports facilities, which are all an integral part of people's lives today.   Moreover, there is also the need for more housing as the population in these places increases. Ċ Since the problem has no single solution, it must be fought on many fronts. To begin with, some buildings can be demolished so as to construct new buildings to make the most of the limited space. More high-rise apartment buildings, for example, can be built to satisfy the needs for housing and improve the poor housing condition at the same time. In addition, historic buildings can be restored on account of their commercial and cultural value. Therefore, the government can use this to facilitate economic growth through tourism, thereby providing more income for urban development and urban planning. Ċ In conclusion, more time and energy should be invested in working out the solution by using a variety of approaches in order to make both residents and local governments benefit from this situation."
10712,"Topic: Currently more and more people respect elders and become convinced that older people should live with their families, which is in contrast to the view that older people should live at a nursing home. What is your opinion?","Some people claim that elderly care should be provided by nursing homes these days. In my opinion, senior citizens are advised to live with their descendants by dint of their needs of emotional support as well as the responsibility of younger family members. Ċ To begin with, one reason for the elders to stay with their families is that they are likely to suffer loneliness if they reside at nursing homes. While nursing homes are capable of supplying a variety of professional service, they fail to provide a sense of community for their residents. In fact, senior people have to integrate into an alienated environment unlike their formerly surrounding. Besides, various people struggle to establish friendships with their roommates due to characteristic differences. Coupled with living away from their family members and friends, it seems that their loneliness is potentially fostered. Ċ Additionally, it should be noted that younger members of the family are suggested to take responsibility for their elders. Elderly people used to experience a hard time of raising their children and grandchildren. Furthermore, they were responsible for teaching initial lessons for their descendants such as how to speak and how to behave. By taking care of the elders, in turn, can the young generations express their respect and gratitude towards their seniors. In most Asian countries, looking after the elderly people is regarded as an obligatory duty of individuals. That is to say, from a moral perspective, it is essential that older adults should stay with their families. Ċ To sum up, I would have to reiterate the necessity of the elderly people living with their family members. Not only do they feel a sense of interaction but also their descendants will have an opportunity to show their filial piety."
10713,"the ""gap year"" essay Some people believe that a gap year between school and university is a good idea, while others disagree strongly. Consider both sides of this debate and present your own opinion.","Most people believe that taking a year off between school and college is a top-notch decision, while others put it as the conversial one. The two sights are going to be discussed and I will consider through my opinion. Ċ Society assume that gap year is slightly pricy as students probably spend their whole time to travel and not preparing for the college test. They tend to waste their time hopefully to get a self discovery through exploring some places, but in the fact, it seems it does not effectively effect to their self improvement. Finally, they do not have much time to sit in college test and their intention to go to the college as they wish is absolutely gone. Ċ Conversely, gap year enthusiasts think that this helps them to consider which major suits their needs or passion. For example, a gap year taker will be flexible to attend many seminars regarding future plan in hope they will build a clear goal, at least for their own life. If they do it properly, they will particularly success in both university and job field. Thus gap year benefits them in the tunnel to figure out how they may set their future life. Ċ Overall, I suppose that a year off process brings its positivity in which it outweighs the bad impact to society. It can be concluded that taking gap year will securely protect them from misleading major as the future demands them to be success in both academic and real hands-on practical process."
10714,"Recent years, the number of crimes committed by young people in major cities throughout the world is increasing. Discuss this issue. Give reasons and suggest some solutions.","Recent years have seen the rise of juvenile delinquency in major cities around the globe, which has aroused people's concern. Ċ On possible cause worth mentioning is that the adolescents are more exposed to the media, which contain excessive violence information, and hence pose negative impact on the adolescents. For the adolescents, it is hard to tell right from wrong by themselves in that age. Consequently, receiving excessive violence information may tempt them to imitate like that, perhaps just for fun. Besides, the Incompleteness of the Roles that parents should play as supervisors may play a factor in this issue. Nowadays, since parents are spending most of their time on their job, they overlook their children's education and development, resulting in the adolescents taking on the wrong track. Additionally, the increasing number of the young adults committing crimes in major cities is due to the enormous temptation in the cities. It is universally acknowledged that everyone wants to pursue fame and fortune. As the city is the hotbed for lust and temptation, it is likely that the teenagers fail to resist their carving for fortune and attempt to obtain them in a wrong way. Ċ Considering the critical situations, carefully considered approaches are needed and higher priority must be given to. To begin with, domestic education ought to function properly, that is, parents had better keep their children out of trouble or help them out of it if they become involved. Meanwhile, the mass media might consider broadcasting violence-free programs for the adolescents. Moreover, the school should become actively involved in preventing its youth crime. Ċ Young people often dislike and resent the adult world. They will do things to show that they are rebels."
10715,Some people think that getting a degree from university is the best way to secure a good job. Others believe that employers value work experience more than a university degree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"At some point in their lives, people will face the challenge of deciding how to get their dream job. Even though some hiring managers look for specific higher education grades, others consider that hands-on experience is more valuable than a bachelor degree. In my opinion, the best way to secure a job will depend on the nature of the role. Ċ Some employers advertise roles for individuals that have studied in a specific field. For example, Hospitals or Dental clinics will look for health care professionals that have studied medicine or odontology, this is because the industry requires specific medical knowledge to treat patients. Another example, a manufacturing facility will require engineers to control their complex processes at the construction site. In both examples, the nature of the work is specific and entail specialised training, therefore tertiary education is needed to fulfil the requirements of the job. Ċ However, not every role require a highly specialised degree. For some occupations, having practical experience is more attractive for employers than getting a university degree diploma. For instance, office managers, shop managers, salespersons, not necessarily require a university grade to accomplish the desired results, moreover, skills like conflict resolution, active listening and people management will indeed make the applicant succeed in the role. Ċ In conclusion, some jobs require higher education degrees, since specialised knowledge is needed to perform the duties, others value more the work experience that an employee can bring to the company. Personally, I believe that the best way to secure a good career will depend on what kind of activity we want to do."
10716,type: argumentative essay (choose 1of3) topic: how should we file the complaint is most effective? portions: 1. in person 2. over the phone 3. by e-mail methods of writing an official complain,"With the advanced technology, many products have been invented to resolve dilemmas in our daily lives. The transaction, as an example, frequently exists some problems. If I had to complain to the seller about the detective items, I would do it over the phone. My reasons for taking a stance regarding to the issue will be expounded in the following paragraphs. Ċ In communication, humanizing the social formality, the wisdom assembled by all the people in the world has been in favor of closing the interpersonal distance. Thus, the phone was born, which has also derived some sorts of the phone for the past years such as cellphone, smartphone and so on. Otherwise, they can not only be used anytime and anywhere, but not be influenced by the inclement weather. In contrast, if you intend to complain to the seller in person, you might either waste much time for taking the vehicle and sticking in traffic jam or encounter the ineluctable accident. Ċ Irrefutably, e-mail has the same advantage of the phone, but it couldn't let the communication be got on with at that time. Once one of the parties is offline, and the other party has to wait for the response for a long time until the next time who receives the e-mail. Nevertheless, complaining over the phone doesn't exist the drawback stated above and it can even imply the tone to make the conversation more vivacious. Sometimes it would facilitate the benign development of complaint, instead of misunderstanding the meaning resulted from the description in e-mail. Ċ Based on these above reasons, I consider complaining over the phone more efficient to expound on the complaint than by e-mail and in person."
10717,"Some people think that zoos are cruel and should be closed down. Others, however, believe that zoos can be useful in protecting wild animals. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Wild animals should spend their entire life in a sanctuary that is much farther away from civilization. Few citizens think that a zoo is a dangerous location for any animal so it must be closed down whereas others believe that it is useful for safeguarding wild animals. In this essay, I will look at both sides of the argument and give my opinion. Ċ To begin with, zoos are a great place to keep species from getting extinct. Moreover, young children can visit this place to see various kinds of wild animals which are intricated to see in the jungle. For instance, if an animal suffers from a disease it would be very easy to provide him with proper treatment and he may recover quickly rather than dying in the jungle with no aid. Therefore, zoos are a safe place for all creatures. Ċ On the contrary, authorities are only interested in zoos because it has enhanced their economy. Furthermore, there are lots of restrictions applied to the animals, because they can't roam freely and enjoy their life. For example, these zookeepers pretend to treat this creature in an appropriate way when the citizens arrive but after the place is empty, opposite behaviour is visible. Hence, sanctuaries must be opened where wild animals can spend their time with their families. Ċ To summarize, I believe this creature must be present in the jungle in their natural habitat rather than locked up inside a cell. Even though, if zoos are open then government authorities should keep a clear eye on the wildlife and their health which is a crucial matter."
10718,Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?,"In recent years,the throw away culture of foods in shops and restaurants has become a hotly debated topic around the world.This essay will discuss the two main reasons that encouraged this wasteful notion and will then propose some remedies. Ċ Passing through a long period of time,the habit of leaving some foods behind has become more prevalent than ever before where the primary purpose is to flaunt out their financial situations. Such actions could be ascribed to the past culture where there are plenty of fresh ingredients and so forming this unthoughtful habit that still remains until present time. Ċ Furthermore,as I mentioned above,the quality of the products nowadays has changed a lot since the modern era began,which leading people to many discoveries that boost the effective of the methods of raising crops.Unfortunately,there are drawbacks such as vegetables and livestocks could not maintaining the original aroma.In other words,scientists nowadays intervene deeply into the development of raw ingredients which often seen in the case of genetically modified corns and meat.As a result,foods lost their value and not being well treated as before. Ċ In order to tackle the problems of food wasting,the government should promulgate a law that charging excessive foods.By doing that,many remnants will be save and society could so far avoided this problem.Moreover,raising people's awareness of potential diseases on their left-overs is extremely necessary and could be held by means of telecommunications. Ċ In conclusion,although it is true that foods are being grown faster and easier than ever before,still,food ordering should be strictly controlled by the authority.Going along with it is the telecom which holds an important responsibility in warning people about the capability of threads from the residues.Therefore,people could understand and mitigate the waste."
10719,"Some people believe social media is very important in our daily life, other believe it is waste of time. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","Social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram or Twitter have evolved so that they become an indispensable part of our lives. They are considered by some to be beneficial for us; others assume the contrary. This essay will discuss both points of view before my closing verdict. Ċ On the one hand, social media is a major source of entertainment for all people of all age category. Some applications , YouTube, for example , provide us with the content specific to our interests and the opportunity to group up society into the communities according to their outlooks on life. Moreover, social networking sites can be very useful in terms of education and work. For instance, the Microsoft Teams program allows schools and colleges to educate the students remotely retaining high quality. The same can be applied to the companies. Therefore, positive feedback on the online medium is quite reasonable. Ċ On the other hand, unlike in most public places , people can exploit the freedom they are given in social media. In other words, if someone behaves in an unacceptable manner , there is no one who would punish him. For instance , as racism is one of the hottest issues today ,many online users tease each other addressing their races knowing they can not be retributed. Also, these issues might inculcate the wrong overview of life for very young people.Unfortunately , these trends make the sceptics of social media be more adamant about their standpoint. Ċ To sum up, although social networking sites have some positive impact on our lives, they are also detrimental to a certain extent."
10720,Some psychologists recommend that to overcome stress in daily life we should do nothing at all for a period of time in the day. Ċ Do you agree or disagree ?,"Some psychologists suggest that we should not do anything for a period of hours in the morning and evening in order to reduce tension on a regular basis. I agree with this statement to some extent, but this is not the only solutions. This essay will highlight the other methods of overcoming such threats and express an opinion at the end. Ċ On the one hand, The first reason I believe that daily workload can be prevented by not doing any tasks for a while will help to mitigate stress. This is because people spend a plethora of time for working from the sunshine to sunsets without taking any break. In addition, some workers perform an office duty in a weekend. For instance, if they take a rest by doing various activities and spending quality time with their loved ones, it will make them psychologically relief. Furthermore, it assists to develop a strong relationship between family members. As a result, it can lead a delightful and healthy life. Ċ On the other hand, despite the living by doing nothing, travelling to the new places might be a better idea to cope mental problems. The commuting of the favourite areas with kith and kin provides a sense of happiness. For instance, a person who lives in the city as moving to the countryside on holidays for taking fresh air and escape of work burden can definitely supersede the mental overload. Similarly, the communication with others regarding work pressure would be beneficial to subside tension. Ċ In conclusion, although spending hours without having any responsibility can mitigate the worries, it does not work effectively every time. In my opinion, taking breaks and visiting to breathing taking and quite part of the country will certainly a relief mental pressure."
10721,"To date, various nations in the world has open opportunities for women to participate in the armed force. Some individuals consider the trend beneficial due to its gender equity nature, while others disagree with such policy.  To what extent do you agree with such a procedure? ladies in uniforms with guns","Nowadays, it is common to see more and more nations having opened opportunities for women to participate in the armed force. There is a great deal of controversy surrounding this issue for a long time. Ċ In the previous decades, women are usually considered helpless in our army. It is a discrimination. They are mainly given tremendous roles on their families rather than other things. It is their responsibilities to concentrate on family members. For instance, nature a child to be a productive adult. Ċ However, accompany by the women rights rising, women have been given multifunctional position. They could vote, teach, drive a taxi, capture criminals and so on.They could accomplish various things efficiently over our imagination, and also take good care on their families. Take Israel for example, there are massive riots and wars happened almost everyday. The demanding on armed force is necessary. They could feed their babies and fight for their country at the same time, it has been taken for granted in their culture. All residents should defend their country. Ċ Therefore, female could join the armed force has been a new trend all over the world. We should treat this issue in open-minded. It could happened that women be a part of our armed force members."
10722,More and more pollution and wastage produced. How common people are affected by pollution? What an individual can do to prevent it?,"In recent years, air pollution and wastage has risen dramatically, which has caused number of deterimental affects on common population. This essay will discuss some of those causes and measures that can be taken by individuals to deter their effects. Ċ One of the most significant issues pertaining to degrading quality of air is respiratory diseases. As an example, pollution in the city NewDelhi is so high that breathing there for 3 hours equals to smoking a cigarette as per the recent WHO survey. This is a pressing problem for common people because most of labour and essential workers spend most of their time during the day outside to fullfil their jobs. Therefore, they are exposed to pollution during the large portion of the day, disturbingly, which can decrease their life-span. Not only this, pollution has resulted in rising temperatures which has resulted in global warming around the world, which again brings more stress and difficulties on pockets of people as they will now have to spend more electricity to survive the hot day. Ċ Nevertheless, a number of measures can be implemented to control the increasing pollution, best of which is increasing the dependency on renewable resources for electricity rather than resources such as coal. In the recent survey, national pollution agency stated that in number of cities across india, 20% of the pollution is being caused due to the thermal power plants. Furthermore, mandating the use of high-efficiency vehicles and electric cars can create a significant reduction of pollution created by transport. Ċ To recapitulate, two main issues due to increased pollution that has been directly affecting common lives are respiratory problem and rising temperatures. However, such problem can be prevented by switching to non-conventional resources and electronic vehicles which will eventually control the falling air-quality."
10723,Question : An increasing number of people in these days prefer consuming fast food to home prepared ones. Why do you think this trend happen? What soft of problems might it bring into society?,"Over the last decade, consuming fast food have seen in the society life style. People would rather to buy ready-made meals than home-cooked ones. This essay will discuss some reasons why this occurred and examine the consequences of this worrying trend. Ċ The main cause of this problem is prolific increase in the number of fast food restaurant. For instance, on nearly every high street there are Mac Donald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken which they mostly open 24 hours per day. This ensuring that people who are busy in their work or even the students prefer consume these foods. Another cause of an inceasing consuer is interesting advertising that encourages people to buy. There are many exaggerate advertising that offer cut of price on their foods. That will lead consumers to think that they should order as long as foods in discount price. Ċ The effects of this have been and will continue to be very serious. The most problematic is helath problem. It will be a large increase in helath related dieases, especially diabetes. This debilitating illness means people have to be injected with insulin for the rest of their life. Furthermore, the social life may be influenced. Ready-made meals which are a quick and easy option to order lead people to change their eating habits. This will result in their family interaction since they have not enough time to eat together with the home prepared foods. Ċ To sum up, it is evident that there are several causes of increasing the number of fast food consumers. Thus, there are variety of negative effects as a result. Society must ensure to prevent this problem from deteriorating further."
10724,"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Write about the following topic: Ċ Some people think that hosting an international sports event is good for the country, while some people think it is bad. Discuss both views and state your opinion. Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 250 words.","Several individuals believed that bearing international games such as football or tennis is more advantageous for a community. However, others argue that it brings disadvantages. Personally, I advocate the first view opposing the second one owing to the fact that international sports provide the region's visibility. Although it is financial resources squandering. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments. Ċ On the one hand, arranging a worldwide event gives a national outlook. In others words, these events come with the press coverage exposing the land to stakeholders, entrepreneurs to the earth. Let's take South Africa as an example, the UN scientific study in 2011, pointed out that this state held the football world cup and since it, the country became 10 times more famous than in previous years. As a result, it soared the tourism attraction and businesses. Moreover, it became the overriding source of revenues for three consecutive years. Ċ On the other hand, part taking world play is resource frittering. Because of this, much money is spent on the construction of stadiums, mesmerising accommodations. Furthermore, providing a secure environment for all individuals involved, a huge amount of money is deployed. For instance, the scientific research carried out by the Oxford University in 2007 after the German world cup in 2006 showcased that more than 5% of the German PIB were utilized in solely one game city, enough money to build 500 schools and pave 300 roadways. Hence, the event was regarded as a failure by a plethora of critics. Ċ In conclusion, notwithstanding the international sports to be considered as taxes spending, it has undoubtedly rises the state' economic growth. Therefore, I still advocate the view. In addition, I recommend the local ruling power bears the organization of sports events in their lands."
10725,"Modern societies need specialist in certain fields, but not in others.Some people think therefore that governments should pay university fees for some stundents who study subjects that are needed by society.Those who choose to study less relevant subjects should not receive government funding.Would the advantages of such an educational policy outweight the disadvantages?","Many students go to universiry nowadays because they want to have a degree, to make a career.Some of them have to go to university because they need a qualification and advanced studies to get a better job.A university offers a wide range of subjects and also different fees for each course. Ċ Modern societies need specialists in any field because without somebody who can explain and give the work form genereation to generation.Without this kind of persons, that field would be dead because there are no workers nor any progress.If governemnts paid university fees only for students who choose to study subjects like: chemistry, engineering, physical science or other, many students would be disaadvantaged.Some of them would choose a course which is paid eventhough they don not have the abilities required.A thing like this would involve more disadvantages than advantages because it would eucourage people to choose only certain courses. Ċ We should understand that this world needs something from every field, to go on, to make a whole.For example, how can a house with a wonderful constuction be complete if there is not an artist,a painter to give that house colour.Governments schould come up with a solution that encourages every stundent to reach performance, to go beyond his limits, to be the best. Ċ To sum up, a modern society can bring opportunities to everyone, to fulfill their dreams, so governments schould think twice before making a decision about universities funding because this is a serious problm,especially for students who have to borrow money form banks.

10726,some people think that criminal behavior has genetic causes. others believe that it is circumstances that lead people to commit a crime. discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Crime has resulted in various disadvantages in the economy, such as mass murder. A number of people perceive that the genes are the most important factor for illegal activities whilst the remaining feel that situations which direct to execute an offence. In my opinion, it is the latter which most influence criminal behaviour. Ċ To embark on, the first cause of felony is genetics. This implies that some genetic material from parents associated with traits generally low intelligence, poor diet, impulsivity, and hyperactivity can be passed on to children. Furthermore, it triggers a variety of mental disorders like schizophrenia that leads to depression, which is the root of several offences. For instance, a study prepared in 2010 involving 10 individuals inheriting the above characteristics depicted that after 10 years 9 out of those beings ended up in prison. In other words, DNA inheritance can be a baluster for offensive manners. Ċ Secondly, the conditions in which a person is residing can oblige a human towards a misdeed. Moreover, constantly being bullied and poor family background can produce a habit of stealing or fighting among peers. For example, a survey conducted in 2021 in American jail demonstrated that most of the convicts have needy household upbringings. To put it more simply, the state of affairs can alter a personality as well as perspective. Ċ In conclusion, there are numerous explanations of an illicit manner particularly parents and circumstances. Although, if we do not suppress these matters, then, there will be a significant increase in criminals especially adolescents. Thus, it is beneficial to promote equality and strict laws against offenders."
10727,TASK:People spend their free time among the same group as themselves. Whereas some people enjoy spending time with all age groups. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"People are social beings by nature so it is normal for them to seek the companionship of others. But, an interesting point to see is the variation on how people choose their companions, and among several aspects to be considered, age is the common one. Certain reasons are observed on why people spend their leisure time with the same age group as well as those who prefer to go with different ones. Ċ Apparently, a person feels more comfortable around friends with the same age because they are more likely to have common interests such as hobbies and lifestyles. Thus, chances of being left out from these kinds of groups are low. Also, in games and sports, competing against someone at the same age level is believed to be fair as nobody has far more advantage in terms of experience and skills. Ċ On the other hand, some people prefer to be with a different age group, in most cases older than them, because they believe it can help them improve their knowledge and skills. Firstly, an individual can gain a diverse perspective of certain things by listening to the stories and experiences of others who are at a different age level. Secondly, in playing a game regularly with players who are more mature and experienced, one is bound to adhere the techniques and skills of their teammates as well as their opponents. Thus, a person benefits from this by way of improving his skills. Ċ In my opinion, it does not really matter much if you are in the same or different age group, either way could be beneficial to someone. I think what matters most is how you feel about being in the group, which one makes you happy and comfortable may it be during your leisure time or any other time."
10728,"Some people prefer activities and lifestyles in hot climates while others prefer ‎activities and lifestyles in cold climates. Discuss both views, and give your ‎opinion.‎","Many factors are considered when it comes to deciding where to live in. Climate has been always an important reason for choosing the right place. While some people believe that warmer weather is more suitable for them, others think that a cold climate is better. The two sides of this argument will be thoroughly analysed and discussed in this essay before drawing a reasoned conclusion. Ċ On one hand, by living in a warmer city, people could have more outdoor activities such as jogging or going on a picnic. Sadly, doing so in cold and cloudy weather would not be convenient for many. As growing up in colder places, many people, in the UK for example, prefer to go to Spain or countries in Latin America to enjoy the sunny weather. Ċ On the other hand, many believe that colder climates are energizing. Some people can't stand the heat and prefer chilly regions for it make them more active and fit to do their daily activities. The poetic and romantic feeling of cold is also prefered by many to have a walk or even a run. For instance, many tourists who live in hotter countries like UAE or Saudi Arabia travel to London in the winter to enjoy walking in the streets. Ċ To summarize, the two sides of the argument concerning the adequate climate to choose for doing activities have strong supports. However, after a thorough analysis of both sides, I personally believe that a colder climate is more suitable for active and lively individuals."
10729,"Nowadays, many people cannot read or write What problems does this cause? What measures can governments take to solve these problems?","In today's world, there are a number of people who are unable to read or write. Though this case has some problems, it could be alleviated by many effective remedies. Ċ On the one hand, a number of problems are resulted from the inability to read or write. First, when in important situations, people who have difficulty over reading and writing may not fully comprehend the information. As a result, they are more likely to be misled and do harm to themselves. Laborers, for example, who are incapable of reading, may be exploited physically as they do not deeply understand what is written in the contract. Second, since a person cannot write, he may run into a wide range of troubles, especially when it comes to dealing with the government and verifying legislative documents. For instance, those who are unable to write may not be able to finish required papers, such as making a petition to send their local authority, or giving signature. Ċ On the other hand, there are two solutions that can be implemented to tackle this issue. Chief among them is that the government should invest more money in education. For example, they should build more schools, especially those in the remote areas, or launch campaigns to raise people's awareness about education. Thus, people are likely to change their mindset about the importance of learning, and be able to approach it more easily. Secondly, there should also be well-trained staff who take responsibility for supporting these people. As a result, even if someone does not possess complete writing and reading skills, they would be able to get through administrative formalities. Ċ To sum up, regardless of the fact that there are some people who can neither read nor write, this situation could be effectively avoided by some ways suggested above."
10730,choice of learning method Essay topics: Some people believe that students in schools learn better when they study in groups. Others say school students learn better when they study on their own. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Nowadays, many believe that group learning will be more effective than individual learning for students, whereas, there is a contradictory notion about the superiority of individual learning. In this essay, will explore both sides of the debate and give my opinion. Ċ To begin with, individual learning enhances the concentration of students. This is because learning alone will prevent pupils from distraction from their teammate's discussion. Especially, to a lot of students who are introverts, it is onerous for them to come up with an idea when they are in crowd. Furthermore, studying by their own will improve the ability of working independently. A group include a lot of students in different levels and some are more talented than others will increase the possibility of develop the habit of just relying on these talented students. When they work alone without support from other, they learn by themselves; hence, their other soft skills like researching, seeking, also improve. Ċ On the other hand, group learning has is own benefits. Several students with different strengths and weaknesses can make up for each other. Specifically, if one person gives an idea and other will develop and nourish it, make it to become the best version of this group by giving their perspectives. Human being usually finds hard to realize their own mistakes so working together is a good way to take improve myself by objective and friendly judgment from teammates. Besides, it will improve teamwork skills of students. Even if you detest working with others but in our modern society, it is unavoidable. Therefore, it will give the students the best preparation for the working environment in the future. Ċ To sum up, two types of learning method have their own pros and cons. In educational environment we can combine these and use them flexibly in particular period of learning as well as in specific students."
10731,Proper function of prison is to punish criminals and life in prison should be hard. Do you agree or disagree?,"There is no shadow of a doubt that imprisonment life should be tough, and the main purpose of prison house is to penalize the offenders. I am in variance with this view because, in my opinion, the objective of jails is to rehabilitate criminals, further this essay will argue that punishment does not help to reduce the crime rates. Ċ To begin with, prison provides an opportunity for criminals to change their behaviour. This is because several developmental programmes are introduced in jails to teach them social skills and improve over the mistakes. For instances, the USA Psychology Department reveals in a recent survey that over 50% of culprits are less likely to indulge in crime after serving their time in prison as a rehabilitation centre. Therefore, prisons are meant to ameliorate the criminal’s life. Ċ However, some people believe that the primary role of prison should be to serve punishment to the people who do not obey laws. If criminals face brutality then there are few chances that they want to alter their nature. In addition, they will not be able to make a connection with society and remain isolated. Hence, their probability of reoffending crime will be increase. For example, a study by Federation University revealed, 60% of crooks again break the laws after treating with cruelty. Ċ In conclusion, although prisons are built to punish the offenders, I believe that if these jails used as establishment centre, then offenders become betterAdd an articlea betterThe noun phrase better person seems to be missing a determiner before it. Consider adding an article. Ċ show examples person in society and the rate of crime will also be reduced."
10732,"Some people think that children should obey rules or do what their parents and teachers want them to do, but others think that children who are controlled too much cannot deal with problems well by themselves in adulthood. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. childhood under supervision","It may be open to debate whether children should obey rules or behave precisely as their parents and teachers expect. Some believe in obedience, while others fear excessive control on children will erode their problem-solving ability in adulthood. In this essay, I will outline the essential arguments of both sides and come up with my own opinion. Ċ Advocates of strict upbringing build their point of view on the well-established theory that good manners are not developed by nature but by nurture. Innocent, energetic as children are, they cannot automatically grow into persons of great refinement. For this purpose, rules are introduced and children are brought up to polish their behavior accordingly. Ċ Yet that raises concerns that they will grapple with a variety of problems when they grow up. Docility involves being comfortable with existing rules, recommendations or even warnings, but the keys to successful problem solving do not necessarily fall into these boxes. When creativity is required, as is often the case in adult life, they will find themselves mired in confusion. Ċ Personally, I take on the pro side. It is noteworthy that even the most gifted children are not mentally developed yet, which means they do not have sound judgment and strong self discipline. Unshackled by rules or teachings, they are susceptible to temptations. Ċ Admittedly, both sides make sense. Children can only acquire good manners under the guidance of rules, teachers and parents, while their problem-solving ability might be undermined in the process. Despite the disadvantage, I support the idea that they should be placed under control, since it helps them navigate childhood without yielding to lures."
10733,"Rising university fees and scarce employment prospects for graduates have led some people to say that universities should not teach arts subjects,like philsophy and history and only offer practical degree courses that maximise chance of employment Ċ to what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued by a few people that universities should only focus on practical subject courses, due to limited job opportunities and expensive tertiary education. I partially agree to this statement, which I will explain in following paragraphs. Ċ To start with, in this contemporary world, as the population is on the rise, there are fewer places left for graduates.Every sector witness unemployment as there are myriad of candidates applying for a particular position.Thus, studying pragmatic subjects, such as accountancy, management or finance, is proactive step to secure the future. To exemplify, a lot of students are motivated to pursue commerce to make sure they won't be jobless in the future as this sector is on the rise to accommodate ever increasing candidates.In addition, certain degree's like philosophy and history have no relevancy in this technological advanced world. These subjects are reduced to books only, can not be applied to the real world. Ċ In contrast, although the pragmatic degree course provides benefits in the near future, arts courses can help in better decision in life.Philosophy renders better analytical skills which help a person to take right steps before commencing. Likewise, history teaches us about our previous generation, such as about work patterns and their modification throughout the decades.Moreover, these subjects improve writing skills to further increase chance of acquiring the job.For example, lots of companies hire people on the bases of their analytical and language ability to communicate better and taking the right decision in given circumstances. Ċ To conclude, while practical degree's are relevant to the future requirements, learning arts enhances interpersonal skills."
10734,Some people feel that global warming should be dealt with by governments. Others feel that it is responsibility of individuals in society to solve the problem. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"To reduce the increased temperature due to human activities on earth must be halted with the authorities' contribution. Although this notion is favoured by some parts of society, others have a counter-argument that to tackle this serious issue and apply people have to take some actions on their own. I agree with both arguments, and this essay will discuss the importance of each category to diminish this significant issue in the upcoming paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, the government not only helps to decrease the level of global warming by implementing strict laws but also can be aware of the population to minimize this problem. To elaborate further, the uses of fossil fuels by the industries at large scale and exhaust fumes produced from huge uses of private means of transportation by the people could be halted or reduced when the authority will employ solid law against overuse of these resources. For instance, a survey conducted recently has revealed that 40% of pollution can be minimized globally if society follows the issued law and order with responsibility. Moreover, the government can arrange awareness programs in urban and rural areas to save the environment by growing more trees. As a result, soil erosion and climate changes can be stopped long term. Ċ Nevertheless, this is an individual's responsibility as well to maintain the earth's climate. The first and foremost contribution by a human to change their habits toward lifestyle. They must travel in public transportation rather than their vehicles. This will reduce the level of exhaust fumes which are harmful to our atmosphere. To illustrate, people can use public transportation for commuting rather than their vehicles. Secondly, more biodegradable products must be utilized worldwide to reduce the global warming problem. Additionally, people could prefer those things which could be recycled and reused in future for a specific period. Hence, the environmentally friendly demeanour assist in reducing the temperature of the earth's surface. Ċ To conclude, after discussing both views, I unequivocally believe that the authorities and communities have to work simultaneously to solve this major issue. Government and inhabitants should be responsible at different stages to deal with global warming and get back to nature."
10735,"TOPIC: some people believe that team sports are very important for children to succeed in their career, others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Nowadays,team sports are a prevailing problem all over the world. Some think that team sports are crucial for the success of children in their career. Meanwhile, other people disagree. I think both opinions have several reasons. This essay will explain them. Ċ On the one hand, team sports are a suitable way to approach thinking skills of children which relate to the success of their career. Team sports support and inspire a deeper knowledge about thinking skills and logical strategies.Therefore, children can bring things which they learn in their team as meaningful experiences in order to achieve their goal. It is obvious that Vietnamese government always encourage children to participate in team sports which help children strengthen the development of thinking skills which are acquired their success. Children have many chances to have a bright future. Ċ However, apart from the benefits of team sports, this have some disadvantage which parents wanna prevent. It is true that Children are not old enough to handle severe problem in their team. Team sports do not always have a cooperation and harmony among members. Therefore, It leads to the competition and discussion of team. Moreover, most children can spend time-consuming task and filter out ideas on their thinking skill to apply for the success of their career. For example, Vietnamese scientists investigated a football team that most member who are children gain a bit experiences and misunderstand together without the guidance of adult. Ċ In conclusion, team sports play important role for the knowledge which serve the success of children in their career. However, this way have some drawback for them."
10736,Some people think that exercise is the key to health while others feel that having a balanced diet is more important. Ċ Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"Discussions related to maintaining health are among the top nowadays. Due to this reason, many opine that it is very essential to do any kind of physical activities related to gym or sports in order to remain fit. Others, however, contend that the diet plan is more important to ameliorate health. I shall discuss both these views and comes to the logical conclusion in further paragraphs. Ċ To commence with, exercising proves to be very mandatory in present due to the working schedules followed by masses.in other words, the requirement of mental-work might be more in the jobs or work than the physical movement which in turn develops sedentary lifestyle among humans. Moreover, in order to digest foods which are high in calories and proteins which might cause serious health issues if any kind of physical work is not done. For instance, research by the University of Delhi address that to cure diseases like high blood pressure or indigestion, running will be required to be embraced on a regular basis which eventually burns calories and boosts the immune system. Visting gyms or playing sports on a consistent basis is a perfect solution for this. Ċ On the contrary, adopting a healthy diet is also crucial to mitigate issues related to fitness. Firstly, if one follows the meals which come naturally from the god then chances for them to get infected by some diseases or problems might be very less. Secondly, weight levels could easily be managed or reduced by initiating good meal plan which does not need to practice the physical activity. For example,a report by the Fitness department demonstrates that the requirement of sports only arises owing to the consumption of fast foods. Thus, well-being could easily be maintained by eating natural foods. Ċ To conclude, According to my view Although focussing on taking balanced meal is necessary, the benefits acquired by doing physical activity will be more valuable because of the schedules followed by humans in which time is barely given to the exercise. Therefore, an equal amount of exercise along with a balanced meal is necessary to ensure good strength."
10737,You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Write about the following topic. Ċ Group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone. Ċ Do you agree or disagree? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 250 words.,"It is believed that cohort activities provide more relevant growth abilities than individual ones. Personally, I agree with the view owing to the fact that these tasks teach the cooperation techniques applied in real life. Although it has its disadvantages. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide evidence to prove the arguments. Ċ On the one hand, group task boosts individual cooperation capabilities. In other words, these activities enhance a wide variety of techniques such as : to be a good team player and communicating efficiently with others. Let us take football sport as an example, better coordination and understanding are needed to be well-succeed, the same skills, which are must in real soul. As a result, individual or collective goal is met, communities get connected and social issues are tackled. Moreover, this is the overriding reason for successful professionals worldwide. Ċ On the other hand, individual roles provide a unique personal experience to a person's heart rather than team roles. Because of the high demand for responsibility applied in these cases, it plays a pivotal role in in-person life. 60% of single players were reported to be the most skilled to deal with a wide range of existence day by day challenges than squad gamers for instance. Hence, it makes them prepared to deal with life issues. Furthermore, despite these groups of people tend to become more isolated and experience loneliness, they are fullfledged in terms of competencies. Ċ In conclusion, indeed, group duties train a crowd to endure real-life challenges than single ones, notwithstanding personal activities has their benefits. Therefore, I agree with the view and I endorse communities to enhance more team-based duties for sake of communal collaboration and understanding."
10738,Some people believe that it is a good idea that older people continue to work if it is possible for them to do. Do you agree or disagree ?,"It is widely believed that elder citizens extend work till their strength in the body for them. I strongly agree with this view of point, as I believe that aged people can work in a good manner after retirement also. Ċ First of all, the old persons can create more positive vibrations for the young population related to their job. This is because they do not depend on others money, this can lead to creating a problem in their family. For example, if older public stay in large cities is more expensive compared to a rural area, because of that fact needs more money in their life. While it is true that senior nation managing their health is difficult, so taking rest is also essential for them. Ċ Furthermore, if the persons are idle without doing any job, which leads to getting easily bored. A key reason for that does not have any responsibility for the next generation. For instance, in past everyone lived in a join family, but now the current situation is totally different where family members moved to everywhere depend upon their facilities. While there is no question that older human beings are good to work, it is clear that their family also support their effectiveness. Ċ In conclusion, the younger also provides more support to the older human kids for working after retirement, which will also have a positive effect on their family members. In my opinion, I think that both the older and younger person does not depend upon others, and this help to maintain a good relationship with the community."
10739,Men do most of the high-level jobs. Should the government encourage a certain percentage of these jobs to be reserved for women?  Use your own knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence. Different jobs for both gender,"With the rising of women's consciousness, there are more and more people advocate gender parity. Especially in work place, men dominate the more high positions than women do currently. I believe the government should protect a certain quota of the high-level jobs for women. Ċ The first reason is, obviously, men and women are definitely different in physical aspects. Thus, when it comes to the job regarding physical factor, for example, cement porter, women tend to show the less abilities than men do. Besides labor conditions, there is no reason for women to reach the same achievement as men do. Ċ The next reason I am on the position of supporting the government reserve the jobs for women is that it can stimulate the diversities. Because of sexual stereotype, the public often think women are emotional and cannot think as logical as men do. In my opinion, that argument is quite unfair since men are equal mad and exaggerated. Hence, women can use this kind of personality adequately, thinking in more considerate and detailed ways. Particularly for the higher positions, they usually need to manager people. I suppose that having more gender can boost more spark in career. Ċ Having said that, the opposite people argue that the behavior of limiting the certain percentage for specific gender is ironically against the parity itself. However, the history proofs that women had been treated as second people for a long time. Compare to men, women got the working right after World War two, which was less than a hundred year to now. Therefore, I strongly support that ensuring the women working right is the right path toward a equal society. Ċ To conclude, it seems reasonably clear that the government should be encouraged to make a growth of high position quantity for women."
10740,Some people think that women are generally more peaceful than men as their characters are naturally more nurturing than aggressive. To what extent do you agree/disagree.,"In the sophisticated era, women play a cardinal role in the life of every person because they work equally like men in every profession. According to the some women are more calm and they possessed good personality. Also, they are more upbringing than men. I am personally inclined to agree with the statement that women are peaceful as compared to men. This essay will elaborate the possible reasons behind it in the subsequent paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, women are participating equally in all professions like as men such as doctor, police force, business, and movies. They have a great role in everyone's heart. Furthermore, they have umpteen responsibility, they have to work as a mother, daughter and a wife. Women always supporting for social news and always stay active in society site. Hence, there is a significant role of women in the activity of every person and they should be helped to the citizens in any good or bad situation. Ċ Women are more peaceful and better personality than men, because most of the men like to introvert in themselves and they always like to do indoor activities instead of involving in any other social activities. They mostly enjoy indoor activities. Such as, watching television, listen to music and playing some video games. However, women always decide to do each and every task in their life and they prefer outdoor activities and want to become extrovert. They have a plethora of obligation, but they do not lose their temper easily. Thus, women have good characters because they are extrovert and multitasking. Ċ To recapitulate, it is said that women have a lot of will power as a result, they handle every situation in their life. A woman is considered as the backbone of the man."
10741,"People these days watch TV, films, and other programmes alone rather than with other people. Ċ Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","There is an argument tells that nowadays people love to enjoy TV programs by themselves not with others. This may lead to several advantages and demerits. I believe that the benefit of this technology innovation may outweigh the disadvantages. Ċ To begin with, technological development reveals a lot of easy ways for people to entertain or gain pieces of information current days. For example, news from over the world might be worldly known just in seconds. There are several entertainment choices provided on the internet and TV and it helps people to enjoy based on their preferences such as mothers prefer to watch soap operas in films platform while fathers prefer to watch sport on TV. They do not have to argue with each other because there are many sources that provide entertainment. In addition, it brings a positive impact to education because accessing educational content is way much easier currently and children may watch it alone for their study without being bothered or bothering other families. Ċ On the other hand, social life might be unaware recently because man is more comfortable enjoying TV programs or other entertainment by themselves. For instance, years ago TV is considerably rare in the house so that only rich families have them. In my hometown, back then citizens used to watch TV in that particular house or in the village office together. It was built a family bond among them and people became aware of each other. This situation is commonly rare these days and it is the negative effect of technology. Hence, the demerit of this innovation cause lack of social life amongst citizens. Ċ To sum up, there are several benefits of technology innovations in terms of gaining pieces of information more quickly, various entertaining contents and so on, while the negative impact has to deal with individualism between people. I believe the advantages might outweigh the disadvantages by wise using the technologies."
10742,"TOPIC: In many countries, students who behave badly in class are expelled from their schools and never allowed to return. Many consider this an effective way to educate while others disagree. Discuss both sides and have your own opinion","In many schools, students are expelled for their poor behaviours. Some people argue that this is a suitable punishment to have a better educational environment. However, it is also disagreed by many others. In this writing, both sides will be analyzed before a conclusion is reached. Ċ On the one hand, tough punishment is crucially important to strengthen principles of schools. For example, when a student is dropped out of school for stealing a mobile phone, there is a great possibility that other bad students will not risk their educational prospect for a similar mistake. This will certainly bring about a better school. Thus, the benefits that come about when misbehaving children cannot continue their study can be seen. Ċ On the other hand, education is significantly crucial for anyone's future. The fact is that e person's social status is best enhanced with high educational level. Whereas, students that are expelled from school usually end up with crimes and drugs. Therefore, it is reasonable that children should not be out of school for any reason. In addition to this, students are very young and vulnerable to impulse actions that cause serious consequences. They should be forgived and educated with an effective method instead of being pushed into a risky society at such an early age. Ċ As the above illustrates, the punishment of forcing poor students out of school leads to a more self-disciplined environment among students. However, the detrimental ramifications seem to outweigh the benefits. Such excecution negatively affects the students and the society as a whole. It is hoped that all schools will give bad children more chances to correct their mistakes."
10743,"responsibility to society. topic: Some people think they have done all they should do to society by paying taxes, but other people think people should take more responsibilities. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is quite common these days for citizens to have a responsibility to take actions to contribute to a better society. With a conflicting view about how much responsibility they have to take, some citizens regard paying taxes as the whole duty they have to their country and community. Ċ Advocates believe they have fulfilled their responsibility and duty through paying various tax, such as the VAT and income tax, since government could enhance economy to run smoothly as well as invest in social systems. For example, with tax revenue, the government is able to build more high-speed trains and improve the healthcare system. However, what government can do with tax revenue is just from the strategic level, while the dwellers can take more responsibilities in many other aspects. Ċ An ideal society is not only determined by economy and high-quality lifestyle, education and reputation also need to be taken into consideration. Everyone in the society is a role model for children who are most likely to imitate other's behavior, thus to be an educational and motivational person is indeed an important responsibility for people to take in order to foster the young generation. Ċ In addition, there are also occasions when citizens need to put their best foot forward to establish a good reputation for our community. It is hard to imagine what others would think of you, if you throw the garbage on the street only because there is not any trash cans in the vicinity. Ċ In conclusion, my view is that although tax revenue can solve part of social issues, just paying taxes alone is not enough for citizens to fulfill their duties. It is better for them to do something effective in person that contribute to education and good reputation."
10744,"TOPIC: All education (primary, secondary and further education) should be free to all people and paid and managed by the government. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Nowadays, whether all individuals should be entitled to unchargeable education has been receiving a great deal of public attention. While I partly agree that training should be sponsored by the government, I disagree it should be costless for everyone. Ċ Free education is reasonable for several reasons. First, everyone has equal rights to education. This means both the wealthy and the poor are entitled to learning, which makes those who are impoverished have the chance to be lifted out of poverty and get better career opportunities and future. If not, only children from privileged backgrounds can access to education and be better prepared for their future, and juveniles from poor background learn that all attempts, effort they make are useless, and they could not positively change their lives, which perpetuates a cycle of the wealth gap and postpone the country's development and prosperity. Ċ In the other hand, I believe that education should not be free to everybody. This is because most people do not appreciate the value of free training. To be more precise, the number of pupils would be irresponsible to their studies and lose motivation to strive, which leads to low academic results and a waste of investment of government in those students, and a financial strain. Besides, the government only should sponsor for gifted individuals such as Mathematical ingenious students, which helps them fulfil their dreams, and their capabilities would boost national advancement in numerous fields such as science and economy down the road. Ċ In conclusion, although free education is advantageous in a great deal of aspects, it should not be uncharged to all individuals."
10745,"When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the contemporary era, there is a heated argument over the issue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. A lion's share of the society favours it, however the rest goes adverse it. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centres are just as important as parks and gyms in a municipality. The following paragraphs would highlight my personal perspective with an apt example. Ċ I see eye to eye, with the central idea for various reasons why public facilities are crucial to metropolis inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbours. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighbourhood. Ċ On the loggerhead, some critics go against the above discussed assertions. As a result, parks and gyms give the city dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping centre could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families. Ċ To Conclude, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centres are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents."
10746,Some people suggest that childern do not understand the world of work and schools should make all teenagers spend a short time working as well as studying academic subjects. To what extent do you agree?,"Nowadays, working and the meaning of working for children is of utmost importance and learning how to work from an early age has played a primary role for children. I believe that children should be taught so as to figure out the world of work. This essay will explain the benefits and the drawbacks of working and studying for students simultaneously. Ċ First of all, working for a short time can provide children with great opportunities to gain experience before entering real and large workplaces. In this regard, they can become familiar with a wide range of professions and job requirements. In this case, if schools make it compulsory that all teenagers spend a short time working as well as studying the school's subjects, it will be beneficial significantly for them in that they can be experienced and, in return, students are more likely to be valuable workforces for both the society and themselves. From a psychological point of view, being experienced sooner than the expected time can broaden their horizons and, in the next step, open the door to children to be successful in their careers. Ċ Secondly, another advantage would be that working shortly from an early age can give adolescents a sense of responsibility and identity. Therefore, they are more likely to be upstanding members of society in the future. However, it is worth mentioning that working at school time would have some disadvantages as well. For instance, they may not concentrate on the academic lessons, and if this happens, they will not obtain qualifications. Nonetheless, the drawbacks are not confined to this, and possibly children will face a number of problems. Ċ To sum up, although working at the school time might have some shortcoming, the benefits are far more, and I agree entirely with spending a short time working whilst children are going to school."
10747,The care of old people is a growing problem. Some say the government should care for old people. Others say that it is the family’s responsibility. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"An increasing problematic issue looks after aged people.It is argued that caring for old people is whether the response of their relatives or the government .I believe that this topic has to handle both by their family and the government. Ċ Initially,the main task of governance is to solve the problem of the public.This means repairing the road or look after aged people.For instance,a few years ago my neighbour lost her husband and nobody have left to look at her from her blood relatives,social care have solved this problem and they send to local caring agenda which support by the government.Thus,the government has to play a role in this position. Ċ On the other hand,the meaning of family is to help each other in any case.That means,nobody can deny that we all will be aged in the future and so everybody needs to care from somebody.For example,In Turkey where I grow up, the population of kids of parents are more than one kid because of the reason of the fear that when they aged they need somebody to look after them. Furthermore,the family how looked their kids in their required time later on while their parents will get older that kids, when they grow up, must look after their elder relatives. Ċ In conclusion,it is surely true that we are ageing time by time and this makes us addicted to other body because of ageing.This makes a problematic matter for both their children and the governments.I would say in my centre heart that issue should be couraged firstly by their family and then by the authorities."
10748,IELTS QUESTION Some think that giving a weekly allowance to children will help them to face less problems when they are adults. Do you agree or disagree? ANSWER:,"Allowance gives motivation for children to do their work and it is less difficulty when they became adults. To accord this statement, I completely agree it will be useful for children to manage money at young age with proper guidance. Ċ Some of the benefits of allowance for children are ability to learn about finance, responsibility about money, consequence of decision making. For emergency period, pocket money helps them if they miss their bus pass. Children will learn about money management skills. It gives them to satisfy their needs. For instance, it allows them to buy their own necessary item like books. It motivates kids to get their chores done. Ċ On the other hand, if children given weekly allowance they think less about money. Paying kids for doing chores make them to think working for money isn't fun. They demand for complete each activity in the home to pay for it. Sweets are very cheap; they use allowance to buy them plenty. If they get money freely they will use it lavishly. They use it for bad activity like smoking, drug, and so forth. For example, the report says that children are spending money for smoking and also illegal activity. Ċ In a nutshell, though giving an allowance to children by weekly helps to know about benefit about money but it will destroy their lives without any supervision. So parents should be high alert on giving allowance to children, they will spend amount on unessential activity. Parent should take care about all the expenses which relax children to focus only on studies."
10749,"The best way to reduce poverty in developing countries is by giving up to six years of free education, so that they can at least read, write and use numbers. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is often argued that making primary schooling free can be fundamental to guaranteeing everyone accesses to education . Some people believe that it can be considered an effective solution to poverty. In my opinion, I completely agree with this view and think that free schooling is the best way to fight poverty. Ċ Firstly, Government should make elementary studies free of charge because it can help students not abandoning school and then become positive and productive members of society . There are plenty of families in developing nations that cannot fully afford to send their children to school. Consequently, these students will be forced to abandon their studies and be exposed to be unemployed and in some cases criminals in order to earn money to afford their living . For example , researches show that nations in which the level of unemployment is higher suffer more from economic problems . That is why this method can be a useful solution to this issue . Ċ Secondly, primary learning helps children to develop several skills and abilities. In other words, education will help individuals to grow because they will obtain a better understanding of life and get more knowledge and skills . therefore , pupils will gain financial stability in the future because they may have the possibility to land a good job and a high paying salary. Ċ In conclusion , I strongly believe that making elementary free of charge can offer a long term solution to the country's economy because it may reduce the problem of abandoning schools and helps children to develop skills and abilities ."
10750,Tourism is causing environmental problems all around the world. What are the main causes of this? What are some solutions?,"It cannot be denied that the ongoing environmental issues are due to the dramatic increase in the tourism industry all around the countries. This essay will explicate the two causes of this phenomena and explain how we can tackle this obstacle in the coming years. Ċ To commence with, the primary reason for this occurrence is deforestation that causes climate change. In other words, people are cutting down the trees for the construction of roads to promote tourism. For example, the recent news published by “The Kathmandu Post” was written that on the way to Muktinath, there occurred a dangerous bus accident due to a landslide. To mitigate it, the possible reason to halt this situation requires the legal authorities intervention as the government can impose some law to maintain the number of cutting trees. Also, the plantation of various useful flora programme should be carried out by making some new legal laws for the implementation. Ċ Another problem is the overuse of natural resources that causes global warming. To explain it, the consumption of petroleum products for the tourist is rising day by day that leads to environmental pollution which can create different disease. For instance, recent research done by The Tribhuwan University revealed that The Kathmandu valley which is known as the city of tourist is more polluted and also the kids in that area are unhealthy than the other places. To cope with this, people’s attitude should be changed to forge a compromise with their consumption behaviour to protect the environment. In addition, the government should also consider the reduction of this situation. Ċ In conclusion, a decrease in flora and fauna and high consumption of fuel leads to natural disaster as well as pollution. Also, these problems can be solved if human try to maintain the natural world with rule and regulation which should be imposed by the government."
10751,People have little understanding of the importance of the natural world. What are the reasons for this and how can people learn more about the natural world？,"Currently, humans do not know specifically about the necessity of the ecosystem, which is essential for their survival. There are several reasons for this, but also a number of measures that we can take. Ċ First of all, maybe people understand that the environment needs preserving, but as it can bring about financial benefits, they neglect that thinking and just care about the short-term benefits instead of the long-term ones. Therefore, people exploit all the natural resources, which provides them high revenues to increase their profits. Take logging, as an example, forests and jungles, known as the lungs of the Earth, are being destroyed heavily now for trading since this is a high-income industry. As a result, many natural disasters having an adverse effect on the life of humans occur, such as soil erosion or severe floods. The other cause is that despite being taught how important nature is, people still do not have the awareness of protecting it. For instance, some individuals deliberately throw litter on the streets and beaches, hunt wild animals illegally and dump toxic waste into the seas by design. This results in the presence of plastic in the oceans, the extinction of rhinos and the death of marine creatures. Ċ However, to lessen the problem, the main idea is that governments and the public must join hands together. First, policymakers should launch some propaganda campaigns to raise the awareness of their people, but those plans need to suit different age brackets. To illustrate, as for kids and youngsters, the message can be conveyed through vivid videos and real illustrations, including animations or stories on television about how important the ecosystem is and what the repercussions are if the natural world is kept on being polluted. As for adults, authorities should issue strict regulations about protecting the environment. Take Singapore, as an example, anyone who lets garbage on the roads will be fined for $10. Consequently, everyone will realize and pay more attention to the dangers threatening the planet now: global warming, natural depletion and so on. They should stop polluting the Earth and reuse whatever they can instead of throwing away. Ċ In conclusion, nature can be harmed and due to its importance, if it is destroyed, humans will be affected seriously. So protecting the environment is just like protecting yourself in front of any catastrophes."
10752,Assignment: What are your thoughts on the idea that television has turned out to isolate people instead of bringing them together?,"While ostensibly the television has turned out to isolate people, actually it depends on how the uses manage it. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, to have a positive, the owner should use it wisely. Ċ Most of the objects are created to have a useful usage, but sometimes we are the ones who create negative consequence. Many people think that now the television has made people to enclose themselves in the house and stop having contacts with friends and family. In my case, my parents are always busy. However, there is a time when all the family comes together and it is television time. Therefore, the television doesn't isolate my family, but make us come together. Ċ I have a friend who doesn't talk to anyone when she is watching television, and she tends to watch it alone. Nevertheless, she doesn't watch television for a long time, so she also spends a lot of time with her friends and family. Ċ Some people think that when the neighbourhood only had few television sets, people tend to have closer relationships. If we think in the same way, should we have few fridges in the community, so we can spend more time with our neighbour? Ċ In conclusion, determining if the television has turned out to isolate people or not, it depends on how the owner use it. The television set is a tool for us. Therefore, we should use it wisely in order to have positive influences such as bring the family or the neighbourhood together."
10753,It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay. small town or a metropolis for a child's good?,"The countryside, in comparison to big cities, outlines some widely different characteristics, environmentally speaking as well as socially. And, taking into consideration the rather special atmosphere children need to live in a healthy way as well as assure their well-being, which place is better to live in remains a prominent question. Ċ Personally, I do not fully agree to the fact that growing up in the countryside is more beneficial to children than living in a big city, mainly because each one of the two different places are devoid of particular opportunities for children. Ċ Firstly, if living in a small village on a plain where green is a dime a dozen and fresh air is the well of immortality, provides infinite and everlasting jubilation, shortage of Wi-Fi, transit and easy access to information may be a source of worry and surely will fret you even with the healthiest of environments. Thus, it is, definitely, a nightmare to live disconnected from social life. Ċ Secondly, for a child, a big city would give him multiple opportunities to learn new skills, discover their talents and embrace their career at an early age. He or she would also be allowed to have all sorts of medical and diet help to have a strong body at the age where they need sufficient nourishment to be developed. Ċ In conclusion, although a sane, clean and fresh atmosphere is absolutely needed for a little child, the city might be giving him or her the chance to have a well-balanced life in the long term by bringing the whole world to the kid's hands to explore."
10754,Some people think that uniform at school is unnecessary and should be banned. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Certain individuals believe that students should not be allowed to wear uniforms while attending schools as they find no benefits in doing so. However, I completely disagree with this notion. In contrast, I think children should be encouraged to dress in uniform because by wearing them, they become easily distinguishable from ordinary people which on some occasions, can act in their own interest. Ċ Firstly, wearing a uniform not only gives the person the confidence and prestige of being a student but also helps him to be identified easily in the public. For example, if a student has been involved in a car incident, authorities and police can easily reach out to his family and access his personal details by simply referring to the school that the student's uniform belongs to. Furthermore, wearing the same dress can be an indication of levels of discipline and cohesion in the school. Ċ In addition, Because children spend the majority of their time studying in classrooms, a school-provided unifrom can significantly reduce the costs associated with purchasing clothes for youngsters. this will be particularly helpful for low-income families who might face difficulties providing stationery and dressings for their children. For instance, if a child from such a family has been given a uniform from the school, it will help him to avoid being ostracized as well peer pressure that he may encounter in his class. Ċ In conclusion, I must say I strongly disagree with those who assume uniforms do not serve any purpose. I believe they must be compulsory as they have proven to be beneficial for both the students and their families."
10755,"Psychological illnesses may not be as obvious as physical disabilities or illnesses. Nevertheless, they are just as disabling in their own way. Society, however, is more accepting of those with physical than psychological illnesses or disabilities, The latter being regarded as a taboo subject sometimes. To what extent do you agree with this view?","It has been observed that mentally challenged people are less likely to be accepted by the public and physical disabilities are treated with more empathy than mental illnesses. I strongly disagree with the statement and believe that society is getting more tolerating to mental disordered people. Ċ To begin with, people have been more open to psychological illnesses because they have become more aware of the importance of mental health in their lives. When people are mentally ill, they are not able to work productively, to form positive relationships and manage life’s challenges. For instance, it is probably difficult for a person with speech anxiety to present his or her project in a work meeting as well as communicate effectively in public. As a result, people have paid more attention to their mental health by doing physical activities, adopting healthy diets and practicing meditation. Ċ Another reason is that some people with mental disorders are geniuses with hidden talents. Children with autism or hyperactive might be considered mentally disordered atSuggestionin the first place because they come across with uncommon behaviours. However, many of them have shown their interests or talents in music, technology, drawing or circus performance. For example, a successful Vietnamese acrobat was diagnosed with autism at the age of three. The more he grew up, the more he showed his interest in circus performance. With the support of his parents, he kept practicing and now works as a professional performer. Being aware of these cases, not only families, but also the society have sought methods and treatments to cure and open their arms to people with psychological disorders. Ċ To conclude, awareness of the public to mental health and special gifts of mentally challenged people has been enhanced. Thus, they have become more empathised towards those people and supported them in many different ways."
10756,"Some people prefer to work on school projects with a group, while others would rather work alone. Ċ Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Most educational institutions encourage students to indulge in teams since it helps in better growth on individual as well as social development. Group activities improve few essential qualities such as confidence, creativity and decision making. On the other end few scholars prefer to go solo. However, there are community who prefer that scholars should involve with groups and I agree with their opinion. Ċ Moving to the side there are scholars who unite together to form groups. They are observed that they achieve their goals productively. Due to different perspective of people existing in the team, many ideas come into the table while brainstorming. If one got stuck with a huddle, then there are others to solve the matter, thus guides them to improve the productivity and checks time balance for the given assignment. For instance, in a mathematics assignment suppose one is good in geometry and other in trigonometry, hence supporting the other kind. Unity also helps oneself in upgrading skills by learning or practising from the others in the crew. Ċ On the other side, there are individual who completes work single handedly. Hence the radius for brainstorming is confined or limited. This can mostly represent that the scholar is an introvert who is less confident to confront his thinking or views with others resulting in to finish the task all by himself which may conclude to degrade the level of overall performance. For example, a member has strong ideas but is unable to confront others due to his shy behaviour. Many teenagers do not like to share success credits with others while few fail to fit for the team due to lack of sufficient or required skills, can be substitute cases for acting separately. Ċ In a nutshell, from my opinion scholars should be motivated to work in groups rather than solo, Afterall teamwork is the basic requirement in any work field as nothing can be achieved singly. Not only the institute even parents should encourage them to unite to achieve any job requirements."
10757,"Digital communication technology, such as email, instant messaging and social media, has improved communication and connections between people. Ċ To what extend do you agree or disagree?","It is indeed true that electronic media has transformed the methods of conversation and connection among the general public. I completely agree with this statement due to two main reasons. Firstly, people can communicate at any time with their relatives. Secondly, social networking websites helps in making new connections for the public. This essay will intend to analyse both arguments in detail with relevant examples. Ċ First of all, these days, the populace can contact their friends and relatives in a few seconds. With the invention of email, phone messages and social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter, people can share their information, emotions, and secrets easily without any delay. For example, I daily talk to friends through social media and exchange thoughts and useful information. In contrast, it was not possible in the past and masses often had to use letter and telegram to share information. Therefore, web media has revolutionalized the methods of conversation among masses. Ċ Moreover, people can develop a huge friend circle with digital technology. These days, if people have the desire to proliferate their social group then they may use Facebook and Twitter to connect new people. It has been observed that this digital platform is far more convenient and effective to connect public as compared to conventional methods such as group meeting and social gatherings. For example, nowadays, the maximum populace has 100 to 200 friends on Facebook without physical meeting. Hence, the public may increase their social circle with digital technology . Ċ In conclusion, electronic media has changed the way of conversation and connection between the general public. I firmly believe that with this innovative revolution not only people can communicate at any time with their relatives but also this enables them to develop new bondings with other people."
10758,"write an essay explaining your own difficult decision. a personal decision, career decision or a family decision . explain why the decision was difficult , and describe the pros and cons (pleas rate out of 10 and tell me if there is any mistakes)","After I finished the first year of high school , I had to choose between entering the scientific section or the literary section. This was a hard decision for me because I was up in the air about what I wanted to do after high school. My family pressured me to enter the scientific section because if I didn't enter the scientific section, I won't be able to get a good job. Ċ When I got my grades for the first year I realized that I have failed In math and physic. I didn't have to think too much about my decision because the Head teacher told me that if I entered the scientific section , I will finish high school after four years instead of three. And that was the deciding factor for me to enter the literary section . Ċ One year later after I finished the second year in high school I was convinced that the literary section wasn't for me so I started thinking about the pros and the cons of going to the scientific section . I was stuck between a rock and a hard place because I have finished one year on the literary section and if I went to the scientific section I will have to study one more year . however if I enter the scientific section , I will be able to find a good job with a lot of money ,so I can get married and settle dawn. Finally I made up my mind and have decided to go to the scientific section. Ċ If I had only listened to my family I wouldn't have wasted a year of my life . Of Corse I don't regret my first decision . I had learned a great lesson from that experience. I should always listen to my parents ."
10759,"Some people have great ambitions in life, others don't. Do you think ambition is important to succeed in life? Is it a positive or a negative quality to have?","Today some people have their lives with great ambitions, others don't. Human being may be greed if the embrace exceeded ambitions, by contract, it is beneficial if citizens process proper ambitions. Ċ Once a person have enormous ambitions, it is available to reach the goal which they are struggling for, they must be passion, energetic, then they have more chances to get what they want. For instance, a man who are the only person to earn money for his family, a strong ambition is got by him, he has been fought for any opportunity to meet his aim of gaining the manager position. Eventually, he gets what he was admiring, that's because of his powerful ambitions. Therefore, ambitions has its positive side. Ċ However, ambition also does harm to the individuals with a over ambition., It is necessary to got the ambition under control. For example, residence who are too crazy about accessing the approach of getting the particular score or a great amount of money, he will fail to control his greedy, then everthings are change, The purpose isn't the initial purpose. Ċ In conclusion, I believe ambition is vital to be successful in life. A proper ambition do help us in the way of searching succeed, but remember it is dangerous when we ask for too much. Meanwhile, we will lost and forget the preference what we fought for in the beginning."
10760,Some psychologists think that the best way to overcome stress in everyday life is to spend a portion of the day doing absolutely nothing. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is undeniable that people have faced stress problems from their affairs. Psychologists recommend that doing nothing is the best solution to eliminate this concern. Personally, I argue this statement with many reasons that will be discussed in the following paragraphs. Ċ First of all, people can eliminate the stress level by better methods such as exercise or doing their favourite hobbies. Working out not only the beneficial mind but also the physical. Pleasure hormones named Endorphine will be released during doing this activity in terms of mental health while they can get stronger bodies. In other words, finding something to do that can have more advantages than staying inactive. If they are obsessed with the art field, they will be able to try a new work or improve their skill during this period. Meanwhile, some people who don’t have the kind of activities that they can start at this time too. Ċ Secondly, they have their own ideas about anxious feelings. Few societies believe that being idle can create some negative behaviours like laziness whereas some groups are guilty of their actions because they waste time without doing benefits. In addition, they can be judged by their community for being a person who is not productive. As a result, they need to be active throughout the day to feel comfortable. Ċ To conclude, I strongly disagree that allocating a part of the whole day to be passive is the greatest choice to get rid of anxiety. The reason why I have this opinion is that they have other useful ways to solve this problem and their own thinking."
10761,Some people with good education and experience in their field decide to move abroad to work. Why do you think that is? What problems does this cause?,"Nowadays, people from developing countries equipped with valuable knowledge and skills in their professions are willing to move to developed ones for several reasons. In this essay, I will explain the causes and the results of this movement. Ċ To begin with, most of the professionals migrate abroad, since they are provided with a high standard of living such as strong legislation, clean environment, huge income, good working atmosphere, and more job opportunities. To illustrate, most of the capable students in Azerbaijan desire to go to the EU or the USA for education and career. In addition to this, some scientist also wants to change the country, because organizations in there create better conditions for scientific activities. For example, NASA offers the most improved technologies to engineers working for it. Ċ However, it has negative impacts on the home country. The movement of educated people leads to the shortage of skilled workforce and it kills the competition in the local labour market. Also, it affects wages in jobs that require well-educated workers. As some students leave the country due to the undervalued of their professions, the government has to invite specialists from abroad at a higher cost. For example, last year, BP in Azerbaijan brought two engineers from Italy to repair the oil rig due to staff shortages and the money spent on them in 12 days was 76,000 manat. Moreover, this scarcity can cause a recession in the economy, in more details, it can lead to fewer taxes. It is fact that the main source of the governmental budget is tax, therefore, if it decreases, the investments of the state in sectors that serve social and economic welfare will decline. Ċ In conclusion, although the migration of well-educated people to developed countries has a positive effect on their personal well-being, it brings about a brain drain to their nation and lagging of their economy."
10762,The cost of living is higher in many countries. What is the effects of higher prices to individuals and society? What is the best way for people to deal with this problem?,"Wages of citizens in many countries cannot cover spendings owing to cost-of-living is higher than a salary rate that occasionally are pushed into poverty, and leads society to ambiguous aftermaths. Thereof, many people cut back their purchases, and no matter has debts, in account of one the best way to deal with this problem is not exist. Ċ First of all, the undeniable fact that the high cost of living demands equal a salary rate, or citizen became poverty that lead to harmful effect on both society and individuals. In Ukraine, for example, prices outrun a wage rate that leads to many debts and increase a criminal level. Moreover, people preserve money by purchasing cheaper and less quality products that lead to many problems with health. Thus, if a country has a high price that a wage can cover for people and society itAccept comma additionsociety, it is not a big deal, whereas when price outrun a salary it has devastating effects on both. Ċ Thereafter, society in a country, where the price is higher than a salary, every day figure out a new way to cope with such problems, although the best still is not exist because every single day people have different problems that draining their budget. Many families, for instance, apart from basic needs have sometimes problems with health or clothes, especially if they have children. Therefore, such people endeavour preserve money, and have a job in two places as way to manage the shortage of capital; however, it has not always helped. Consequently, people many years try to find out the way that solve problem with the shortage of money, nevertheless one and the best is impossible owing to different situations demand various solutions. Ċ To conclude, cost-of-living is higher than wages in many countries that has devastation chain effects on individuals and society because push people to controversial decisions. Furthermore, nonetheless all efforts people cannot find the best idea to cope with such problems due to society presently lives in the turbulent time there every day are happening something bad that drains the budget of everybody."
10763,"higher fuel and petrol cost Topic: The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars.  To what extent would you support or reject this idea?","There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion. Ċ One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities. Ċ However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis. Ċ Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil. Ċ To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars."
10764,Q.  Newspapers have an enormous influence on people's ideas and opinions. Is it a desirable or undesirable situation?,"Newspapers nowadays have become an indispensable part to acquire information compared to other resources in the modern life. Some people advocate that it is beneficial for people to accumulate knowledge, while others consider that it will deprive people of their thoughts. Indeed, in my stance, there are some drawbacks of the newspapers. Ċ The first and most important reason is that people's thoughts are easily influenced by newspapers. That is, people are passive to absorb the information and tend to mimic the opinions from newspapers. For example, people with hustle and bustle lifestyles are too busy to verify the truth of the topics in newspapers. Meanwhile, those information are widely use in every field which has a strong impact on every age. In the long term, people are likely to lose their judgement. Ċ Another reason is that most of newspapers are controlled by political parties and served the authorities. It is easy to provide biased reports and manipulate the reader's prospectives on the vital issues. Furthermore, it is common to use entertainment news or celebrity secrets to divert public's attention away from the government scandals, economic problems, unemployment, crimes and so on. It allows people hardly to focus the main issue and may be harmful to country's development. Ċ In conclusion, newspapers have been integrated into our daily life and has a strong impact on the way people gain knowledge. There is no denying that people will lose their thoughts and ideas if they passively absorb the information from newspapers. For the great regret in lives, people should cast a discriminative eye on it."
10765,Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"The issue of climate change was always debatable and has become more controversial. Many people claim that people have more responsibility to fight climate change, while others reject this notion. The substantial influence of this trend has sparked controversy over the potential impact in recent years. In my opinion, we should work more to fight against climate change to be more rational. This essay will elaborate on both points of view of this issue and thus lead to a logical conclusion. Ċ There are myriad reasons that will further explain this argument. Still, the most predominant one stems from the fact that the environment has significant influences on our wellbeing, and hurting the earth means hurting ourselves. The Covid-19 pandemic has vividly demonstrated this. The virus can spread due to our poaching of wild primates' nature. As a result, many countries took damaging blows to their economies and the life of their citizen. Furthermore, many prominent business chains do not have to spend significant money on carbon emissions. In that situation, if citizens do not raise their voices against pollution, the government does not follow the legislation to protect the environment. Ċ On the other hand, some others believe that global warming is most appealing for economic practices. Poor communities are unable to afford environment-friendly methods of production. For example, from 2020, The tech- giant company Apple did not provide charging adapters with iPhones upon purchase. Because they have avoided mining a significant amount of materials from the earth and conserved copper, zinc, and many metals used for manufacturing a charging adapter, this decision by the technology giant had caused a furore among buyers. Another pivotal aspect of this argument is that people use lots of fossil fuels for their everyday work, detrimental to the environment. Ċ In conclusion, according to the arguments mentioned above, I feel that to save our planet and secure our next generation, scientists, policymakers, social workers, and the government should take several steps to overcome the situation and make the world a better place."
10766,Young people these days tend to be less polite and respectful than in the past. Discuss the causes and give solutions.,"It is often seen that the young generation have a lack of moral values than past generations. This essay will discuss two major reasons behind this kind of nature and suggest some possible solutions to mitigate this issue. Ċ Lack of parental supervision is the main factor affecting the nature of young people. This is happening because unlike past, parents today are working around the clock and when they come back at home from work, they feel too exhausted they do not try to impart the moral values to their children. As a consequence, young people show less respect and are less polite to others. Furthermore, another culprit is the violent TV shows and computer games. To illustrate, due to lack of supervision, children are spending their most of the time on serials which might portray the bad activities of a superstar, and on the violent games such as Pub G. Moreover, by watching such shows, they also feel that it is perfectly all right to behave badly and arrogantly to others. So, these are the problems which are associated with such kind of behaviour of the younger population. Ċ Fortunately,Nevertheless, there are some potential solutions to eradicate these causes. Firstly, parents should spend time with their children to pass on some family values to ensure they behave better with society members. Secondly, parents should make some restrictions on watching violent television channels and playing games. For example, channels which are using vulgar language have to be restricted by parents to stop the youngsters behaving in the same manner. Ċ In conclusion, lacking politeness and respectfulness are the root causes which are found among the young generation. However, to address this, parents are the best teachers who are responsible for shaping the nature of their children to react politely toward others and also shows respect."
10767,"Some people believe that entertainers are paid too much and their impact on the society is negative, while others disagree and believe that they deserve the money they make because of their positive effect on others. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Entertainment is becoming a very important part of our lives. The significance that the entertainers are being paid too much has always been debatable. Although some people are of the opinion that individuals who entertain are paid a huge amount of money that has a negative impact on society, others are of the view that this has a positive impact on human beings. In this essay, I will be discussing both the views and state my opinion, that is the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Ċ To begin with, these days entertainment is playing a very essential role in the industry. Additionally, entertainers help in making the individuals happy by creating a positive atmosphere that helps the audience forget all their sadness and brings joy in their life. For instance, men after their long tiring day at work and women after completing all the household chores, sit and relax by watching programs such as cricket, TV series, movies etc that makes them feel calm and tension-free. As a result, celebrities deserve the price they are paid to make the audience satisfied. Ċ On the other hand, it is undeniable that jobs such as doctors, teachers, engineers and other community workers are paid less when compared to the amount the entertainers earn. Moreover, people who entertain also enjoy a comfortable and luxurious life. For example, doctors pursue their studies for almost 10 years to become professionals to save the life of society, which involves a lot of hard work but they are paid less. Subsequently, this has a negative effect on individuals. Ċ By way of conclusion, although there are many disadvantages for the celebrities to be paid more, the benefits outweigh them, in order to keep humankind happy and cheerful."
10768,"With internet improvements, people can share views or opinions on certain goods or services that they have purchased. Ċ Is this a good or a bad thing? Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.","By the advance of technology,and the invention of the internet people can freely share their point of views about specific products and services which they have received and paid for which can be considered as a positive development.In this essay, I will discuss both advantages and disadvantages of such an improvement. Ċ On one hand,the internet has positive effects on the way consumers can express their opinion about certain goods or repairing services given from each brand or company.This can provide a source of information which will lead other consumers to make better decisions about what they have a plan to buy, by reading reviews within a few clicks.For example,when a person decides to buy an electronic device ,whether online or in the store,beforehand he can search the intended products’ brand directly on the Google website and immediately can read recommendations of people who have had and then if they were mostly affirmative ,it would be logical to buy.In my opinion, such technology-related developments aid us to enjoy a better quality of life due to a wide variety of information can be gained from it. Ċ On the other hand,as an increasing number of people have access to the internet, lots of data found there might not be valid.This unreliability might be not only due to bad intention but also variations of different people’s taste.Firstly,some people might leave comments about a specific product or service while they have never purchased it.They do such false data because of their bad intentions or personal animosity.secondly all buyers do not expect the same things from what they want to buy,therefore others’ opinion Might not be useful for them. For instance,People might have different taste in colours,designs and this can vary their expectations of goods from one to another so negative comments in such things should not be taken into account . Ċ To conclude,it is undeniable that the evolution of the internet has helpt people to express their ideas about what they pay for,such as goods and maintenance services.Even though this freedom in sharing views might not be beneficial sometimes,I believe that this is a positive development and make the decision making easier for people."
10769,"Ielts writing task 2 - Aging population I have tried to improve some mistake from the last work. Hope you guys can give me advice for this piece of writing Some people believe that aging population is good for business, the economy and society. Others, however, disagree with this view. Discuss both view and give your opinion.","These days, the percentage of older people in the population structure has been increasing rapidly. This trend leads to both positive and negative effects that will be discussed in this essay. Ċ On the one hand, the aging population brings about numerous advantages, economically and socially. First of all, senior workers have loads of practical skills and experience, which can be passed on to their counterparts. Take the teacher as an example; a senior teacher with a long time working has more experience in dealing with problematic children and the teaching method. Moreover, in a diverse working environment, the collaboration between the young and old helps improve productivity, increasing profits, and boosting economic growth. When it comes to the social aspect, older people are more likely to attend community service projects and voluntary activities, such as the local environment campaign. Ċ On the other hand, it is believed that the aging population somewhat can prevent the nation's development. Older workers tend to be less creative and innovative than younger colleagues. They often find difficulties keeping up with the latest technology, which impacts companies' productivity adversely. One more problem is the higher proportion of aging working people, the higher the unemployment rates. The youth have little chance to have a well-paid job when many jobs are full-filled by senior workers. For this reason, a large number of young people are forced to be unemployed and take a low-paying job that is below their abilities. Ċ In conclusion, regardless of some drawbacks, In my opinion, the advantages of the aging population outweigh the disadvantages, and there are various ways to take advantage of the older population to gain benefits for the society."
10770,Individuals can do nothing to change society. Any new developments can only be brought about by governments and large institutions. How far do you agree or disagree?,"In the past history, a large number of changes and developments were brought about by big organizations, governments, and institutions. These actions led many people to believe that individuals are incapable of becoming agent of change among society . I believe that both individuals and governments have their own function to bring influences or changes to society. Ċ First, looking back to history were almost most important matters solved by the organizations, governments, and institutions. In my opinion, it is understandable and natural due to they have great power to make policy or decision. For instance, when Indonesia was under the leadership of former President Soeharto, there was a large number of changes and developments especially economic development. He divided this economic development into three periods: economic recovery, rapid economic growth and increasing government intervention, export-led growth, and deregulation. Indeed, the economy grew rapidly and brought some improvements in its social development. Unfortunately, due to his dictatorial and authoritarian power, there were many people have become powerless, frustrated, and less respect to the government. Ċ On the other hand, a revolution started by minor or poor people who were recognized to be powerless. For instance, many student activists among universities in Indonesia united to protect and ask for Soeharto resignation.  The latest example is story about a young schoolgirl from Pakistan who stood up to the Taliban, Malala Yousafzai. She was shot in the head by Taliban due to her struggle against them to defend her right to an education. Ċ In conclusion, I do not think that individuals are incapable of bringing influences and create changes among society. I personally believe that individuals, like governments and organizations, are also part of society. Therefore, both individuals and governments or organizations can do something to change society in their own role."
10771,Your city has decided to build a statue or monument to honor a famous person in your country. Who would you choose? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.,"Many famous people have been living in my country who all of them possess their own great characteristics. In my point of view, one of the most honorable persons which were living in my city is professor. Mahmud Hesabi that I think his statue should be built in my city. Prof. Hesabi was not only a famous scientist in my country but also he had eminent personality with great beliefs. Indeed, this person is one of the best epitomes for all people in their life. As far as I'm concerned, here I enumerate some of my reasons for this choice. Ċ Professor Hesabi was the greatest physicist in my country who was teaching the quantum physics in Tehran University, the best university of my country, and he was famous as the father of physics science in Iran. He was one of the best students of Professor. Albert Aniston and afterwards he trained many eminent professors in this field. Ċ Additionally, as I said above he had great thinking near his teaching. He believed in many ethical principles in live and always was teaching these worthwhile beliefs to his students. Today, his valuable statements are followed by many students and other people. Ċ Moreover, Prof. Hesabi put many efforts out to improve the graduation status in my country. For example, he was cause to build new buildings and laboratories in universities, and increase the amenities for sending students to abroad for reaching more knowledge and technology. In result, all of these activities lead to remarkable progression in science and technology in my country.

Hesabi, because of his great characters both as a scientist and as an open-minded personality, will be the best choice."
10772,"Many different countries have most shops and products as the same. Some consider it a positive development, whereas others consider it negative. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Without any doubt, it has become evident that society is divided into two groups as per the distinct mindset of different people. Therefore, this has become a debatable issue whether the effects of globalization such as the same products and shops are detrimental or undeniably beneficial. This essay will shed light on these stated perceptions and discuss my point of view in conclusion. Ċ On the one hand, owing to the availability of different stock in terms of varieties as compared to the past, the reach of the common public has increased. This is to say when ordering from abroad, only wealthy families were able to buy imported things because they were sufficiently capable of paying the extra charges incurred in terms of shipping and tax. Apart from this, import and export business has dwelled between countries, thus, making the economy of involved nations prosper in a positive direction. For example, a report published by the “Economic and Finance Department” cited that the export-import business helped the economy of India to boost by 7% after the great recession period occurred in 2007. Moreover, it also stated that this booming economy created 45% more job opportunities which further helped it to rise. Ċ On the other hand, globalization caused local vendors serious problems. To simply this, the society took less interest in local brands in contrast to the merchandise from foreign companies, thus, due to the continuously diminishing popularity of native items, lots of shops got closed and people went jobless. To cite an example, a survey conducted by the “Employment and Grievance Department” in 2018 in India reported that approximately 4 out of 10 people’s had lost their work due to more inclination towards western produce. Ċ In conclusion, according to my perspective, it has widened the reach of the community as well as helped the economic segment of a country to boom."
10773,The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"These days, there is an ever-growing number of product manufacture that brings about environmental problems. In this essay, both causes and feasible solutions will be analyzed. Ċ Consumer goods are attributed to various factors. One main cause of this issue is that the factories would release toxic wastes into the air due to their production materials such as plastic or chemical emissions from the manufacturing process. Thus, the contamination could invade our nature and health visibly. Furthermore, some disposable goods become one of the most indispensable reasons leading to the living habitat threats because they are often made from long-term decomposing materials which have no way to completely deal with. Therefore, when utilized products are dumped into land or ocean, resulting in the deaths of many marine and terrestrial animals. Ċ There are a number of viable solutions to help tackle this problem. To begin with, governments should encourage the citizen to the 3R action (reduce, reuse and recycle) since it could be in the cable of minimizing the released wastes for the environment. In addition, companies and factories had better not utilize the chemical by-products or chemical emissions in their manufacturing process like bamboo and paper in order to prevent out life from negative impacts. Moreover, actions must be taken as soon as possible by decreasing the use of the unalternative and unreusable materials, instead, we could apply eco-friendlier facilities on our accommodation for the fresh green atmosphere. Ċ In conclusion, there are main contributors to the problem and several measures are suggested to put an end to the situation."
10774,Topic：Many deseases can now be prevented through the immunization and the governments make law to force people ger immunized. Should people be made by law to get immunized?,"Recent years, many diseases have broken out and spread around the world. Because of this, governments of different countries have to force people to get immunized and even make law that people should obey. In my opinion, I think it is acceptable that the government immunizes people compulsively for the following reasons. Ċ First of all, no one can deny that the governments are protecting the interest of the public. Immunizing people can decrease the infection and the probability of people getting ill can be lower. Besides, government wants to disroot the virus so that no more people will suffer from the sick feeling given by the illness. The most important thing is that government tries to prevent people from being carelessly infected with the virus and people from a lower class can also get immunized because the government covers the expense. These people don't need to worry about the cost. If everyone gets immunized, the virus can be destroyed effectively. Ċ On the other hand, many people worry about the by-effects of the immunization, especially the negative reactions afterwards. But there is no need to worry, because government must have considered the negative reactions that may occur to a small number of people after the immunization. What's more, scientists and doctors must have precautions before the public take the immunization, so the probability of by-effects is low. Also, if the person has these harmful reactions, government will be responsible for it. Ċ Obviously, as long as the safety of the immunization is ensured, more and more people will obey the law to get immunized."
10775,"Pollution of air, water and soil has become critical serious in last years and it takes millions of years to recoup. What are the main causes of pollution? Ċ How can we tackle this problem individually and globally?","In recent years, there has been a drastic rise in the pollution of the atmosphere, water and land leading to an overall impact on our planet that might take millions of years to restore. This essay will present the main causes and a few solutions to overcome this challenge on an individual and global level. Ċ To commence with, one of the major causes that contributes towards our air, water and soil contamination is the waste disposal of manufacturing factories along with the harmful gases emitted from them. These gases pollute the air leading to air pollution. Similarly, the harmful chemical waste disposed of these enter into the water bodies contaminating the water that is utilized by both humans and animals. In addition, improper dumping of garbage in random places instead of landfills and recycling centres lead to polluting the ocean, rivers and agricultural lands. Ċ However, there are a few solutions to tackle these concerns. Firstly, proper dumping of trash and garbage into the landfills and processing centres prevents them from entering the run-off water and impacts the soil fertility, resulting in erosion. This practice also helps in the prevention of contamination of our water cycle. Furthermore, we can opt for public transport to mitigate the pollution of our air. In terms of global efforts, the government of various countries should replace unsustainable resources like fossil fuels and replace them with renewable sources of energy, such as solar, wind and hydroelectricity to reduce the pollutants in the air caused due to these emissions. Moreover, they should impose certain strict laws to encourage reprocessing in our society. Ċ In conclusion, the main causes for all the three kinds of pollution appear to be the result of our negligence, hence, it is vital for us to put necessary efforts to sustain our planet and safeguard it by taking measures, including opting for public transport and following reprocessing methods diligently along with the global measures like introducing laws and encouraging sustainable sources of energy."
10776,"Nowadays it is easy to apply for and be given a credit card. However, some people experience problems when they are not be able to pay their debts back. Ċ In your opinion, do the advantages of credit cards outweigh the disadvantages?","The credit card is a ubiquitous advantage of the banking sector of the modern community in these days and it is a peace of cake to get it for an individual, who works in any field on a decent amount of pay. Sometimes it becomes a real hurdle for a person to repay the overly used money, but we cannot count it as a drawback of the card because it depends on a user. In my opinion, these cards are superbly helpful for someone in need, so advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages. The essay will discuss both facets of a proposal with appropriate examples and reaches to a logical conclusion. Ċ To begin with, the term of credit card started by the banking sector in all countries to support people with an extra money. Moreover, the bank issues a it after checking applicant's debt history and financial well being that does mean that applicant is eligible to repay their debt. Additionally, when we urgently need money in case of an emergency, so it helps us to pay our bills while the user is unable to work and manage their expenses. For example, in Australia, if someone may have an accident and not have any savings to pay their rent or bills, so they use it. Ċ Furthermore, on the other hand, some people think that it is a significant issue to pay their debt but it is depend their usage. However, people who do not know the purpose of it using their cards excessively, and then struggle to repay. Even though we know that excess of everything is bad, same as this overuse of an amount is horrible for person's debt history. For instance, some banks, give a period of repayment, if someone fails to make the payment could have an adverse impact on their financial profile. Ċ In conclusion, I think that credit cards have more advantages than disadvantages and these are an integral part of the banking to support people while their hard time, therefore people's usage reflect its effect on individual's life, nevertheless, it has too many benefits than side effects."
10777,Some people believe that individuals who earn a lot of money are the most successful. Others say that the individuals who contribute to the society (such as scientists or teachers) are the most successful. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Ċ Write at least 250 words.,"Being successful has always been the main motivation to move forward for humans. Also, it has always been a debate if whether the concept is defined by the amount of money someone makes or the impact that somebody might have on others by contributing to the community. In this ,essay a closer look at this topic will help in understanding different sides. Ċ Earning money would certainly be a result of various factors such as hardworking and discipline in existence within another essential characteristic. So, it is likely when someone starts receiving a considerable wage, years of experience and talent play a role behind that amount of money besides, it demonstrates responsibility. All those mentioned features shape successes as they should be achieved and maintained through an assemblage of different pieces rather than accident. to sum up, making huge profits equally means providing your exclusive needs as well as, in some cases helping others too. For this being wealthy is known to be fruitful and fortunate . Ċ Clearly, not everybody in society interprets prosperity in a materialistic way instead, they value flourishing through selfless serving to the public. Take educational tutors and teachers, devoting their life, to nurture their students to be the best of themselves as an example. In this case, the priceless action makes effective. Similarly, scientists accomplish their time in the same manner as their invaluable work and discoveries improve the quality of life and serve all sorts of people whether it is saving someone or finding an answer to a question. Ċ In conclusion, in my view, being successful derives from the most intimate contemplation and state of meaning and it has diverged from each soul. Additionally, it is deeply rooted in ambitions and desires therefore, it can not include a general explanation to operate for all classes of the public."
10778,Many people today are choosing to travel to other countries. Ċ Why is this happening? Ċ Is this a positive or negative development?,"It has become progressively common for the general populace to travel worldwide. In my opinion, the key catalyst for this positive development is a rise in middle-class income and advances in aviation. Ċ The most frequently cited rationale for people opting to visit foreign countries is the convenience of travelling. This argument rests on the fact that over the last century, we have experienced a concomitant increase in wages of companies and the global middle-class. For example, this can be most apparently seen in myriad working-class employees with disposable income, who are now able to go on holiday in different countries at least once or twice a year. Furthermore, thanks to cheaper airfares, which have complemented this reform and consequently, individuals nowadays are not afraid to fly. Thus, the accumulated evidence has reasoned why increasing numbers of the citizenry can afford international travel. Ċ Conceding the cause for this notion, I would contend that the ability to travel outside the homeland brings in several opportunities. This is predicated on the assumption that most of our former generation in the past lived and died to where they were born and lacked broad knowledge of the world. For instance, contrary to this is a salient illustration in youths, who now can effortlessly understand the world around them and set foot in numerous global attractions like the Louvre Museum and the Old Trafford Stadium. Moreover, with the advent of commercial flights and widespread coverage of social media, the youngsters can access a tremendous amount of information about airlines, accommodation, where to eat and what to do while on holiday. Therefore, being able to visit new destinations other than the home country confers a valid standpoint as we have witnessed the positive and tangible impact on the young generation. Ċ In conclusion, international travel is a sign of improved prosperity of a nation and we should be grateful for its contribution. In my final thought, governors and aviation regulators should propose a more holistic approach in order to prevent any potential threats to the environment due to an excessive amount of travelling internationally."
10779,How to improve public transport? Some people think that the best way to reduce the number of traffic jams is to improve public transport.How could public transport be improved and to what extent do you agree or disagree with those people?,"Many people believe that the ultimate solution to minimise the number of traffic jams is to enhance vehicles communally. In my opinion, I agree with that because of many reasons. Ċ Frist and foremost, The spaces of the road are opened by improving public wheels, for example, one bus's size equal six motorbikes size but the bus can take 45 people however the motorbikes just can take 12 people. The amounts of traffic congestions are lessened by expanding blank of the street. Besides that, the society is developed by boost mutual transits due to we will talk more when we are on the buses, trains, and planes. Ċ Second of all, the air pollution is decreased by update communal transport by cause of reducing exhaust gas. We will have a better life because we can breathe in fresh air. Many people, who don't have enough money to buy personal transportation, are helped by modern public transport, which will be improved. We will be safer by using urban vehicles because they run slower and more careful. Ċ Finally, The way some country update their communal transport is not good, for example, in Viet Nam, we decided to build the subway in HCM city to solve traffic jams but I don't think it can help us because it so late to develop subway system in 21 century. We have to update our public transport by the right way because it will waste a lot of money to build something can't be used for all. Ċ To sum up, I think to improve public transport is the best way to solve traffic jams because we have more blank in roads, the better society, and the better emotionally."
10780,"Topic: Nowadays, there is a trend that woman want to get married late or some even choose to live alone. Discuss both advantages and disadvantages of this trend. GETTING MARRIED LATE? SHOULD OR NOT?","Recently, woman doesn't want to get married early or some even decide to be a celibate is becoming more and more popular. There is no doubt that this trend has its own benefits and drawbacks. Ċ It's obviously thatgetting married late or living alone has some advantages. First of all, woman can feel more comfortable, independent and focus on her career. This means she will not be tied up with family, relatives and children, so she can spend more time concentrating whole-heartedly on her occupation. Therefore, she will be in control of her finance and life. Another benefit is that the proportion of divorce as well as the evils of family violence will be decreased. The majority of the divorced is result from not understanding the partner and don't integrate with married life. If getting married late, woman will have more time to comprehend her companion and realize who is right man for her. Ċ On the contrary, there are some disadvantages of this tendency. First and foremost, in Vietnam, the traditional customs still have a strong influence on the thinking of parents, so they will worry and create pressure on their daughter when she married late, which makes her faded and bored. For instance, my sister is 27 year-old and has steady job but not married, so her parents feel anxious and find a lot men to matchmaking for her regardless of her hostility. In addition, choosing celibacy will lead to the population reduction as well as gender imbalance. If a woman decides to live alone, the rate of marriage and childbearing will flop in significant way. Ċ In conclusion, getting married late or choosing to live alone in woman has above positive and negative aspects. Hence, we should consider in each situation to make a right decision."
10781,"Some people like to try new things, for example, places to visit and types of food. Other people prefer to keep doing things they are familiar with. Discuss both these attitudes and give your own opinion.","There are many individuals preferring to experience and discover new things such as places to visit and food, while others would like to keep them as is and stay in familiar circumstances. I support the first group of peoples' attitude because it brings a positive approach to life in general. Ċ To begin with, the majority of us like discovering new countries with their culture, cuisine and even style of living as it provides more emotions, positive way to various situations and sometimes it assists generating new ideas. For example, my brother, an engineer, after returning a trip all times invents some efficient electrical things . He says that those emotions he received while travelling support and inspire him to new actions and ideas. Therefore, I believe that experiencing new activities help individuals for broadening their horizons and change the way they live. Ċ However, those people who continue doing the same things have relevant reasons for that. For instance, they might be afraid of being disappointed. Probably, a person has or know an unsuccessful experience that makes him or her scared to try new stuff. And now this individual prefers to stay in familiar circumstances and do affairs for confidence. I personally consider this behaviour as missing opportunities and chances to find new ways of interesting and saturated life. Without discovering and trying new stuff living turns into a routine and becomes boring. Ċ In conclusion, many people support active and full of adventures life as it maintains a positive attitude and inspires to new ideas. I totally agree with such type of lifestyle, whilst others keep being in familiar situations to avoid disappointment, and thus, deprive themselves of chances to improve their existence for the better."
10782,"Topic: ""In many countries today, increasing numbers of young people studt at univesity. Students, who will probably earn higher than average salaries after graduating should pay for their own higher education, rather than state. What are your views?""","The concept that students should pay for their education is gaining popularity as more young people opt to go to universities. Although I have some sympathy with this idea, I believe that state funding is good investment for the future, not only for the students themselves, but for the students who can afford it should make some contribution to their university fees. Ċ Firstly, there are young people who cannot afford higher education but are very ambitious and talented. Instead of entering universities they begin working and the talents are wasted. Funding them is a good Idea as it brings equality to people and have a opportunity to study in universities irrespectively of their financial state. Ċ Secondly, student who have the financial state that grant them to pay for the fees, it should be obligatory for them to contribute for it as provides an opportunity for those who cannot afford it and be funded by state. This idea would provide more people with a higher deegre who have the professional skills that would not only be beneficial for them but for the counties development as well and boost the different field of jobs that are in failure. Ċ In conclusion, it is obvious that not all young people who plan to enter universities cannot afford their education, funding them is beneficial to individuals and brings a social quality. Under this conditions the country the country would flourish and even number of crimes will decrease as more people will be engaged by their jobs and studies."
10783,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,"There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion. Ċ To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents. Ċ Second, Using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal. Ċ Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal."
10784,"Today, the younger and older generations are in the same workplace. Is this more an advantage or more disadvantage?","Seeing young generations sharing the same working environment with the older ones have become more common these days. This essay will argue that such development brings huge advantages to the workplace. Ċ The increase in productivity is the prime reason to let people from different generations work together. While the creativity of the young blows new air to any business projects, the rich experiences of older workers help solve any problems or difficulties occurred. Their coordination, therefore, will significantly reduce the time required to finish the company's project while maintaining a high level of product quality. For example, thanks to the cooperation of the senior and the junior workers in the software department, my company has successfully delivered the final product to our customer two weeks before the deadline. Ċ Moreover, the co-existence of workers of different ages will make the atmosphere in the office less boring and dull. Many people admit that they tend to avoid conversations with their colleagues in the same age group because the topics to discuss quickly runs out. This tendency will eventually turn an active and lively office into a silent retirement home where no one talks unless it is about work. Hence, a multigenerational office will be able to promote communication between co-workers as there are always things to talk about. For instance, junior workers can share their modern lifestyles while the seniors can remind the young generation of how peaceful and tranquil life was in the past, and the list of topics goes on. Ċ In conclusion, putting workers of different ages together is definitely beneficial to any office as this development improves productivity and working atmosphere."
10785,Parents with undisciplined children should be made to follow compulsory 'parenting skills' classes where they can learn from professional teachers how to be a good parents. Do the advantages of this approach outweigh the disadvantages?,"Some people believe that parents of trouble-maker kids should be taught 'parenting skills' from professional educator in hope that this would reduce the number of undisciplined children in a society. The advantages and disadvantages of this method will be discussed thoroughly in this essay. Ċ The main benefit of this approach is that it allows the government to fix the issue from its root of problem. To be exact, parents are child's first exposure to the outside world, therefore, it is believed that parents with good attitude will pass them to their children. As a result, children with responsible and disciplined parents will be most likely to grow into a disciplined adult and vice versa. Ċ That said, undoubtedly there is also drawback to this solution. One important disadvantage is that this solution does not address the problem since there are many contributors that causes a child to be undisciplined. The attitude of their parents is only one of them, along with bad media, culture and friend influences. Therefore, forcing parents of undisciplined child to take up 'parenting skills' classes would only waste the government resources and money and not solve the problem. Ċ In conclusion, the advantage and disadvantage of this approach are equally important and that the government should investigate the matter more deeply before deciding on a solution. One possible solution could be to make undisciplined child to take up 'disciplinary classes' instead of 'parenting skills' classes for their parents."
10786,Some governments spend a lot of public money training individuals to be successful in international sporting events. Some people believe that this money should be spent on things that will benefit the general public instead. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, there has commonly been a huge amount of debate regarding this matter, a certain segment of society assumes that governments are wasting their money to organize sporting tournaments while some individuals think contrary. I fully agree that the general folk’s needs are more vital than sporting events. This essay will elucidate my views considering this trend as an adverse advancement for the community. Ċ Firstly, to train an elite athlete, authorities hire world-class fitness trainers as well as coaches, moreover, they build various expensive playgrounds and luxury building for the players. To cite an instance, a survey was conducted was by the Discovery channel states that the U.S.A spent 50 million dollars in the last Olympic games to provide special training for their players. In addition to that, another 10 million also spent to reward players who won medals. This wealth could be used for feeding poor persons or building shelters for the homeless crowd, and there are a plethora of individuals in the nation who are unable to feed their tummy. Ċ Secondly, sometimes these sporting events can cause tension between the two countries due to the fact that everyone desire’s that their country’s team should be the winner of the game. To illustrate that, when there is a cricket match India vs Pakistan then the situation between these two nations gets very dangerous. Furthermore, residents of these nations start posting bad content on social media which clearly make the situation worse. Same story we can see when the FIFA football cup starts. Ċ To conclude, in my perspective, spend a country’s assets on few players is not a wise thing because our priority should be to reduce the poverty but this trend swift the rate of poverty in undeveloped nations."
10787,"Nowadays some professionals such as doctors, lawyers and engineers are paid much higher than ordinary workers. What do you think of this trend? Are there any jobs which you think should offer higher salaries?","Recently, some experts remuneration such as health professionals,lawyers and engineers, outweighs other professions. These are high earned vocation that works in detail, they pay a lot in schooling ranging from school fees, textbooks, handouts etc. In my opinion, these avocations should be reimbursed more than any other career options. Reasons will be explained herein. Ċ To begin with, people refer to these adepts as ""career for life"" because you can either choose to practice privately or work in organizations or companies. For example, being a medical doctor has helped me a lot in several ways that I would have imagined. Patients entrust their lives into my hands because they believe I am capable to cure and heal them of their burdens and diseases, they see doctors as gods who can do and undo things, I will go the extra mile to make sure nothing happens to them. Sometimes when things go wrong, doctors suffer the most ;they are blamed for a patient's death because they have this notion they have been mismanaged or used as drug experiments. we go through and face a lot in the course of practice. More so, the salaries health professionals receive should compensate for the kind of jobs they do. Ċ Furthermore, a lot of people go into these occupations because there are better job opportunities in comparison to others like performing art. Due to the risk and job intensity, there are flexible and good payment plans associated too. For example, my cousin is an engineer who works in an oil firm, his job involves him staying in the ship on a sea for 2 weeks before they sail to the chore, this is very in-depth. He has to be paid to compensate for the risk he goes through each time he goes to work, compared to a front desk worker who only sits from morning till when he/she closes and goes home. Ċ To conclude, professionals like doctors, nurses, lawyers and engineers should be recompensed handsomely compared to other professions."
10788,Employers should give longer holidays to employees to encourage them to do their job. Do you agree or disagree?,"One of the most conspicuous trends of today's world is a colossal upsurge in the number of people believing that by giving longer holidays to employees to encourage them to do their task efficiently. There is a widespread worry and this will lead to a myriad of concerns in one's life. However, I do not entirely accept this and I will explain in this essay. Ċ There are a number of arguments in favour of my stance. The most preponderant one is that work pressure, due to tough competition and tight deadlines in corporate sector. Therefore, they have to do job in late nights and the employees do not have enough time to unwind and feel relax. Moreover, there is a rat-race between colleagues for the office promotions. Needless to say, if employers allow them a break for some time, it is good for their health as well as they feel more energetic, and they can focus on the assigned task by which the chances of company growth will increase. For example, the CEO of Microsoft company limits the working hours and they saw the progress of their worker improved within a few months. As a result, there yearly turnover is increased by 25%, said Google. Ċ There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overwhelm the potential benefits of longer holidays. The primary one stems from the fact that by observing the aforementioned trend, people have not realized its gravity, but also gauged the magnitude of its repercussion when it comes to today's ever-changing lifestyle. Besides, its impact on the economy of the country is far-reaching indeed. Hence, it is apparent why many are against allowing the job half-term. Ċ To summarize the arguments outlined above, one can conclude that despite some drawbacks the benefit of the holidays is indeed too great to ignore. Because, the workers feel happy and courageous by having a rest from their work."
10789,"Topic: Some people strongly oppose animal experimentation, believing that it causes pain to animals, while some other people consider it necessary. What is your opinion?","People hold different views towards the necessity and humane feature of current animal testing. In my opinion, both human and animals are capable of deriving enormous benefits from this sort of experimentation and thereby, it is suggested to be enhanced. Ċ To begin with, the advantages of vivisection to human are most prominent in the field of medicine and education. For instance, various types of animals such as pigs and mice have been significantly used in testing new kinds of drugs by dint of possessing similar biological features to those of human. Some drug prototypes are theoretically effective but whether there are any side effects in reality is rather unknown. In these cases, the use of animals in checking pharmaceuticals is essential prior to applying in persons. Additionally, many animal-based researches have been conducted inside educational institutions have provided new insights into the evolution of animals. Briefly, animal testing helps to advance our medical and scientific knowledge. Ċ Equally importantly is that, animal testing are beneficial to wildlife species for many reasons. Firstly, by carrying out genetic experiments do scientists potentially offer some solutions for the endangered species. It is true that a wide variety of animals are on the verge of extinction owing to the loss of natural habitats or increasing pollutants. With the results of animal research, this issue will probably be tackled. Furthermore, examining ethology will provide an outlet for controlling some species in particular patterns. For example, nowadays it is applicable to increase the likelihood of animal survival in natural environment. Accordingly, animal experimentation has a positive impact on animals themselves. Ċ To sum up, animal testing plays a significant role in the well-being of both human beings and animals. Therefore, animal vivisection should continue rather than being suppressed in the future."
10790,[TPO7] Essay Topic Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"Although many people believe facts have more practical effects than abstract words, I think ideas and concepts have more potential force that will affect our whole life. In my opinion, the value of understanding ideas and concepts is higher than learning facts. Ċ The first reason is ideas and concepts are difficult to grasp. Unlike facts, we can find it out by continuously testing. On the contrary, ideas are hard to perceive, because ideas usually contains more range of knowledge and develops for a long time. Therefore, understanding ideas and concepts will increase our competitiveness. Ċ Second, ideas and concepts are usually created by outstanding persons. Those people dedicate their whole life to specific areas and in the end they left all their efforts in their words. Those words are the ideas and concepts we learn now. Thus, learning ideas is not just learning it, but learn from those great persons. Ċ The third reason is we will benefit a lot by understanding just one idea or concept. For example, there are too many stories describing how a person succeed by being motivated by one idea or concept. Merely only one idea will create huge powers that we cannot even imagine. Hence, we will gain more by grasping relatively small amounts of ideas. Ċ In conclusion, we do nothing without any fact; nonetheless, if we want to achieve something great, then merely holding facts is absolutely not enough. We need the help from ideas, concepts, and those brilliant people."
10791,Question : Some people argue that strict punishment for driving offenses is the only effective way toward improving safety on the road. Do you agree or disagree? Road safety improving,"Nowadays, increasing number of Traffic accidents is a growing concern in developing and developed nations. While some opine that strict actions should be imposed on the offenders who violates traffic norms is the most efficient way to reduce road accidents. I agree that strict rules should be implemented for the road safety Ċ The first and foremost benefit for imposing harsh punishments on violating traffic laws is that it will Inculcate discipline and responsible among citizens. In addition, People will always think twice before breaking the traffic laws, otherwise they have to deal with hefty fines and imprisonment. To illustrate, in Singapore, traffic accidents were reduced exponentially after their government taken action against traffic law breakers. Ċ Secondly, safe driving will help to reduce financial overheads on the state. This is because less number of accidents will result in reduction in damages to public properties, thus authority will have to pay less for infrastructure fixation. Moreover, Insurance companies will have to settle fewer number of claims related to accidents, so in longer run, their premium will reduce considerably which in turn will benefit the individuals. Ċ However, some people may argue that instead of implementing strict punishment, state should increase awareness about traffic rules among vehicle drivers by providing informative sessions and advertisements which will have same impact as with harsh traffic guidelines. What is more, heavy penalty on drivers may become burden on individuals. Therefore, traffic educations should be considered as an important aspect to minimize fatalities. Ċ In conclusion, although motivating people about following road safety rules can reduce accident risk, harsh punishment will force the people to follow traffic regulations in more effective way"
10792,Today more people are overweight than ever before. What in your opinion are the primary causes of this? What are the main effects of this epidemic?,"Obesity is rapidly becoming a stigma in our society today. This essay will discuss the reasons behind the increasing number of overweight people as well as analyse its impacts. Ċ In my opinion, the two major causes of obesity are over-consumption of fast food and lack of physical exercise. A large amount of people today, rely on fast foods, for their daily diet. These foods contain oils and saturated fats, which leads to slow metabolism rate and excessive weight gain. To cite an example, a survey conducted by WHO in 2015, found that 90% of obese citizens, solely depended on outside foods for their nutrition, which clearly depicts the contribution of quick foods for the growing cases of fatness. Secondly, the majority of adults nowadays, lead a sedentary lifestyle due to increasing facilities and changes in the work environment. For instance, everyone, now prefers taking elevators, instead of climbing stairs. Moreover, the work is becoming less demanding physically due to availability of machines. All the above changes, have taken to reduce the required physical activities for a human body, which has ultimately resulted in a huge obese population. Ċ The main effects of this trend, in my view, include increasing health problems and loss of productivity. Heftiness can lead to an array of cardiovascular diseases. In addition to this, diabetes and blood pressure are common problems among overweight people. In fact, a research conducted recently, has concluded that there is 65% more chance of developing diabetes for a fat person. Furthermore, obese workers are often very unhealthy, and hence, get stressed and tired easily. This decreases their efficiency. It has been observed that, an individual with normal weight works much faster, compared to an obese person. Ċ To conclude, the unhealthy eating habits and inactive lifestyles are the main reasons behind fatness which leads to severe health issues and low performance. Since, the consequences of these are highly destructible to mankind, steps need to be taken on individual as well as the government level to fight the problem."
10793,Some people think that the government should increase tax on unhealthy food to encourage people to start eating healthy. Do you agree or disagree?,"Needless to say that consumption of fast food adversely affecting the health of a human being. Some people claimed, it is essential to impose a high tax on junk foodstuff because it may discourage people from eating fast food. In my opinion, hefty charges can reduce the consumption rate but will not motivate them for nutritious food items, and I would explain some points which strengthen my viewpoint in the upcoming paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, imposing heavy levies on fast food means an increase in price on commodities which directly affect the middle class and poor people. To be more specific, junk food like burgers, pizzas and street foods available at affordable rates at various apps like zomato and swiggy. Consequently working people and students who live away from homes prefer junk food because they do not have enough time to prepare a meal. Eventually, if the government increase the tax on fast food, it will not affect the rich people they will continue to consume it. Ċ On the other hand, there some other methods through which this problem could be solved. First is, healthy foodstuff should be more affordable and accessible so that everyone, especially weaker section of the society can easily buy it and easily approachable for the working people. Because many people are aware of the ill effect of unhealthy eating habits but the availability of ready to eat food is comparatively more than healthy products. Moreover, the government ought to organize a health awareness campaign in different areas which give information not only about healthy and unhealthy food but also explain the harmful impacts of fast food. Ċ In conclusion, nonetheless imposing hefty charges on ready to eat meals minimize the consumption of unhealthy products, but it will deter low-income groups from buying them. Health fitness programme and the awareness of self-discipline towards the eating pattern could certainly reduce the consumption rate of junk foods."
10794,Now a lot of people in college are doing academic study. Ċ should encourage them lo learn vocational skill (like plumbers Ċ electricians). Do you agree or disagree?,"Majority of the people are acquiring academy schooling these days.Though attending college is mandatory, some people believe that students should be encouraged to gain some other mechanical artistry such as plumbers and electricians, however,I do not agree will the given statement.I will list down the reasons for my disagreement. Ċ Firstly, students spend their majority of life period after earning the educational institution degree going through a lot of hardships.Hence, there is no reason for asking them to learn other vocational skill other than their field, undervaluing their college training.Moreover, emergency situations are not often when an individual may need plumber or electrician, in case of needy time, at most of the places, one can find technical person easily.For instance, students at college are always busy learning new things of their own branch, if they are forced to learn new job not related to their field, it may be waste of time resulting in disappointment among students.As follows, college students should be encouraged to sharpen their accomplishment and increase the knowledge-oriented to their own line. Ċ Secondly, if college students will start leaning vocational skill then, the people who can not afford the university study and employed as a technical person, be it electrician or any other,they will also have fewer opportunities to work because people are already knowledgeable and can do technical work of their own.Thusly, the ratio of unemployment will rise causing more difficulties for the technical persons to earn a living.To illustrate,If an individual gets his fan damaged at home, and he has learnt how to repair fan, he will not call the electrician as it will save money and time both for him. Therefore, vocational skill is something, which is easily available to learn for poor people, and at least those skills, people should let to someone who can not afford the higher education. Ċ In conclusion, some people may see mechanical skills as necessary and may give the motivation to learn those skills to students pursuing the university discipline, nonetheless, I do not agree with this for the reasons, that it may let students feel underestimation of the university education, as well as lead to the employment of technical persons."
10795,"Too much attention is paid to and too much money is spent on keeping pets, while people throughout the world are starving. To what extent do you agree?","Some people argue that the attention and money spent on pets are a waste of money and this can be diverted to stop starvation in the third world countries. However, others believe that leading a luxurious life spending more on pets is a privilege of the well-off community. Considering the two aspects, I conclude that, both arguments carry the same amount of gravity. Ċ First of all, pets not only share life with people but also help the people, for instance, the life of the elderly living alone is safeguarded. Nowadays, pets are trained to guide their deaf or blind masters, to smell people to identify when they are sick or in danger and to provide safety in farmlands. In addition, in a broader perspective, animals are used in the police in order to catch the offenders. Similarly, they can be used to rescue those who are lost in the snow or deserts. Therefore pets are used successfully in both domestic and community based services. Ċ When the counter argument is taken into account, a huge sum of money is allocated for pets in bringing up, treatment and training purposes. It is worthwhile assessing to what extent it is ethical to keep people starved, reserving money for the maintenance of pets. It is not only the adults, but also the children are dying in significant numbers due to lack of money to spend on food. In addition, Poor immunity, lack of energy and poor working performance carry an extra burden to the existing problem. Based on these factors money can be re allocated to prevent starvation in developing countries. Ċ In conclusion, these arguments point out two different scenarios. Nevertheless, there should be a balance in spending and the excess money has to be kept for the benefit of the entire mankind."
10796,Should we invent a new language for people from different countries to use for international communication? Do you think there are more benefits or more problems with it?,"Today,the role of English as a global language is indispensable.Some people are of the view that we can introduce a new language for the people to use for international activities.Although this initiative may be a useful way to create new platform that facilitates universal cooperation,I believe it would raise a number of worrying issues. Ċ Admittedly,the availability of a global language can promote international trade and also create new possibilities for the cooperation between countries in other areas without language barriers.By using a common language,people are able to handle cross-cultural communication and build business partnerships. Besides,learning a new language is a effective way to promote individual competitiveness to adapt the present society quickly;thus,under this trend,people who have proficiency in this new language are more likely to find jobs,collect information and travel overseas. Ċ On the other hand, if the world has a dominant language, it may have a damaging effect on cultural diversity and cultural identity, especially for the ethnic minorities.Languages in these countries may suffer from extinction because people should learn it to keep the pace of life with a big burden,resulting to retrogression in their own language cultures.It should also be noted that this innovation would markedly increase the governmental expenditure on creating, publishing and teaching it, so maintaining the main position of English around the world is much more cost-efficient and effective than innovating a brand-new one. Ċ In conclusion, the enormous potential risks of innovating a single international language outweigh the benefits of it.Therefore,Persuading citizens to use existing global language proficiently assists us protecting some minority languages and cultural heritages."
10797,"Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Ċ Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. Ċ On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction. Ċ To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others."
10798,"some people believe that all companies decisions should be decided by the managers, while others view that its better to include employees in decision making. Ċ discuss both views and give your opinion.","In the present age, there has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether all decisions in companies should be taken by owners or employees can have a contribution to it. Some people argue that only the managers have this responsibility to decide about the important issues, while others assert that including the employees in decision making have some benefits. Personally, I am in favour of the latter view. Ċ On the one hand, some individuals think that the head of each organization is able to decide about different subjects because they care more than anyone else about their company situation. Furthermore, during the decision-making process, they analyze everything and finally choose a way that is the most beneficial for the network. In addition, usually, managers have more experience which is a vital factor. For instance, if a company face a financial problem, they can use both their experience and leadership skills to find a solution. Ċ On the other hand, others believe that there are many advantages to participating the workers to finding a way to solve the drawbacks. Moreover, they argue that using more minds leads to having more ideas. For example, if an organization face a problem, it will be better to have a meeting with all employees and discuss with them the causes and solutions. Consequently, they will find a way faster than when only the boss does it. Ċ To sum up, I would like to say that I totally agree with the statement that everyone in a company should have the right to express their opinions. From my perspective, there are more merits than demerits such as finding a route to solve and pass difficult situations."
10799,"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ The dangers of smoking are well known, yet many people continue with this habit. Ċ What are the causes of this? How can we reduce smoking in society? Ċ Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 250 words.","It is argued that fume ingestion has a plethora of adverse side effects. However, the overwhelming majority of individuals do not pluck up the costume. Many causes are appointed to this as well as communities are called to solve the issue. This essay will shed light on both causes and solutions as well as provide evidence to prove the arguments. Ċ There are manifold causes for the issue, first and foremost, genetic predisposition. In other words, numerous smokers inherited the habits from their ancestors. For instance, recent research from the University Zambeze carried out last year showcased that more than 60% of cigarette smokers got the tradition from their collateral and the parental gene was accountable for the fate. As a result, no matter what their post- generation does they will fall into smoking dependence. Moreover, these sorts of toxic dependence substances are the main reason for a myriad of fume dependences throughout the world. Ċ There are plenty of possible smoke solutions, which communities should adopt worldwide such as eliminating crop production across the earth. It will undoubtedly cut the chain distribution. For instance, the investigation made by the University of Cambridge pointed out that if the world tobacco production was shrunk only to half worldwide the earth would live without smokers in less than 2 years. Hence, lung diseases could reduce as well as they should soar individuals life's span. Ċ In conclusion, amongst fair motives for a crowd smoking genetical issue is the most pivotal and societies are urged to tackle this evil inside them and cutting the chain production has shown is the most effective measure. Therefore, I encourage the world-ruling power to tussle together to eradicate this problem."
10800,"Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Ċ Childhood obesity is becoming a problem throughout the developed world.Because of this, some people think that adverts for fast food, sweets and sugary snacks should not be allowed in schools and colleges. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?","It is hard to deny the fact that obesity has been dramatically increasing over the years among the children. Owing to this, it is believed by many people that fast meal ads should be banned from the schools and colleges. As far as I concerned, school and college are meant for education so adverts of healthy meal should be introduced. Ċ There is no doubt that fast food items, sweets and sugary snacks are one of the major reasons due to which adolescents have obesity. On the top of this, introducing advertisement on such items in institutes is really a big issue to be taken care of immediately. For instance, companies take the biggest advantage of the institutes to target youth in a large capacity, as it might hard for youngsters to avoid junk foodstuff when big posters are available in front of them. In addition, companies encourage the children to eat them in large groups as they always ready to give discount on order of large quantity. Moreover, many Colleges make money from these adverts by charging the companies a minimum fee. Ċ Although removing the food adds from the institute is very hard, it can be replaced by green vegetable adverts. However, it is very difficult to stop students from eating junk items, but they can be guided to eat green items. Having a cafeteria with healthy meal will result in some change among the students. For example, setting up healthy workshops for the students and by the students will also promote a healthy lifestyle. Listing of drawbacks on obesity and then sticking them to the walls of the schools will also create awareness. Ċ In Conclusion, I think it would be fair to change the junk snack advertisements with the healthy stuff. Furthermore, institutes should blacklist the companies with sweets and sugary snacks."
10801,"Present a written argument or case to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic: There are many different types of music in the world today. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays? Use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence. You should write at least 250 words.","Imagine our world without any entertainment which will exist in case we vanish tunes from our life. These sounds are the main bridge where education, history and culture travelled through every century from the beginning of humanity. Therefore, I believe that international melodies are more significant than traditional ones and they are considered essential tools for learning, healing and amusement. Ċ Presently, musical instruments are working an efficient role in many social facilities. In schools, teachers are using them to clarify difficult materials for students in a convenient way such as math courses which are recorded on musical audiotapes. Another benefit of music was discovered in hospitals where it helps patients to remain calm during and after surgeries. Finally, there are many pieces and performances that are dedicated to specific occasions like weddings, funerals and concerts. Ċ Secondly, our planet is developing at high speed with new technologies which are appearing every day, so there is no more place for traditional music. Young generations are seeking the modern trends in songs especially the one which scores a high rate of listening or views without any consideration of its originality or historical background. In addition to that, the widespread of social media such as Facebook, Youtube and Tiktok assist in the advertisement of recent singers. These artists aim to expand their audience worldwide, and they are not concentrating on the quality of their products. Ċ In conclusion, music is the principal incentive for all other occupations whatever it is educational or professional. As result, I hope that this domain will unite us as a human race known for its compassion and love."
10802,"Nowadays, people change their appearance by dying hair, buying fashionable clothes, wearing make-ups and even undergoing plastic surgery. What are the reasons? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?","Many people now place more importance on their appearances by coloring their hair, being fashionable, wearing make-up and even undergoing plastic surgery. This is down to the influences of the media and advertisement. In my view, this is a negative development. Ċ One of the factors influencing people to change their appearance is celebrity. People adore some famous personalities and thanks to the proliferation of internet, it makes even easier for people to access information about famous artist. They mostly have colored hair, put a heavy make-up and wear expensive clothes. Some celebrities, such as Korean, even undergo plastic surgery to gain more popularity. People as their fans want to look like them and therefore they follow their footsteps. Another impacting factor is advertisement. People are bombarded with many advertisements of cosmetic, fashion, and make up. This is unconsciously setting up a standard of beauty in their mind. As a result, they buy products to become the image of endorser in the ads. Ċ However, this is clearly a negative development. The image of beauty should not be influence by outside factor. All women are gorgeous as they already are with their natural hair color and without heavy make up. In Indonesia, a woman wearing a traditional costume with simple make up and black hair is considered as a natural beauty. Additionally, frequent heavy make-up could lead into various skin problems, namely pimple and skins breakout. Furthermore, plastic surgery needs a costly maintenance. If people could not afford it, then they will borrow some money and they could run up a debt. Ċ In conclusion, media reporting celebrities and advertisement are the reasons people change their look. However, make-up and plastic surgery potentially bring about many problems to many problems for this to be considered as positive development."
10803,"The number of old people is increasing in many countries. Some people think this causes problems, while others think old people play an important role. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The Twenty-one century has been all about increasing life expectancy. However, some economic consequences are starting to become a delicate concern in many countries. While there is a common belief that the growth of the ageing population is positive to society, many people believe the cost of maintaining them is reaching unbearable levels for the active workforce. I believe that governments should come up with some long-term alternatives for retirement schemes as the current ones are likely to collapse. Ċ The elderly play a vital role in both communities and families. For instance, they are the ones in charge of keeping traditions alive, either by passing on secret cooking recipes or writing the history books that children will learn from in the future. In addition, they play an important role inside the family's organization with many parents relying on them for babysitting. The COVID pandemic is a clear example of how much damage has been done to families to keep children and grandparents apart during such a prolonged time. In this way, the importance of elders in society is undeniable. Ċ On the other hand, there are several concerns regarding the economic and financial support of the elderly. The clearest example is the retirement schemes that are widespread around the world these days. In general, the active workforce is the one holding the cost of pensioners by paying taxes. As long as the ageing population keeps up the increasing tendency, there would not be enough resources to maintain them. If authorities do not come up with an alternative model, the whole economic system is might collapse. In addition, the health system´s capacity will also be compromised. It is well-known that the older a person is, the more health issues can arise. Therefore, current hospitals and clinics might not be enough to attend to everyone´s needs. Ċ To sum up, elderlies play an invaluable role in the community and families. However, governments should design new ways of funding retirements as only relying on the active working people can lead to a significant crisis."
10804,"Because the modern technology, it is no longer necessary for people to learn handwriting skill, but others believe that handwriting is still an important skill. Discuss both sides and give your opinion base on your experience.","Due to the modern technology, it is no longer required for people to learn a handwriting skill. However, others still believe that handwriting is an important ability to do different multifarious jobs. The proficiency of handwriting has been changed by computer keyboard which provide letters, and numbers. On the other hand, handwriting is extremely prominent in our daily life activity, and not only in the office, such as mothers at home or in a social gathering, students, and teachers at school. Ċ Nowadays computer has replaced handwriting for almost all kinds of job in office. For instance; typing letters, doing finance report, as well as making charts. In spite of it, not all financial statements can be undertaken by computer. Still, people need handwriting abilities to write a financial report. The major cause of this is if all accounting can be typed on computers, imposture can always happen.Whereas, if it is written in a book manually, later the one who meant to do the correction, he or she may not use correction pen, but cross out one line so that the auditor would be able to see if it is true or tricky. Ċ In contrast, the ability to have a good writing is still necessary in our daily life. For examples: parents at home, mothers in a social gathering, students, and teachers in class are required to write, whether on a paper, on blackboard or whiteboard, as well as in a book. Students who have bad handwriting might get some difficulties in a written test. A teacher or an examiner who has minus eyes will not be able to check the student's work properly. As a result, the student might get a bad score due to ugly handwriting. Ċ To come to a conclusion, in my opinion, although handwriting is substituted by computers, Nonetheless, handwriting skill will be required in any action, whether in office as well as in our daily life, for examples; in writing a financial report still better to use handwriting in order to prevent from camouflage statements. While in school, teachers and students must be able to have the ability of handwriting so that everything runs well."
10805,Some say that it is more important for employers to consider academic qualifications rather than personal life experience and values when hiring an employee. Do you agree or disagree? What are positive and negative aspects of the issue?,"Company's success partially depends on employees who work there. Hiring right person for right job position is one of the main factors affecting to company's future success. Therefore, companies should pay more attention on hiring an employee who is most suitable for the position. Selection process of hiring an employee depends on several candidate-related factors. Some people argue that an academic qualification of job candidate is more important than its personal life experience and values, while others oppose to this idea. In my point of view, both of views supportable because both of them have advantages and disadvantages. Ċ In many job position the academic knowledge person gained through his education is the fundament of his future working and pursuing knowledge. For example, software programmers usually work on coding to develop the right solution by planning most appropriate algorithm. This ability usually requires individuals to be good at computing and math. Therefore, programmer's capability depends heavily on his academic qualifications. Ċ On the other hand, however academic qualification of candidate is important, personal experience and values must be consider first for some kind of job position. For example, it could not be appropriate choice for teachers of kinder garden to require best academic qualifications regardless his personal experience. Teachers of kinder garden must be good carefulness with children. In my opinion, the person who has a personal life or previous work experience with children can work, care and educate children more carefully than one without any experience with child. Ċ In conclusion, academic qualification, personal experience and values of job candidate are main factors for making decision in hiring employee. Therefore, when hiring an employee, making decision based only one of these factors might be imperfect solution for some kind of job position."
10806,"Some think that residents should responsible for keeping thier areas clean and tidy, while others say it is the government’s responsibility. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.","It is important that we have to keep our surroundings clean and maintain hygiene in the life. A group of people believes that the government should take steps to maintain the area and another group argue that it is an individual's duty to clean the place. In my opinion, both the authority and individual should join and take efforts to maintain our areas. Ċ On the one hand, most of the garbages come from the houses and from the residential areas. Everyone should be aware about the impact of dumping in a public area without finding a suitable way to dump or recycle the garbage. Moreover, citizens can start segregating the waste and can accumulate it in a common area where the concern authority can come and collect the waste. For example, in Bangalore, most of the apartments segregate the waste and use bio-waste as manure for the plants. As a result of this, the environment is clean and it promoted the growth of the plants. Ċ On the other hand, the law enforcing agency can start awareness classes to the society about the collection and disposal. Additionally, they should arrange the facility to collect all the garbage from all the apartments and clean the public facilities daily. For instance, in Kerala, the authority has a group of women for handling the unwanted things from a family and they go and pick the plastics and papers from the roads, schools. This makes the city tidy and also act as a job for the women. Ċ In conclusion, maintaining a healthy life and a clean environment is the responsibility of both the individuals and the governments. By the joint effort and cooperation, we can make the environment green and pollution free."
10807,"Some people believe that having too many TV channels is good for people, while some other pole believe that it only brings some poor quality TV programs. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is argued that there are interesting purposes on the broadcast TV for individuals these days, meanwhile; others suppose that it is just the low-quality channels. This essay will discuss two viewpoints and I totally agree with the first one in the following paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, there is no doubt that it is easy to watch the uncensored contents for children, tending to imitate unsuitable actions. In other words, it is challenging with parents to steer their' children to watch and enjoy it. For instance, movies in which have several violent and sexual scenarios are more likely to create bad habits for adolescents by the time their consciousnesses are flaws. Their awareness, as a result, could develop in wrong ways which lead to worse generations in upcoming years. Ċ On the other hand, I would agree that watching Television programs has huge merit for almost all residents. In particular, it is likely to do not only widen their horizons but also help them keep up to date with breaking national and worldwide news. Taking the Covid-19 pandemic as an example. Thanks to this media, citizens could update about the danger of this virus through a significant increase in mortality rate around the world. People, therefore, are aimed to know how to protect themselves and their relatives in both physical and mental health from this disaster. Moreover, a TV program is one of the best ways for entertainment. People could release stress after daily high-pressure work by watching TV with their families. Ċ In the conclusion, both views inevitably have their supporting evidence. I quite believe that the effects of TV programs are useful among people."
10808,Many schools today require students to work without pay for companies as part of their education. Ċ Is this more advantageous to students or companies?,"Nowadays, several institutes have introduced an internship program in which students are required to work for a certain period without receiving any pay. This has a positive impact on students in various ways, such as gaining practical knowledge, as well as an insight of their future careers, and also an increased job opportunity. In this essay, we shall discuss the merits to it further. Ċ In the past few decades, the education system has tried to foment ways to enhance and improve children’s education and future. Moreover, internship programs are one of the advancement which has shown many benefits, for instance, it provides a different approach towards teaching system altogether, eventually serving as a platform to implement theories into practice. Furthermore, the atmosphere in jobs is different from the classroom environment, and hence these sessions provide an in-depth information about the possibilities encountered in the office. Lastly, programs like these not only help in developing knowledge, but as well in building-up the resume of the student. Additionally, it prepares them for the interviews, and notable requirements of certain employers. Ċ On the other hand, companies merely benefit through aforesaid programs. There is hardly any window of opportunity for them except that they receive employees for free. However, it acts as an investment, for example, companies have the liberty to select any potential student who shows any promising skill and talent. Overall, these points hardly match the benefits than the pupils receive through these programs. Ċ In conclusion, the merits received by students outweigh those of companies. In the end, knowledge is power; therefore, these additional programs not only gives the child intelligence, but experience as well that is equally beneficial for their future endeavours. Nevertheless, opportunities like these should be undertaken immediately."
10809,In many part of the world there is continuous coverage of sport on TV. Some people believe that this discourages the young from taking part in any sport themselves. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In recent years, lots of sport programs have appeared in some television channels over the world. This trend causes other people to think that the programs discourage teenagers to get involved in a sport themselves. Although these thoughts have different perspectives, I firmly argue that both opinions result in some effects to juveniles. Ċ It cannot be denied that a few television stations provide much information and news about sports so as to improve people knowledge. Kompas Sport, a sport series in Indonesia, shows audio-visual news not only about sport events which are in Indonesia, but also all around the world -international sport events-, for example. As a result, people (including the young) who watch the series will understand more about sports. All in all, sports become essential for them in the light of important information which is given by TV channels. Ċ On the other hand, many people strongly argue that sport series on screen discourage the young to join any sport themselves as they just watch the programs all the time. Taking World Cup, the biggest football competition in this planet, as an example, it is appeared on virtually TV channels and almost whole day, and it attracts much attention of many people widespread, especially young people. Therefore, they spend much time to watch the program and lack of time to get involved in a sport. To sum up, this can affect juveniles habit, sport in particular, every time. Ċ In conclusion, it is evident that the condition causes several affects (positive or negative) for young in spite of different views. It is imperative that teenagers should not only watch the program, but also take responsibility to practice the sport because they will not understand more, unless they exercise directly."
10810,Some people think the role of parents is to discipline their children and teach them about right and wrong. Other people consider that the main responsibility of parents is to nurture their children and provide them a Safe environment to grow up in. Discuss both sides and give your opinion?,"Some people believe that it is the responsibility of parents to teach the right values to their children, while others think that the main duty of parents is to provide children with a safe environment to grow up in. While teaching children the right values can teach them good behaviour, I believe that parenting children in a safe environment will help children to avoid negative behaviour. Ċ One the one hand, if children are taught the right discipline and values they tend to learn social behaviour. This is to say that children do not possess adequate knowledge about right and wrong behaviour and when kids are taught from a young age, they are more likely to behave well in their teenage. For example, a recent survey conducted by the American Bullying Association revealed that the kids who were taught moral values at home did not bully other kids in school. However, I believe that children’s age should also be taken into consideration while teaching them good behaviour. Ċ On the other hand, parenting and providing children with a safe environment at home can avoid children from developing negative behaviour. In other words, when parents do not provide them with a friendly environment they are more likely to develop anxiety and depression and this will cause them to develop aggressive and violent behaviour later on in life. For instance, a research study by The Guardian showed that 23% of the children in America developed some kind of violent and aggressive behaviour as they were brought up by divorced parents. I, therefore, believe that it is very important that children should have a good environment and proper parenting in their childhood. Ċ To conclude, although teaching discipline and right values can teach them social behaviour, I believe affectionate parenting and a friendly environment are more important as it will help children to avoid negative behaviour in life."
10811,Some students prefer to live on campus in a dormitory. Others prefer to live in an apartment or house.,University students divide two place the ones whom like to live in dormitory and the students who like to live in an apartment.Students who live in an apartment think that it is comfortable to live apart from university and others think that it is profitable to live in a dormitory.If you ask me i would prefer to choose living in an apartment. Ċ Living in an apartment is always good choice for me.Firstly you do not have to worry about other people for example if you are living in dormitory you should think about others student too.I am kind of a person who like to live alone and do not like to take responsibilities of other people.Living in apartment means comfort.If you want to take a shower you go and take shower if you want to sleep you sleep.Everything is so easy if you are living in an apartment you could make your own food at home or you can order something from outside.You could make a party at home with your friends. Ċ Second reason for living in an apartment is you do not have to meet with new people from university.It is enough if you are knowing your groupmates.New people means new problems.You do not have to be with roommate with the person whom you do not like.You could choose your roommate yourself or you could live alone.In apartment you can live with girl but in dormitory you can not Ċ All in all i think that it is better for student to live in an aparment rather than living in dormitory
10812,Topic: Is the economic development more important than protecting the environment for future generations? What is your opinion?,"Protecting environment and developing economy are both necessary works that human have responsibility to do at present. Anyways, I completely agree with the statement because of the reasons below.</b> Ċ First and foremost, economy is the basis of everything. Obviously a nation cannot prosper without the economy; a developing economy brings about the advancement of other industries such as tourism and energy. Moreover, any flourish country is always respected by underdeveloped countries, which means that country holds own hands the power to govern others, even world economy, by fully utilizing the resources and abilities of alternative countries. As a result, the culture, which has economic forcefulness, is more and more prosperous and profitable. Ċ Furthermore, recovering millions of miserable people is more important than saving natural resources. It is an evident fact that every-year, there are millions of people dying because of starvation, and it continues to increase if the government does nothing. It supposes that there are more jobs created owing to economic development, the homeless population will definitely decrease since employers are able to hire suitable accommodations by earning money from their employments. Certainly the natural resources will be faded away in case there is no human support anymore. Ċ Besides it, with scientific advancement at present, the industrialization has been putting much less polluting agents on the environment. Also, developing countries afford to learn from the environmental mistakes of the developed world's industrial revolution. For instance, nuclear generating plants are able to provide more energy than coal while contributing far less to global warning. We are also exploring alternative, renewable types of energy such as solar and hydro-power. Ċ In conclusion, in my opinion, I would like to say that economic development is the most necessary issue that any undeveloped country needs to carry out immediately. What is more important than economic development now, especially to unstably economic countries?"
10813,Both government and individuals are spending a large amount of money for protecting animals and their habitat. This money should be better spent dealing with fundamental issues in society such as poverty and health care. To what extent do you agree?,"Because of the annihilation of animals and biodiversity, official bodies and people strive to prevent the ecosystem by allocating huge funds. It has been said by many that this distribution should be spent on to tackle the important issues in the region such as eliminating poverty and provide better well-being benefits. I, however, somehow agreed to this approach and like to give my explanation in further paragraphs. Ċ To commence with, the animals and natural resources are in quite a danger to become extinct, due to the surge of pollution, more requirement of land for the construction of buildings and so on. Therefore, it is very necessary to conserve the natural habitat in order to maintain ecological balance. Moreover, By saving the ecosystem, one can mitigate problems such as global warming, rise in temperature as maintaining wildlife lowers the temperature of the earth and accelerate the levels of oxygen. For instance,r research by the University of Punjab demonstrates that preserving wildlife is indeed imperative for humans to ensure the procurement of flora and fauna and deter the heat levels in the planet. To follow this strategy the government implement several plans in Punjab to preserve the environment. Ċ On the contrary, along with the conservation of natural life, it is also necessary to focus on matters related to reduce poverty and ameliorate fitness facilities which are only possible through the efforts of both political parties and populace. for example, the government of Helifex is implementing laws to create employment opportunities and hospitals for the needed people who are not able to spend colossal amounts of funds. In addition, better health and education services prove to be a great tool to enhance the overall status of the country. Ċ To conclude, I opine that, enough proportion of monetary sums is required to protect the biodiversity along with functioning schemes which improve health care and increase the income of persons who are not able to receive basic necessities of life."
10814,Write about the following topic: Most people do not care enough about environmental issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is true that environmental problems are not received care enough from citizens. While there are some people who have attempted to save our environment, I believe these efforts are not enough to prevent disaster in the future. In the following essay, both these ideas will be discussed. Ċ On the one hand, environmental issues have not been tackled for a long period of time. There is a great deal of research into protecting our Earth which is widely discussed. However, it seems like people do not alarm how important these solutions are since some factors damaging the environment still continue every day. Industrial factories dump their waste into water and land; therefore, these environments become a place for throwing garbage. According to a recent survey, many beautiful rivers in the world turn into landfills. Not only factories but individuals also contaminate our habitat. For instance, instead of riding bicycle, people prefer to ride motorbike or drive a car to work and travel. The more cars they use, the more polluted the environment are. Ċ On the other hand, some people take responsibility for protecting our planet. Knowing environment play a vital key role in human life, people try to save our Earth as possible as they can. More organisations are found to raise funds for conservation program or to find solutions for environmental problems such as GEF, IPPC etc. In addition, environmental issues like global warming, greenhouse effect and so on are taught at school to raise children's awareness and encourage them to avoid affecting our environment. Ċ In conclusion, it is clear that people do not pay attention to these severe issues on a global scale. Nevertheless, if everyone makes an effort, the situation will change positively."
10815,"The increased use of text messaging using mobile phones is largely to blame for the falling standards in written English, particularly among young people, many of whom are unable to construct grammatically correct sentences. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","With the advantages of nowadays communications through mobile phones and other social networks, it is detected a bad use of what is known as the correct written English. In short, the facility of exchanging messages made a difference in sentence´s construction, particularly among young people. In my ,opinion I agree with the previous statement, there is undoubtedly a change in the way juveniles interact with each other. Not only through technological instruments but also in the way they speak personally. Ċ First of all, the new generations don´t give the same importance to literature anymore. While one can understand the other it is what matters. They actually adapt the language to a more familiar way. For example, they do shortcuts on the sentences in order to write faster knowing that the receiver will understand it anyway. Consequently, in the occasions where it is really necessary to write English correctly, they will no longer have the skills to do it well. Ċ Additionally, the automatic correction in smartphones impels us to think about whether it is right or not. Our phone does that for us. Personally, I think it is bad because instead of helping us write it, it does the contrary effect. For example, if I made a mistake spelling a word I will not gain conscience of that error. The same happens using the computer too. Ċ To summarize, although being able to reach each other 24/7 is an advantage, it is important to control it in order to keep some intellectual skills. For me, being part of the new generation is difficult. As a result, finding a balance between a more familiar communication and the correct one turns out to be a real problem nowadays."
10816,Countries should restrict foreign companies from opening offices and factories in order to protect local businesses. Ċ Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.,"It is often considered that foreign companies pose a threat to local businesses and, therefore, access should be closed for them. I strongly disagree with this point of view and think that foreign investments play an important role in the economic development of any state. Ċ First of all, the widespread involvement of foreign companies contributes to a decrease in unemployment in the country and an increase in state budget revenues. With the organization of production in the host countryAdd a comma,countryIt appears that you are missing a comma after the introductory phrase With the organization of production in the host country. Consider adding a comma. Ċ show examples there is no need to import the products from the previous country. In addition, firms that produce products that are competitive on the world market and are mainly export-oriented can significantly strengthen the host country's foreign trade positions. For instance, organizations in my home country have used this method and have received positive results. Ċ The second reason why foreign firms are beneficial to the host country is that they improve the quality of production. Their activities force the administration of local companies: to make adjustments to the technological process, allocate more funds for training and retraining of workers, pay more attention to the quality of products, their design and consumer properties. Most often, foreign investments are based on the introduction of new technologies, the release of new types of products, a new management style, and the use of all the best practices of foreign business. For example, thanks to American, German and Japanese companies and their advanced technologies, the production and sale of goods in my country has improved. Ċ In conclusion, foreign companies play a considerable role in the modern world. In my opinion, they entail many positive aspects that should give them access to doing business in other countries."
10817,Governments should spend more money on education than on recreation and sports. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"In recent years, there has been a heated debate that money should be spent on educational purposes instead of sports and recreation activities. From my perspective, I hold a strong conviction that these aspects are equally important and the expenditure should be evenly distributed to them. Ċ On the one hand, it is admittedly accurate that public funding for education has myriad merits. Firstly, if funding is well-spent on constructing schools for suburban schooling systems, it will encourage many young learners to go to school. For example, historically in Vietnam, many children had to quit school at a young age because of the shortage of institutes, which consequently resulted in a low literacy rate in Vietnam during the 1960s. However, due to the growing number of public schools subsidized by the government, many children nowadays had an opportunity to finish and some even tend to pursue tertiary education. Ċ On the other hand, monetary resources that have been put on sports and recreational activities also show a positive impact on society in general. For instance, several sports programs on TV encourage sportsmanship among Vietnamese citizens, which have been clarified when the national soccer team of Vietnam participates in tournaments, many people join together and uplift the mood of the whole nation during the period. Moreover, funded art programs play a pivotal role in enhancing the public conscience of an issue. To clarify, inside the Contemporary Art Center, many funded art exhibitions sponsored by the authority has been shown to effectively raise awareness in individuals regarding environmental problems. The masterpiece Erosion of Land performed by Truong Que Chi about the alleviation of fertile land in the South of Vietnam is one of the most prominent examples that are worth mentioning. Ċ To conclude, public funding should be equivalently sponsored in both fields, sports and education, because each of them affects society in a different way and all advantages needed to be promoted."
10818,Some people think that teaching methodology in the modern classroom should be based on Ċ experiential learning while others believe that the traditional approach is still the best. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion.,"Recently, there has been an emerging of many other teaching methods far from the conventional ones. As a result, debates have been raised over the eminence and appropriateness of each approach. From my perspective, each method has its merit to students and the combination of both should be considered to maximize the outcome in teaching. Ċ To begin with, numerous scientific courses are beneficial when being organized experientially. Biology and physics are some prominent topics that require the understanding of a learner. Hence, an engagement session should include some experiments so that students can be involved to understand thoroughly the matter. For instance, absorbing the phenomenon in some physics fields will help the information be embedded longer in the brain because undergraduates can directly perform procedures. Furthermore, experiential learning allows performers to realize some erroneous parts during the practical session. Consequently, this would tremendously contribute to the avoidance of making the same errors in the long run. Ċ On the one hand, the conventional teaching method still maintains its staple in some specific cases such as literature and history. These subjects were proved to be dependent upon the tone and the initial approach of teachers for the assimilation of knowledge. A teacher-led method during literary periods can also be exhilarating when a teacher knows how to engage learners in the matter and provoke their creativity. For example, during kindergartens, when most of the learners are premature to perform a student-centred methodology, guidance from teachers will enhance the imagination in students in knowing the characters profoundly. Moreover, when some historical events are arduous to re-experience inside the classroom module, the tone of professors could be a catalyst to help juniors relive in those moments. Ċ To conclude, each aspect of teaching has its benefit, while teaching with experience helps scholars remember in a long term with natural subjects, some social subjects are still in need of the voice of a teacher. These methods should not be put on any pedestals because they are both prominent to humankind."
10819,Some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. While others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is indisputable fact that some packaging of goods can give rise to the bad effect on the environment. Personally, I think that not only the manufacturers but also the customers should take a part to reduce the amount of the packaging. However, it is better when the government also take action to overcome this problem. Ċ It cannot be denied that the packaging of goods really helps the customers when shopping, due to the reason that bringing plenty of goods without packaging will bother the customers. Therefore, they should bring the shopping bag from their home which can be used every time. On the other side, the manufacturers should limit to produce the packaging of goods or they can produce the packaging which is sustainable packaging or biodegradable packaging. In the current era, several companies prefer to take action reducing the effect of the non-biodegradable packaging such as Starbucks Coffee and Coca-Cola. They have used the biodegradable packaging and plastic bottles which can be recycled to package their product. Ċ To reduce the amount of packaging of goods, we also need the role of the government. In the current era, there is a wide range of manufacturers and customers which do not care about this problem. They still use the non-biodegradable packaging to package their product. Therefore, the government should make a regulation regarding the obligation to use sustainable packaging or biodegradable packaging. Based on the regulation, I believe that the amount of non-biodegradable packaging can be reduced. Ċ All in all, to overcome the problem regarding using packaging non-biodegradable of goods excessive be needed the role from the manufacturers, customers and the government."
10820,people believe that success is due to 10 percent of talent and 90 percent hard work. Do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion.,"The definition of success varies among the people. Some individuals believe that, the major part of accomplishments are due to their hard work and the rest is talent. This essay will discuss that the factors that mainly contribute to becoming successful are a person's effort compared to their skill. In my opinion, working towards excellence consistently will definitely bear fruits irrespective of any talent. Ċ There is a popular belief that, anyone who has an inbuilt skill will surely excel in that field. This is because they can perform tasks related with complete ease compared to anyone else who wishes to learn. For example, a famous singer Mr. A R Rehmaan is considered as the best singer in the music industry because it is said that he talented to understand music. Hence, a skilled person may not struggle to as compared to someone who is learning the skill. Ċ Despite all these factors, I believe that if continuous efforts are put to learn, it will always supersede any talent. Even if someone has the capability but does not put any effort it may never show results. On the contrary, with the help of constant practice, expertise in any field can be gained. For instance, Albert Einstein a well-known scientist was never talented but, is a known genius for his consistent efforts in Physics. Therefore, all this proves that hard work can definitely beat any gifted individual in any aspect of life. Ċ To conclude, there are many methods to become successful. Some argue that it is important to have the art while others say it is dependent on the consistent work. I opine that, without consistency any form of inborn skills will not reap success."
10821,Some people believe famous people's support towards international aid organizations draws the attentions to the public. Others think celebrities make the problems less important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is true that the question of how important the famous people's support towards international aid organizations is.  While there are some people think that celebrities would make problems less appreciable , I argue that they could attract more attentions. Ċ On the on hand, there is a variety of reasons why many people underestimate the famous people's effects associated with global aid campaigns. Firstly, there are some singers or actresses take part in international programs for the aim of exploiting without enthusiasm. Instead of raising funds and supporting strongly, they use these world organizations to attain their goals which enhance their reputations. Secondly, when the celebrities participate in these organizations, people would tend to concentrate on them much  more than the objection of plans. This makes the purpose of the support go to eclipse. Ċ On the other hand, I do believe that the famous have a great influence on the aid organizations. One reason is that they would take advantage of the well-known to spread the campaigns thoroughly thanks to a huge number of fans. Moreover, celebrities could hold many live shows or advertisements to raise money for funds and inspire to followers. For instance, My Tam is famous for not only having a great career but also taking philanthropic actions or charitable donations in Vietnam. Famous people are able to make the  international fund more confident and public, therefore, the aid aims would become successful easily. Ċ In conclusion, although there are some throwbacks when celebrities participate in the global aid organizations to some extent, it seems to me that it is more advantageous for the community by the famous people's support as well as their voluntary activities."
10822,Some people believe that it is important to give gifts and presents to friends and family to show that we care about them. Others think that there are better ways to show affection to them. Discuss both the view and give your opinion.,"Gifts and presents definitely bring joy to a human being. In our ,society some people believe that giving something special to family and friends is important to let them know about our affection towards them. On the other hand, folk also think there are many different ways to illustrate emotion towards our beloved public. I will analyze both perspectives though I believe that gifts and presents are important for showing passion to the nearest persons. Ċ Firstly, I would say that an individual always expects something special or unique from his/her beloved people. Love is always a necessity but presents can be something very surprising to anyone. Thus, a person who loves his/her closest companions a lot should give them things to let them know the feelings. Gifting anything to someone can revive the relationship as well. Perhaps it may cost some extra money but it lasts great memories in their mind. Furthermore, to strengthen my point I would say a token of love can be more valuable to someone than word of mouth or a silent affection. To illustrate we can imagine a severely sick man in a hospital bed and his friend is going to visit him with a heavy heart. The friend can visit the sick man in bare hands but if he enters with a bucket of flowers, it can give that sick guy an instant smile with more joy. Ċ In other words, some people think that there are a lot of other better ways to illustrate devotion towards beloved family. In a particular situation, maybe it appears as true but definitely not all the time. People can take their closer persons to somewhere beautiful to visit, they can bring beloved ones to have a good dinner in an expensive restaurant or they can do something else expensive for them as a sign of great affection. However, all these ways are time-consuming and impossible sometimes because of various reasons. Even we lead a very rush life in our society as well. Therefore, a person can intent many ways to show affection to their beloved one and the question raises at the same time whether it is possible or not. Ċ To conclude, it is visible that gifts and presents can be a regular form of showing great closeness to the nearest people as well as there might be a lot of good ways to show the same feeling towards them but it is not as easy and effective as the gifts."
10823,"Due to the new technologies and the internet, radio is going to disappear in a few years. Do you agree or disagree with the statement? Give you own opinion.","With the development of internet and other advanced technologies, some people believe that the traditional radio seems to disappear from our daily life in future. I do not agree with this view, even though I do agree that the usage of radio is decreasing dramatically. Ċ Admittedly, A large amount of audiences stop listening to radio because they tend to spend their time in other entertainments such as internet exploration, watching TV, etc.. The internet brings a different way of interaction (on demand), which allows individuals can access the information they wanted actively rather than rely on listening to radio passively. For example, people could simply search the data they interested and view them anytime they wanted. Watching TV, on the other hand, is more vivid than radio. It provides a visual feature for audience, which makes interaction become more natural and enjoyable. Ċ But there are two main reasons for preventing traditional radio from going extinct. One reason is its convenience. It provides an opportunity to listen to radio that may contain musics, stories, news, etc., while users are doing other things. An usual practice is listening and walking. Another main reason is its availability. It is its availability that makes radio service is the one of the most common media around the world. People are able to listen to radio almost everywhere, even there are no internet access. Ċ To sum up, although I agree that the number of radio audiences is dropping duo to internet and other technologies, I hardly think that radio may die out in one day. The convenience and availability of radio are going to gain some audiences so that it is unlikely to see radio disappear in future."
10824,With the increasing number of refugees ever before most countries debating on the refugee programs/process. Does this whole process should be allowed? Discuss and give your opinion.,"One of the major challenges that most of the countries facing is the increase in number of refugees.If we observe the prime cause, it's nothing but growing number of conflicts across the world. Resulting, the growth in the people who abandoning their motherland in order to save their lives and their loved ones, which I believe we have to understand being humans. Ċ However, asylum seekers are more vulnerable to the situations starting from the journey from their home to the new country.They had to deal with trauma, criticism and moreover they even don't know the systems and procedures of the new country. Ċ Furthermore, the tax payers are also not happy if the government continuously accepting these people as this could eventually lead to increase the tax and effect the countries economy one day.There is always a scale of uncertainty with in the people that refugees may take over their jobs. Ċ Needless to say these asylum seekers add numbers to the census and in cases to the potential skilled employment levels.The governments could use these resources to back fill the skills short fall. Ċ In conclusion, governments should thoroughly investigate and restrict people smuggling where evidences are deliberately damaged.How often we witness the political blame game on these topics.In my opinion, every country should accept, restrict the number of refugee intake and constantly monitor the process to accommodate to the changing scenarios. After all, at the end of the day we are humans and should understand the word ""humanity""."
10825,"Some people believe that students should study a wide range of subjects. Others, however, argue that students should focus on the subjects they are best at or they find most interesting. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","In China, students are forced to study a wide range of subjects in high school for six years and many are useless in later study or life. Some people argue that only subjects which students are best at or most interested in should be learnt. I would like analyze the both sides in this essay. Ċ Most subjects are helpful to some extent in the way they teach some common senses in real life. For example, the knowledge about human's body from biology class is helpful when you take care of your health later. Besides, basic knowledge is necessary when you want to extend your research or career as many advanced technologies are cross-fields . Above all, people can only realize what they are good at or interested in after learning a wide range of subjects. However, all the above do not mean or require people to study deep in all subjects --- general concepts and practical knowledge are enough. Ċ On the contrary, people may learn fast on the subjects they are interested in and make success in the future. For example, great scientists in history like Newton, Einstein made a big contributions to the society. Moreover, people will enjoy their work after school and do not intend to commit a crime. Therefore the whole society will be benefit from it. Finally, people should have rights to choose what they like to learn and work. Ċ In conclusion, a wide range of subjects should be introduced to students which will benefit their daily life and future career. However, students should choose one or two subjects as their majors to pursue rather than study further in all subjects. In this way, it is more possible for an individual to achieve accomplishments and for society to develop fast."
10826,Topic:  Some people believe that to become successful in sports one should have a natural talent. Others think that perseverance and practice are a crucial part to success. Discuss both views and give your own opinions A genious is 1% talent with 99% sweat,"With the help of modern technology, we can always watch various sport programmes around the world as entertainment purpose. The successful athletes such as Christiano Ronaldo, the famous soccer legend, seems becomming closer to us. Some people think that talent is the key factor for professonal sport players to success. However, there are some opposers argue that hard working is the only critical concern for champions to achieve a sophisticated sport career. In my point of view, I agree with the latters as follows. Ċ Nobody will critisize on the importance of potentials. Many well known artists were found their ability on childhood. Nevertheless, a person with ability can only be ascertain a good fundation of career, to be succed in every aspect require long time practice. It is impossible to acquire new skill just after learnt it. Every sport technique takes time and progress for mastering. You may get fail for many times on practising until you use it in a real match. Ċ Some people may claim that many marvelous players are genious from the beginning of their career. That's true, but we should never forget the so called sport talents are physical conditions only. To be a skillful players, mental and phychological conditions are also important. There is no express to improve phychological conditions such as stress handling and pain overcoming but plenty of time to practise. Ċ To conclue, a sport player with talent is easy to get succed, but no players can be successful without passion and hard working. As Albert Enstinane said"" A genious is 1% talent with 99% sweat."""
10827,Anyone can use a mobile phone to answer/make work calles anytime or any where.Do you this development has positve or negative effects on individual and society?,"Recent decades have witnessed a major transformation of mobile phone. Distance and time are no longer a problem for contacting your families, friends and colleges. In my opinion, although people believe mobile phones have an adverse impact on their personal life, it remains many beneficial impacts on people's daily lives. Ċ The main advantage of using mobile is the issue of efficiency. People can delivery messages and solve problems without face-to-face communication. It is more effective and time-saving to keep in touch with your friends and families and colleagues comparing with writing letters. Students studying abroad will be a good example for people who benefit from mobiles for contacting parents overseas. Ċ Also this new communication technology allows people take more responsibilities. They can work at home and do not need to commute to office. The mobility of cell phones enables them to do more household chores and take care of their children. This is especially the case for working mothers who have to juggle work and family responsibilities and it is also improve the job satisfaction. Ċ However, using mobile phones causes great pressure for some people. They may have to work after normal working hours. It makes them sacrifice their weekends with family and leads to many health problems. This could cause lower productivity of workforce, which it may hold back the development of whole society. Ċ In conclusion, we could reduce negative influence of the mobile phone to least extent, as it does facilitate our work and also simplify our lives in many effective ways."
10828,"When international media (including movies, fashion shows, advertisements and other TV Ċ programmes) convey the same messages to the global audience, people argue that the expansion of international media has negative impacts on cultural Ċ diversity. What is your opinion?","Some people believe that global broadcasts and newspapers threaten states' cultures by delivering identical information to viewers. I agree with the idea because youngsters can be influenced by shows and motion graphics on TV and the internet, and western culture does not fit with Asian values.  Ċ One of the reasons for not internationally popularizing media is that its content might influence young people. Movies, TV shows produced by developed nations are often filled with dramatic scenes performed by attractive actors and actresses, so teenagers might get attracted and practice according to the scenes. Consequently, they might eventually abandon the core value of their culture. For example, when Saigon was colonized by the U.S, western music and movies were brought into the region. Accordingly, it resulted in the youngster falling in love with these entertainments and forgetting their own tradition. Thus, Saigon in 1975 was not much different from New York at the time.  Ċ Another reason to prevent the spread of foreign media is the difference between western countries and Asian countries. While western art embraces sensational content like sex and violence, Asian culture doesn't approve of such things. For instance, nations like China and Vietnam have special departments that focus on evaluating western films and they delete out parts that are considered to be sensitive information for the public audiences. For this reason, viewers can both enjoy foreign films and still reserve the value of their culture.  Ċ In conclusion, global publishing influences young people in many regions to forget about their own cultural believes and many foreign movies and performances display sensitive information that is not suitable for some countries' audiences, so I, therefore, believe that international media brings negativity to culture."
10829,The average age for individuals to give birth is increasing. Some people think that it will have negative impact on family and country. What is your opinion about this?,"These days, people are opting to have children at older ages as compared to the past. There are various reasons for this trend including younger people pursuing higher degrees and expensive behaviour. I have a vehement view that it is having detrimental effects on the families and the countries as well. Ċ The primary reason for people to have children later is that many people nowadays are struggling to get higher qualifications because of the harsh competition in the job market. Consequently, they are taking more time to settle and start their families. For example, in the USA, it has become crucial for almost everyone to get at least a Master’s degree in order to get employed in a well-reputed organization. Therefore, people are spending more time in universities to secure their future and families have become a second priority that is actual assets for us. Ċ Another reason for this problem is that people are preferring an expensive lifestyle. That is to say, owning a luxury car and branded items are demanding people to struggle for these things and individuals are focusing more to maintain such lifestyle. It has changed the social perspective that money can be saved to live a luxurious life by having babies later which is resulting in a sharp decline in population in many western countries. Canada, for instance, is facing a shortage of young workers to support their ageing population and to maintain economic stability. That is why they have started a number of immigration programs to attract people from overseas. Ċ In conclusion, obviously, the age of individuals to give birth is increasing on average. This issue is emanating by people to obtain higher education before starting their families and luxury lifestyle. I strongly believe that it is having extremely adverse effects on families and many countries are facing population imbalances."
10830,"Essay :  All museums and art galleries should be free, others think there should be entrance fee.  Discuss both views and give your opinion?","Although it is sometimes thought that museums and art galleries should offer free admission to their visitors, other people believe that there should be an entrance fee. In my opinion, I consider that such national places should not be free of charged for the public. (45words) Ċ On the one hand, some people think that entrance fee is indispensable for maintaining national places and I agree. In other words, governments do not have sufficient funds to subsidize museums and art galleries and there are other priorities for public money. Therefore, the money earned from entrance fee help these places survive. Furthermore, an admission charge provides visitors with positive experiences during their visit. In other words, an overcrowded museum would make it difficult for many art-loves to push through the throngs of people, let alone admire pieces of art. By contrast, a less crowded museum may enable visitors to stand and contemplate a work of art. (108 words) Ċ On the other hand, it is often believed that it is better if museums and galleries should abandon entrance fee. As people, we are attracted to somewhere free of charge, so offering free admission would encourage more people to visit. Another reason why many people believe that public should not be charged fee when they enter museums or art galleries is that it is an effective way to promote country's cultural background widely. For instance, visitors are possible to pay more attention to such places while getting stuck for ideas on their holidays when it is free. (97 words) Ċ In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I think that museums and art galleries should charge an entrance fee for help these place work and give positive feeling for visitors. (32 words)"
10831,Most societies have homeless people. Some people think that the best way to help them is to give them money. To what extent do you agree?,"Nowadays, it is quite common in countries throughout the world to notice a lot of homeless people and a few citizens believe to help them by providing monetary help. However, I opine that we should help by providing moral support, education, skill development and utmost in providing employment. Ċ Firstly, in the era of an industrial revolution and technological advancement, the most common issue we all face is an economical imbalance and a widening gap between rich and poor people. Secondly, many people find it difficult to get a job and if they have a job, it is even difficult to receive the basic amenities and fulfil the need of an individual or family and because of that they have to live on the street which is the rackless picture of today's world and this can lead to a bigger issue for many developed and undeveloped countries. Furthermore, by providing monetary help, we can only address their immediate needs and can not help every now and then. Moreover, it can lead to other issues like laziness and using that money towards crime, addictions. Instead, we should find reliable help that can provide permanent and long term solutions. Ċ There are many proven support models that exist if we wish to back them and as a whole, we can make a stronger and better society and the world. For example, we should focus on boosting their cognitive health and help to develop a positive mindset. Nevertheless, to address their immediate needs, we should provide food, proper clothes, shelter and health care. Lastly, we should provide education, skills development programs and help them to provide employment which can lead to living ethically and keeping their heads high. This would lead to a long term permanent solution. Ċ To summarise, we all can make a better society if we put some thoughtful consideration, programs and backing models in place."
10832,It's generally agreed that the amount of rubbish created by humans today is a worldwide problem. What do you think are the main cause of this situation? What measures can be used to tackle the problem? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience,"As we know, tens of thousands rubbish has been created by human daily. Obviously, it is definitely a terrible amount. More and more expert warned us that if human still not slow down the creating seed of rubbish, we will be face a serious problem. Yet why human still not able to control themselves? Ċ Nowadays, packaging becomes the most important part in a product. When customer choosing a product, they always look at the packaging first, even just a box candy or washing powder. It is really a strange behavior. That is why, the companies often put massive times and resources to focus on the packaging, they attempt to pack the product to be more competitive and attractive. Thus, it is increasing the products' sales volume. However, the main element of this packaging is paper, plastic and synthetic etc. All of these are refuse and really bad for environment. That is the main reason causes the problem of over-packaging becoming a more and more serious trouble. Ċ In order to prevent over-packaging keep going on, the only solution is the customer to refuse the over-packaging. Let us imagine, if everyone tries to choose less packaging product or remove the packaging and then throw into the store, it is a good way to shows that we don't need too much packaging. At the same time, family and personal rubbish also becoming a major trouble thinly. This is because they never try to recycle some of their rubbish, such as keeping take away containers, reuse plastic bottle and use shopping plastic bag as rubbish bag, etc. Ċ Finally, a further way to deal with the matter of increasing refuse is to change public and personal attitudes through education."
10833,Topic: Today more people are overweight than ever before. What is your opinion are the primary causes of this? What are the main effects of this epidemic?,"Nowadays, the level of obesity is increasing more and more than many years ago. This essay will highlight some key reasons and consequences of this problem which is challenging to humans. Ċ In my opinion, the main causes of obesity would be an inactive lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits in daily life. First, people are becoming obese is that because they are consuming too much junk food, fast food which includes the amount of fat, sugar, and carbs in fact of eating healthy food. For example, about more than 50% of citizens in American have become fat by these eating habits. Second, people rely on machine excessively in today despite doing it yourself which have less physical demand at anything. For instance, in a couple of years now, most of people choose to drive a bike or car more than walking or cycling Ċ The possible effect of obesity includes physical strength and mental power of human. Overweight indeed makes people staid and slow than normal people. This problem can make it difficult for you to get or keep a job in the long run because of low productivity. Also, I Belive that obesity is one of the most common causes of stress. Likewise, because of overwhelming outside, most people will have a lack of self-confidence wen among the community and society, and it will become a cycle when they can not confidence with others, they will stress and so on. Ċ To conclude, overweight is one of the most problems that affect plenty of people today. If not taken care of, these problems could lead to an unhealthy life."
10834,"some people think that to have a succeddful life you have to have university education, while others think it's not that important. discuss both views and give your opinion based on personal experience and knowledge.","Some people consider it is a necessity for those who desire to lead enviable lives to have a deeper education in universities while others arrive a consensus that it is not essential to get a college diploma. In this essay, I will discuss the two points form the following aspects. Ċ Throughout most of the 20th century, those who manage to finish primary or junior high school acquired sufficient skills and knowledge to handle most basic tasks and address working problems on a daily basis, when most large companies equipped their employees with fundamental skills through their own internal training and development programs. As a result, it is not uncommon to see employees enjoy successful careers, working in the same companies throughout entire lives. Ċ However, the world undergoes a transformation, which put an end to those traditions. As workers jump ships more frequently, more companies keep the money used to train fresh workers, which acts as a catalyst for change in job markets. Therefore, Job seekers who grasp pragmatic knowledge which suits the demand of particular companies evidently have the edge over those who do not have. A college education can well serve as a means to the end. Moreover, people attending university can also acquire what most adults will do for a living in 21st century----learning, which is the root of any success. Ċ So, although there are quite success stories in which those without a college education carve out a successful career, it is more likely to experience an inferior life compared with those who have. Ċ Hence, it is wise, if one has such a chance, to gain a college degree."
10835,Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people. Ċ Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.,"It is believed by some people that the amount of noise produced by humans should be strictly controlled by certain laws because of the nuisance it might cause. While the best thing about such a decision is protecting people from such a disturbing behaviour, the worst thing about it is the misjudgment that might occur. Ċ Despite lack of freedom, limiting the level of noise a person can make is a great solution to this troublesome attitude. Furthermore, this will prevent the mental and psychological negative effects that may result from being continuously subjected to extremely loud sounds. For instance, in Japan, a passenger who makes a sound louder than fifty Decibels has to pay a fee. Therefore, it's not only a smart solution, but also a wise one to the problem of noisy individuals and the consequent health issues. Ċ On the contrary, it might be sometimes necessary to induce a loud sound either to be heard in extreme situations or to vigorously call for help. Moreover, a person who has a valid reason to raise his voice might be inconveniently penalized. For example, if a passenger saw someone dying in the street and he started to scream out loud, he would probably be punished because he was being annoying without knowing why he was being so to begin with. It is for these reasons, a lot of details must be added when creating such laws in order to avoid misunderstanding. Ċ In conclusion, being annoying, the level of noise made by a person has to be controlled by means of specific restrictions as believed by some individuals. Although this would prevent the subsequent disturbance, it might also be unfair to be generalized to any situation. In fact, special things must be considered when applying these laws, such as the reasons behind inducing loud sounds."
10836,It is often considered that change is more beneficial to people than trying to avoid it and have everything remain the same . Do you think the advantages of changes outweigh the disadvantages?,"Some people believe that the changing process has more pros than cons. I personally support the opinion that there are more points in favour, such as the good impact on our neurons even though, sometimes, it requires a big effort. Ċ To begin with, it is proved that our brain becomes stronger when constantly subjected to different tasks. For example, the process of learning a new language, makes the person improve some areas of the brain never explored before. The specialists affirm that learn new subjects is also one of the preventions of some mental illnesses. In addition, according to the neurolinguistic programming technic, traumas can be treated by changing the path that the neurons follow. A good example is when someone is afraid of being alone. The therapist will find the main reason for that and change the way your brain acts. Ċ However, the decision to learn a new activity can be stressful, due to the big effort involved. For older people is generally more challenging because they had already built a comfortable zone. Furthermore, modify a common routine, for many, can provoke mental confusion and even depression. To illustrate, a computer system changed in a company I have worked, provoked mental confusion and impossibility to keep working in one per cent of the staff. Ċ To conclude, for the majority, an update in life or any task is positively received, but I cannot assume that it works in the same way for some due to any previous condition. I used to say that the only constant in life is changing since I believe there are more wins than failures."
10837,Nowadays people are working from home using computers and telephones. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this development.,"There is no doubt that nowadays' technology plays a key role to fulfil remote-working goals. This can be obtained smoothly by using smart appliances, which may help many individuals and companies to do their daily tasks efficiently. Thus, there are both merits and demerits that will be further explained in this essay. Ċ The main weakness point that most of the employees faced a sense of inconvenience especially during the pandemic crisis of Covid-19, which limits their privacy and relaxing home's atmosphere. This is because, on remote working shifts, employers may give tasks all over the day exceeding the time limit of actual shifts. For instance, the office-remote worker may resort to checking frequently his phone for clients' emails synchronizing to an online meeting with another client on Zoom application. In contrast, if home-based employees do not manage his daily time tables firmly, they may get tensed significantly as office-work shifts. Ċ The opposite merits of working remotely, those who argue for remote working have, are the minimum costs with the maximum productivity. To illustrate more, many companies have reported how riding out of daily transportation's hassle has an immense reflect on the competency of their home-based staff. For example, most employees now might start their workday from home calmly, and therefore consume less time in accomplishing tasks than latter. On the contrary, if companies do not supply their staff with the most updated tools such as phones and laptops, a plethora of medium-scale tasks will be rendered until their employee returns back the work safely. Ċ To summarize, although home working can provide a key benefit for both the company and its staff, it also may show some minor obstacles must be professionally faced even on long-term scales."
10838,The movement of people from agricultural areas to cities to work can cause serious problems in both places. What are the serious problems? What measures can be used to solve these problems?,"Massive peasants from agricultural regions decide to emigrant and work in some developing cities recently. However, the immigration of the workers has seriously affected the regular pattern in both places. This essay will outline the main problems that the development causes and establish some feasible solutions corresponding to these issues. Ċ In terms of the problems for this phenomenon, the movement of peasants reduces the agricultural activities in their hometown considerably. Consequently, there is a higher percentage of starvation, which is caused by falling crops production. As a result, the economy of these agricultural areas would rapidly decline. Another issue is that the unemployment rates and the number of refugees will continue to rocket in the cities. For instance, the labours who emigrate to work have no speciality in areas other than agriculture. Moreover, these kinds of workers will become refugees to live in the cities and thus, governments have to allocate funds to support the jobless. Each factor attacks the economy in the places. Ċ Nonetheless, the problems could be alleviated in a number of ways. One method would be for governments in agricultural regions to introduce speciality programs for those populations who would like to learn a profession. For example, these training programs could help peasants to develop technical skills in order to perform in the desired fields. Therefore, it would raise employment opportunities for the peasants in the agricultural areas and cities. Furthermore, the government from popular cities should impose policies on limiting immigrants who are working on the agriculture field in other regions. It could be done by the cooperation of both places. While one is imposing limitation policies, another government could regulate welfare for the people who choose to stay in the region. Ċ In conclusion, the movement of peasants to immigrate to cities can have a devastating impact on both places. Therefore, steps should be taken immediately to halt the increase in immigration from agricultural areas."
10839,"Because many children are not able to learn foreign languages, schools should not force them to learn foreign languages. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some feel that since it is challenging for children to learn a foreign language, schools should not emphasize this subject area. In my opinion, the challenge is the entire justification for supporting second language education. Ċ Critics argue that the majority of children are simply incapable of learning an additional language. The best evidence for this is anecdotal and relates to the increasingly large burden of work placed on young children. Schools in many parts of the world, particularly in high-achieving nations such as South Korea and Japan, are in session for many hours and students learn an array of subjects. They are usually taught English, the world’s lingua franca, and this is especially difficult for speakers of Asian languages, where there is little shared linguistic history. The end result is often that students waste time and may feel discouraged and lack self-esteem. Ċ However, children can learn languages better than adults and the challenge presented is itself an important lesson. If the schools have invested in proper training and use engaging materials then the lessons will not be boring and there is a stronger likelihood of success. Research has shown that language learning is most effective before the age of 7, with pronunciation becoming a stumbling block for older learners who already have fixed vocal formations. Moreover, the difficulty of learning a language encourages children to work harder and expand their ability to learn in creative ways. This applies to all subjects but languages stand out as students must seek novel memorization techniques and view the world from a completely different perspective. Ċ In conclusion, despite the low rates of success in many cases, the impact of attempting to learn a language is itself tremendously beneficial. Schools should therefore continue funding this part of the curriculum."
10840,"To be truly positive in the eyes of some, you have to risk appearing negative in the eyes of others. In about 350 words, state whether or not you agree with this statement.","A number of people advocate that one’s positivity in the eyes of some could risk appearing as negativity in the eyes of others. From my perspective, I voice approval of the aforementioned, believing that no individuals could please everyone, since our beings are open to subjectivity. Ċ In the first place, it is undeniable that humans’ personality traits and behaviours are evaluated through the criteria and judgement of others. In other words, whether or not we are positive is differently interpreted in dissimilar viewpoints, while being good-natured in one’s eyes may become wicked in others’. For instance, celebrities’ doing charity work is generally regarded as morally righteous; however, dissidents refute it as hypocritical and only serves to polish their images. Hence, there are always two-faced implications for all actions humans take. Ċ What is more, whatever we do, there invariably exists someone who naturally dislikes us. That is, even if we change ourselves to fulfil their standards, these efforts will prove worthless should their loath stem from jealousy or distrust. Though, it is worth bearing in mind that as long as we do not harm anyone, under no circumstances is our positive attitude towards others hindered by haters’ remarks and criticism. For example, while there appear many artistic productions that are harshly condemned by critics, several audiences still find it valuable, at least for themselves. This means people are not born to satisfy everyone, but should only please the ones who bring out the best in them. Ċ All things considered, although humans’ essence is subjected to others’ viewpoints, our core values go far beyond those sheer assumptions. Therefore, I am supportive of the statement, claiming that our being positive towards some may risk appearing negative in others, which does not matter as long as we do not regret our doings."
10841,"many people believe that in order to have clean and tidy streets in their neighbourhoods, this should be resident's responsibility, while others think it should be government's duty. what is your opinion?","An immaculate street is a healthy sign of a developing locality, and it also has far-flung effects on a nation's aesthetics. However, the body responsible to keep the lanes of an area is a contentious issue. Some say local natives should look after the cleanliness of their sorrounding area, others believe that the governing body should take charge of the same. This essay will argue why, I think, it is essential for the latter to be the controlling figure. Ċ To embark on, the government has the authority to implement a law restricting garbage disposal on the streets. A myriad of people lacks the enthusiasm to initiate the tidiness of their near-by area and instead of cleaning a pre-existing litter, many dispose their rubbish as well on the same spot making the condition even worse. Hence, the state can create a potential ripple that is constructive as well as encouraging by implementing few laws restricting garbage disposal on roads. To illustrate, the UK government has heavy penalty for disturbing the pristine conditions of the streets, and in order to avoid such fines, people help maintain these roads. Ċ Furthermore, it is the state's job to provide the basic facilities and utilities in order to have unspoiled roads, such as, public toilets and dustbins. Although these might seem as small necessities, they play a pivotal role in maintaining the locality's spotless condition. For instance, installing garbage bins at every few yards at a walkway, reduce a native's urge to throw rubbish on street as he/she spots a bin at a near distance. Ċ To reiterate, I believe that it is the state's responsibility to keep the city spike and span. This can be achieved by taking two simple measures involving implementing a no-litter on streets law and provision of garbage collecting containers and public restrooms"
10842,Television dominates the free-time of too many people. It can make people lazy and prevent them from socialising with others. Do you agree or disagree?,"Over the past couple of decades, the involvement of television in our daily life has been increased quite significantly. These days, it is often thought that TV could possibly contribute towards unsocialized behaviour and can make them a couch potato. I personally support this notion as this piece of technology is filling our leisure time way too much. Ċ First of all, television has become an only and easiest source of entertainment after a hectic working day so spending time watching our favourite shows is all we want. For instance, no one would like to go out to meet friends after having a long day at work, instead, the most feasible option would be sitting in front of the TV and relax. As a result, this becomes a habit after a few months and one may not like to hang out with his buddies at all. Hence, there is a huge probability of getting isolated and end up in depression if not paid serious attention. Ċ Furthermore, the TV shows are getting more and more addictive due to their amazing cinematography and graphics. These entertainment media has occupied us by the means of visual attraction the thrill of what's coming next, for example, a drama serial or a season is designed a way which triggers our curious mind to think about the next episode. In this way, we end up in front of the TV every day at the same time and our social life becomes secondary. Thus, excessive use of this could destroy our social life. Ċ To conclude, It is undoubtedly obvious from the aforementioned points that television is dominating most of our time spent with our friends and buddies. Additionally, it makes us dull and lazy due to an easy source of entertainment."
10843,The gap between rich and poor is growing. What problem does this create? What can be done to tackle them? Lowering the financial abyss between rich and poor,"With the growing population, the gap between rich people and poor people is steadily increasing. This trend could be ascribed to a few reasons, and definite actions must be taken to reduce the gap between rich and poor people. Ċ There are evident reasons as to why the gap between the high and low standard of people is rising drastically. The most prominent reason is the unavailability of education to people who are below poverty line. The focus of the world is shifting towards creating a global village which is highly beneficial for people in developing and developed countries, which doesn't have the major benefit of underdeveloped countries. Despite this, the mindset of poor people acts as a trigger for this wide differentiation as they won't understand the necessity of education and doesn't promote their offsprings to learn academics. Ċ To boost the economy of underdeveloped countries which in turn reduce the gap between richer and poorer nations, we have to devise some definitive plans. The action point should include offering basic education to everyone along with this there should be some kind of schemes for prospective students who are willing to pursue higher education. Furthermore, world organization should take measures in boosting the economy of underdeveloped countries and help them to grow financially. One such example is the act passed by United Nations in maintaining the peace and prosperity of Syria by imposing mandatory education for everyone in the country and providing financial aids. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that the aforementioned measures can create more peaceful communities and ensure the gap between rich and poor people is minimized."
10844,"It is common aspiration among many young peopleto run their own business, rather than work for an employer. Ċ Do you think the advantages of working for yourself outweigh the drawbacks?","It is undeniable that in today's world people's preferences towards the work have been changed. It is, therefore, the vast majority of youngsters prefer to become an entrepreneur, instead of working for someone. I firmly believe that it is far more advantageous to be a businessman, but its few potential negative aspects could not be ignored. Ċ To start own business enables the person to work and grow their business according to one's own skills and knowledge which is quite suspicious in case of working under an employer. Because it is seen that people who are working on the higher posts in the multinational companies have a different kind of strength and potential and if these kinds of people will build run their own company, then definitely they will be highly successful. For instance, there have been some recorded instances of people, who are running their family restaurant with some new techniques, are getting immense profit. Thus, being an independent entrepreneur is a big option which could be considered by young people. Ċ Conversely, there are some limitations to being a businessperson, which could not be overlooked. In order to start even a small business, one needs a large number of funds and immediate avail does not happen, that's why it demands time as well as money. Moreover, freshly graduates do not have any prior experience that how a business could be handled and due to this, sometimes people have to face the loss. For example, one textile company was established by a University graduate in 2014, in India, but lack of skills and strategies were able to shut down the company after 6 months with almost 6 lakhS of loss. Overall, the above-mentioned factors certainly need to be considered. Ċ To conclude, it is evidence that the trend of becoming a business owner is escalating among teenagers. Even though the notion has several benefits which I have discussed, but its flip side needs to be addressed as well."
10845,"Some people think the technology makes life complex, so we should make the life simpler without using the technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Today technology has become a major part of our life without it there is not a minute of the day which can be spent other than the time you are sleeping, although, the over usage of technology is making people's life very complex and hard to go around. Each of these has its own advantages and their disadvantages which I will illustrate separately and then give my point of view Ċ Firstly, without ,technology nothing goes around in the world today.Each and everything today is wrapped around technology such as, from starting of our day when we wake up we check our mobile phones about the weather whether if it is going to pour cats and dogs or else if it going to be very sunny, then we use GPS to travel from one location to another known or unknown places without it we all will be lost. The internet helps us out in every way from suggesting to us the best movies and restaurants around us to giving us up to date information on any topic which we are interested in any other topics. It even helps us to translate manuscripts and languages from native sources to the ones which we can understand. Ċ Secondly, the over usage of technology has made people forget to have a human bond and connection with others, folk are more interested in watching videos of places than going out and check out the places. For instance, even kids these days have their own personal mobile phones, mac books. Children are not getting enough physical exercise and are sticking their faces inside the gadgets and are becoming couch potatoes. People can't even find the location of nearby stores without the help of GPS. Ċ In conclusion , I reiterate, that without the use of technology we all will be lost nevertheless, we will also be lost without human connection and bonding directly rather than through social media. Everyone should have their own limits and their own rules about how long should they allocate the time for usage of gadgets and have a real bond and to go out play, take a hike, trek."
10846,In many countries the widespread use of the internet has given people more freedom to work or study at home instead of travelling to work or college. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Is technology a boon or a bane? This is the most arguable issue as with advancement in technology people are able to do their job remotely or do homeschooling rather than commuting to the concerned places. However, I am of the opinion that the environment which we adapt to while working at an office or studying in educational institutions are more beneficial for the overall growth of the company and also for the personality development of a student. Ċ Indeed, there are advantages of work from home or online classes as the travel time is cut down. Especially in metropolitan cities where hours are spend commuting due to heavy traffic. This time can be utilized to be with their family members. Moreover, balancing personal and professional life has become easier especially for working parents. For example, for a working mother work from home is a blessing since she can manage time for her children and old parents and need not hire a nanny or send them to daycare. Ċ Nevertheless, there are certain drawbacks of online schools and work .eventhough it is comfortable ,employees lack team spirit due to communication gap and may feel left out and will lose interest in their performance, thus affecting overall productivity. Furthermore, in homeschooling ,soft skills such as discipline, teamwork, competitive awareness and socializing cannot be taught. For instance, while on zoom meeting employees or students are not much interactive which they can be, when they are having a face to face communication. Ċ To conclude, I believe, even though people have the independence of online education and job at the comfort of their home, the drawbacks namely, a decline in productivity due to absence of team spirit and lack of overall personality development of a child due to inadequate social skills overshadows the advantages. Hence, the traditional method of going to college and office are irreplaceable."
10847,Topic- sometimes celebrities get invited to international aid events.Do you think such events deviate from their main purpose by inviting famous people?,"Collecting money through big star studded charity show is always cosidered a effictive technique.There is a both sides of this,sometimes this method is beneficial but in some cases this deviate the main purpose of aid projects.In this essay I will outline the both arguments-its benefits and also drawbacks. Ċ The most common advantage of this,celebs have used their fame to draw public attention to a range of humantarian and philanthropic activities.Take the Pulse Polio example of India,where a famous star Amitabh Bachan plays a crucial role to promote as well as to save the child's from acute diseases.As a result,their fans now come forward on highways and give the drops to all the children by stopping the vehicles. Ċ In addition,not only numbers of people increase but also charity fun reached at the climax.An obvious example of this,Taylor Swift,the immensly popluar sonstress from the USA,has donated the profits from their charity concert in 2014 to Asian public school.What is more,as funds and numbers of human's escalate,then automatically event acheives higher amount of things from public for example,Blood donation camp,where event organiser collect a large amount of blood with the assistance of philothropies. Ċ On the other hande,some celebrity takes the helps of this ais project for their pwn purpose even though the main goal of such events to emphasize addresing an issues directly related to helping people out with unpleasant situations.For example,Bob Geldof's live aid and live 8 campain,which promote their own brand with the name of charity. Ċ To conclude,i would like to say that involving celebrities in such events would certainly have postive effects.But in some events it go worse."
10848,"Because of the busy pace of modern life, many children spend most of their time indoors and have little exposure to the natural world. How important is it for children to learn to understand and appreciate nature?","In recent years, how children spend their time has changed because of technologically advanced tools such as computer and PlayStation. They are more likely to sit in front of screen playing games in their rooms rather than to go out with friends exploring the natural world. While I agree that children are keen on being indoors today, I firmly believe that it is important for them to explore and to understand the natural environment in order to appreciate it. Ċ I would argue that children today intend to waste their leisure time in a room playing online games or surfing on the Internet as their parents provide all of the technology such as a set of computer and PlayStation. A study shows that more than 75% of children in Tokyo, Japan, prefer to stay at home playing the technological equipment. Although they are isolated in their rooms for a long time, they always can enjoy it because they think that playing the games has the same activity as traveling to the world. Ċ On the other hand, children should visit some spectacular scenery over the world directly as the natural environment is absolutely different from what they see on the computer screens. For example, students in Al-Azhar school have a compulsory lesson to visit a natural garden such as an apple garden in Malang, West Java. As a result, they are able to learn and to understand all about apple deeply. They know how the apple looks like and what nutrition the apple has. Ċ In conclusion, it is evident that although children prefer to spend time indoors playing games or browsing on the Internet, visiting the natural world is also essential so as to understand the environment in depth. Where possible, parents sometimes should have a trip to natural park on holiday with their children."
10849,Topic: some people think cheap air travel brings us benefits while others believe that non-essential flights should be cut in order to reduce environmental problems caused by cheap air travel. Discuss both views and give your own opinions.,"Travelling by air used to be luxurious which could not be afforded even by the middle class a few decades ago. However, nowadays more cheap flights are emerging since technology has evolved. But it also comes with a price: increasing flights have been posing a threat to the environment thus some people suggest that unnecessary flights should be restricted in order to protect the environment. My view is that people should be free to choose means of transportation whichever they like. Ċ Cheap flights have made long distance trips more attractive. Tourists are always curious about the cultures or views that are different from their own, so they are more interested in travelling to a destination that is far away from them, usually abroad. Airplanes are ideal tools to reach these places as it takes less time and, sometime, are even less expensive. Spending less time on the way is not only attractive to people who have tight schedules but also is more comfortable, because people can easily get exhausted after staying in the vehicle for a long time without much possibility to move around and exercise. Ċ On the other hand, cheap flights are causing more damages to the environment as people are more likely to travel further and more regularly. Aircrafts, comparing to traditional tools such as trains, are not very efficient in using energies, which results in a high carbon footprint. Moreover, it is impossible at all to adopt clean energies like sonar or electronic cars do at this moment. Ċ In conclusion, in spite of the air pollution caused by cheap flights, I believe that low cost air travel should not be discouraged as it makes long trips more easily achieved."
10850,Some people think schools should teach students to form good behavior in addition to providing normal education. Do you agree or disagree?,"In the modern world, numerous individuals believe that schools should provide attitude lessons equally with usual subjects and I partially agree with this statement. The objective of this essay is to examine the positives and negatives of integrating behaviour classes into everyday lessons. Ċ One of the strongest arguments in favour of adding behaviour lessons to normal education would be good attitude formation. In other words, building a healthy mind from a young age will lead to good relationships with other people. For example, in 2008 ""Self-acknowledgement"" is invented as a subject in schools, where students discuss feelings, kind actions, goods and bad of life. Consequently, the integration of behaviour teaching hours into school programmes has been building healthy-minded students who are successful in their lives. Ċ On the other hand, the major goal of schools would be destroyed, the knowledge that should be taught will not be covered. This means that time for teaching material shortens. For instance, one academic hour in school is 45 minutes, where 10 minutes are for introduction and review of content, 20-25 minutes are for new material, other 10-15 minutes are for practical work, which means that every minute is important for the teacher and students. Hence, if some academic hour minutes will be given to conducting behaviour lessons content will not be covered and students fail on the exams. Ċ To conclude, all the above-mentioned points illustrate that despite good intentions to form good behaviour, the students might face some serious problems in exams. As far as I am concerned, solutions for these problems might assist to minimize hazardous consequences."
10851,"There have been many technological developments in the past few decades, for example in telecommunications, transport and health. What technological development do you think has been the most important? How has it changed people's lives? Have all the changes been positive?","Galloping advancement in science and technologies over the past few decades has taken dramatic leap forward in making our life much more convenient and easy. I believe, these substantial developments especially in the field of telecommunication which made the entire world interconnected and have been beneficial to people in many aspects. Ċ To being with, internet plays a vital role in improving telecommunication via satellite networks. There are numerous amounts of gadgets which made our life comfortable in various means. For example, online booking and reservation of tickets, bill payments, internet banking, virtual classrooms etc... are really helpful nowadays in contrast to the previous old day situation like standing in a long queue for everything. Furthermore, social network websites and blogs has cast its grip in our life which enable people to know each other and sharing information irrespective of their geographical locations. Ċ In addition, virtual classroom helps working professionals to pursue their studies after working hour just being in home with internet facility. It is common today to conduct video conference meeting from different region to do business globally. Ċ However, while discussing the positive aspects of these enhancements, we can't overlook the detrimental effects which are spoiling our younger generation. Children and teenagers seem to be addicted to computer games and social networking which cause them to be away from their day-jobs. They are all fond of living in a virtual world rather than being social in the real world. Ċ To sum up, though there are disadvantages due to technological development, the benefits always overweigh them. Hence, instead of being away from utilising the upcoming changes in the technical world, it will be better to educate our young minds to distinguish the real life significance and the virtual world."
10852,Libraries are irrelevant in the age of the internet and should not be publicly funded. Do you agree or disagree?,"Some people argued that, in the era of advanced technology, funding the public libraries is inappropriate.I fully disagree and think the aspect to stop financing the public libraries is completely wrong, and due to convenience and easy access to authenticate materials, libraries should be funded by the government. Ċ First and foremost, libraries offer ease and comfort to the community. Although the internet has provided wide access to online materials from the comfort zone of home, some people still prefer to use libraries because they are technophobes and do not have good command to operate electronics equipment. In India, for example, the majority of senior citizens prioritize the public because, for them, it is uncomfortable to concentrate over mobile phones for longer hours and they could not operate advanced features of their mobile phones. Hence, I feel libraries should remain in existence and properly financed. Ċ Despite the abundance of knowledge on the internet, people tend to use libraries as this provides them relevant and copyright information. In other words, there are the wide range websites available which offer the large amount of data, may be suitable or unsuitable for the user. Whereas, public libraries are only occupied by the authorized and authenticated books rather than unnecessary materials. For instance, research showed that more than 75% of data, available on various websites, are downloaded, modified and then uploaded after some modifications which are not suitable for the public use. Therefore, for reliable information, authorities should provide funds to the libraries. Ċ In conclusion, it is argued that libraries should not be financially supported due to the abundance of information on the internet. However, I believe it is essential to fund libraries because it is the source of real and relevant data. Moreover, it is easier for some people to use libraries rather than innovative technology."
10853,"Some people believe that fast pace and stress of modern life is having a negative effect on family life. To what extent, do you agree or disagree?","The biggest dilemma of contemporary age is its rapid pace, which is making it difficult for people to give quality time to their families due to burden and stress it exert on them. Indeed, I completely agree with this notion that it is creating a destructive effect on family life by splitting it apart and distancing themselves from one and other. Ċ In fact, people have less time to spend with their families because they remain busy in working, most of the time, to achieve their financial pursuits. They have to work like a machine, thus, they cannot provide time for dependants either they are older or younger ones. For instance, it has been proved through many researches that the main reason behind in increased number of old age homes and day care centres is lack of time from other members of the family, on whom they depend. So, that’s why they feel it convenient to send them to these institutions. Hence, it serves as a catalyst for the splitting of the family. Ċ Stress of modern life has affected the communication among the family members, particularly between parents and children. As a matter of fact, both members are constantly working day and night to meet both ends of their children, but they forget one crucial aspect of their better upbringing that is communication. Parents tend to equip their children with modern gadgets in order to lessen their responsibility to take care of them. Consequently, they depend more on gadgets and less on parents. In addition, they are becoming more depressed and lonely due to inability to express their emotions. Furthermore, they don’t incline towards their parents in later age as well. For example, a recent study conducted on young children by the American association of psychologist proved that children who spend more time with gadgets instead of real family members become victims of mental illness easily. Ċ In a nutshell, fast speed and stress of contemporary life is bitterly deteriorating the family life in the worst possible way. People have to ponder about this fact seriously and give more time to their family life in order to make it cohesive and strong."
10854,"Many developing countries are given aid from international organizations to help them in their development plans. some people argue that financial aid is important but others suggest practical aid and advice are more important. Discuss both views and give your opinion? the economic gap between rich and poor countries is huge, any solution?","To minimise the economic gap and help in the development of the poorer nations mostly world level organizations like UNO, do support the developing nations financially and in many other ways. Few individuals say that financial help is valuable while others emphasize on practical help and guidance, Both the conditions are important according to the situation of developing nations. Ċ Financial Support is very crucial and valuable for any nation to survive and support the countries economy, to minimise the poverty level in the nation and provide the basic necessity to people it is very important for a country to be strong economically, Organizations like United nations support these poorer nations to keep the surviving conditions in a better way by providing loans from world bank. Recently, United Nations have decided to forgive the loan interest of the poor nation, Nigeria to support them to sustain the life during the crises period. Ċ Looking at the second view, support in the practical terms like situations of war, natural disasters or epidemic disease are very critical situations for any nation to survive and struggle in these conditions, during this period suppport from international organizations are quite valuable for any nation, mostly we have observed during these crises time mostly all the nations come together to support their friendly nations, for an instance recently during the epidemic of AIDS, South Africa was mostly affected by the infection, during that period France made a tremendous effort to bring back South africa by providing medicinal support and medical staff to cure from the infection and eradicate the virus. Ċ In conclusion, in my opinion, both the views are equally important for the survival and development of nations, It is mostly dependent on the circumstances for the nation."
10855,Question: Computer can easily do all the basic and advanced calculations. Do you think your children should spend more time learning basic mathematics or advanced computer technology. Give your views.,"Nowadays, computer plays crucial role in facilitating children to figure out the number. It can solve the problem of calculation, whether basic calculation or complex formula. I believe that focus on learning basic mathematics is very important to children because they will learn the formula and improve their brain. Ċ The complicated formula is parts of basic calculation. There are combinations of arithmetic. Teachers teach systematically in schools that influence students to learn deeper about this concept and understand the function. For instance, the arithmetic curriculum is made for them based on age to make them understanding clearly. This helps them to solve the calculation manually. So they do not depends on tools to compute the number Ċ Another fact is stimulating the brain. Counting the quantity trains our brain to memorize and think fast. They will remember some multiple numbers that has good effect on their brain. In addition, math stimulates logic and imagination. Some questions related to daily activity such as shopping and buying needs calculation need imagination to understand and push the brain to find the number. As a result, the brain works effectively. Ċ In conclusion, it is undoubted learn manually has significant improvement for the children. children should learn the basic calculation to maximize and develop brain performance in growing age, and they can count the number without having to depend on computer."
10856,A society is based on laws and rules. The individuals who want freedom would face problems in this society. To what extent do you agree with this statement?,"In this modern century where every individual is democratic to live their life in own style but sometimes his living creates problem for other person then he had to face laws and rules created by society . The society creates laws and rules for safety of person who face problem from other community.The laws are made to kept Ċ to save from racism. I agree that every citizen of a country should follow the rules and laws created by society. Ċ The people live in society are of different culture, caste and even different community with different thinking try to create problem for other caste , these laws are helpful that time, for examples in India there is fight between two communities mostly between Hindu and Muslim , the can't live together, if some time there is small fight between them the complete community of Hindu and Muslim start fighting and a small fights become big riots in city so that time these laws are helpful to maintain peace .These laws are made by society to help people who love peace . Ċ Secondly every people have their own mind and thinking , sometime for fun he start beating other people to show he had so much power and courage so that time these laws help other people to get compensation or the person get punished by society.So laws and rules are necessary in society , it help to maintain peace all over the world"
10857,Nowadays in many families the grandparents are responsible for bringing up children. Is it a good or bad development for grandparents? Give your own opinion and examples.,"These days growing children is one of duties of grandparents. I agree grandparents can benefit considerably. Some people believe that it is very good chance for grandparents, while other contend that taking care of children by grandparents is not good for these old people. This essay is explained it is good situation for senior people to bring up their grandchildren. Ċ To begin with, taking care of young children has several demerits for grandparents. Old people can tolerate some noise and behavior. Therefore, when young children make noise, they become upset and tired. After some hours, they fight to children. Moreover, to keep young adult may cost for elderly. So, they have to spend money from their saving money. For the long run, they may lose their whole money. For example my mother always buys many junk food for her grandchild. Ċ However, being grandparents with young children has many advantages. First old people become busy by young children and are not alone. Therefore, they become less depressed. Also, children give their grandparents a huge amount of energy. Because, they are too young and do not know any things. Teaching and answering different adolescence make adult to become motivated to read and extend their knowledge. Ċ Moreover, young children may give chance to find more entertainment to grandparents. Since grandparents should go to park and amazing parks or cinemas to entertainment their grandparents, they communicate with new parents and other aged people. Ċ In conclusion, keeping care of young children has many benefits to older people. Communicating with new people, becoming motivated to increase their knowledge and reducing their possibility of depression are common positive side of these behavior."
10858,Pets should be treated like family members .Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons to support your opinion .,"Although many people agree with the statement that pets should be treated like family members, I personally disagree with that statement .Maybe my disagreement depends on my personal preference which is do not have pets at all .And I will try to give some reasons to support my statement. Ċ Firstly , nearly all of the pets do not live more than ten years. Treating pet like a family member it means you need to love them as much as a family member .And at this situation death of the pets after some years will bring stress and grief to the other family members. Ċ Secondly, from the medical perspective,there are many contagious disease from pets . For example , a friend of my died recently because contacted a disease from his dog. I do not think want to have the same fate. Ċ Thirdly ,for treating pet like a family member you should have good income . Because nowadays food prices increasing day by day . For example , my friend treats his cat with delicious food but at the same time he do not have money to buy for him some clothes . I already asked him that it is not good idea to spend your money on cat . But he is convinced that he is right . Ċ In conclusion , I do not think it is good idea to treat pet as family members."
10859,Many universities and collages these days offer distance learning programs instead of face-to-face courses. Do you think the advantages of this new approach outweigh the disadvantages?,"Nowadays, distance learning programs are becoming more popular than ever. There are two arguments apropos to this statement, however, I personally believe that it has more positive effects than negative ones. Ċ To begin with, distance learning program has brought many convenience as compared to the traditional face-to-face course. these types of programs usually employ the Internet as a medium to transmit education, which meant greater flexibility for both students and lecturer as they can have the access to the course material at any time. Furthermore, this kind of course structure would generally suit the working group who has limited free time at hand. Ċ Moreover, no commuting is involved as students can basically learn their course online, and at the comfort of their own bedrooms. In a way, this also would positively contribute to the cut in carbon footprint and emission. As there are numerous options for schools, students option on getting a degree would be greatly expand as choices would further include overseas institutions that provides online learning and not only confined to local universities. Not only that, students who enrolled in distance learning programs has lower expenditure as compared to others who study in the traditional face-to-face course. This is because, online learning students do not have to worry about commuting cost and getting meal plans on campus. Ċ In conclusion, the positive effects of distance learning course had generally outweigh the negative effects and I believe that more universities and employers would employ a more positive outlook towards distance learning programs in the near future."
10860,It is not necessary for children to go to school because far more information is accessible on the Internet. Do you agree or disagree?,"Distance education breaks the geographical constraint between learners and teachers, offering a band new way for all citizens, particularly in rural area. Thus some parents suggest that traditional school education should be replaced as children could acquire more information through Internet. Ċ Indeed, remote learning brings a couple of benefits. Instead of riding bike or taking bus to school, children save a great amount of time on the road. From the perspective of parents, they are able to devote themselves to working rather than worry about the security of their child. Further, none of teachers have capability to master various kinds of discipline knowledge. In other words, less information is taught by teachers compared with the powerful Internet. Ċ Those who advocated the new education approach, however, fails to consider the fact that distinguishing the right from wrong is a tough task for the young. Although a sea of information is provided, it is a pity that most of the information has not been proved by the authority. Children may misunderstand if lacking of proper guidance given by professional teachers. In addition, school adopts systematic way to teach children physically and psychologically. Loads of activities are held in order to cultivate the skills in communication and cooperation, which helps students access to society smoothly and gain a promising future as well. Ċ Compared with home study through Internet, traditional education still shines with irreplaceable benefits. The best way for children's education, I believe, should combine the two ways together. Mainly focus on the knowledge the teacher taught, grasping more extended information as supplement if children have enough time and interest."
10861,please inspect my grammar usage and essay meaning. It is for TOEFL Should university students be required to attend class ?,"While some people think that students must be required to attend class, others think that for students, attending class must be optional. there are some chances of studying without attending class. But I think that going to class is more proper and it must be compulsory for students. The following reasons will illustrate the my point of view. Ċ Of course, there are many advantages of going to class. One of fundamental reasons is that if you encounter a confusing problem or a something which you can not make out in your study, you could solve those in a jiff by asking from your professors. Moreover, the professors lead you to the right direction and can give you more knowledge than anything which you set about exploring. Therefore, in class, only there is a great way to gain education profoundly. It seems that university's class exists so that students can educate excellently. Ċ In addition, attending class grants prodigious opportunities to make friends with many various people. There is no point of feeling alone. Therefore, in class, it is possible to exchange experiences and information with classmates. In short, attending class is a simple source of making friends and being funny. Ċ In conclusion, according to my observation, I think that in contrast to students who are not required to attend class, students who are required to attend class are able to succeed in studying more. Because of those the reasons, it is necessary, for pupils, to be required to go to class."
10862,"Many countries are experiencing serious problems with their environment, with pollution of their land, water and air. Ċ What are these problems and how might they be reduced? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ Write at least 250 words.","now, Many countries are suffering from enormous environmental problems. especially the pollution problem of their land, water, and air. This essay will examine the main causes of pollution and possible solutions to this problem. Ċ I think the reasons are using chemical pesticides, human wastes and factory gases. When farmers use chemical pesticides to control pests, some of these chemicals do not degrade and still years in the soil. For example, D.D.T, a dangerous pesticide, still exists in agricultural lands. Although, it has been used for 30 years. Furthermore, throwing human misuse into the river or seas pollute water. For instance, you can see dead fish on the riversides where human wastes are found. Also, factories and cars come out of gases that pollute the atmosphere. To illustrate, a problem of the ozone layer led to an increase in the world temperature medium grade. Thus, the world faces many serious environmental issues with contamination. Ċ I can suggest some solutions that may help. The first one is using bio-pesticides, it is safe and degrade swiftly in the soil. Such as, Abamectin is a bio-pesticide that degrades 3 days after spraying the plants. The second solution is to put new laws that prevent getting rid of waste in the water. The third solution is to use a kind of filter which reduces the harmful gases from mixing with the atmosphere. All these solutions will reduce the contamination in all three parts to the safe side. Ċ In conclusion, contamination is a big issue that needs international interest from world countries. And we can overcome it by using bio-pesticides, legislating effective laws against throwing wastes and using gas filters."
10863,"Nowadays, many people go shopping in their free time. Shopping has replaced man other activities that people choose as their hobby. What are the reasons for this ? Is this a positive or negative development ?","These days populace are interested in spending time doing shopping which substitutes other hobbies and activities of the past time. In my view doing shopping is considered as negative aspect which indulges in wasting our hard earned money and precious time. Ċ To begin with, a variety of reasons can be offered to explain why shopping has a lot of demerits. First and foremost among these is that incurring huge amount of money is shopping results in unnecessary wastage of wealth, which can be used at times when extremely necessary. An individual should be wise enough to correlate and understand the basic necessity of life and get important things which are very much essential, rather than nurturing shopping as a hobby. For example, my friend spends ž of her salary buying things which are not essential for her and least bothered to help her parents who stay in the country side. Ċ In addition, shopping ideally involves commuting to a place where you can find all needed things. Therefore overall time involved in doing shopping attributes to travel time, doing shopping & waiting in counters to pay the bill. Therefore, it is certainly true that shopping kills a lot of our precious time which we can use in different kind of activities and nurture our hobbies. For an instance, people who often go for shopping almost spend one full day which is fruitless. Despite killing time in shopping it is advisable to spend time in some fruitful hobbies or activities. Ċ In conclusion, shopping should not be considered as a hobby which has several disadvantages, such as spillage of money and the considerable waste of time."
10864,"With deforestation, urban development and illegal hunting, many animal species are becoming endangered as they lose their habitat and some are even threanted to the point of extenction. Ċ Do you think it is important to protect animals? Ċ What measures can be taken to deal with the problem.","Various animal species are already becoming endangered and numbers of animals are increasingly dwindling. In my opinion, it is extremely important to protect them from causes that make them threatened. There are many ways to lessen the problem which we will discuss here. Ċ First of all, probably one of the main major issues is deforestation which is caused by illegal logging and water contamination. With the recent development of technology, there are numerous factories and vehicles, leading to damaging the biosphere which brings to draught. Animals lose their habitats not only because of draughts but also urban development as people cut down trees and replace them with modern buildings. This has now become dreadfully severe because food chain disruption also makes fewer numbers of animals and even potential extinction. Moreover, another cause is over poaching without permission in animals' habitual places. This may actually lead to the ending of some species. For example, it might indeed happen to Asian tiger populations. Ċ There are in fact much more powerful measures that can be taken to deal with the problem. As a starter, Government should spread an initiative to raise awareness about the affair and take strong actions such as fine a large amount of money and even imprisonment as soon as possible when illegal hunting and selling is being reported. Furthermore, together with Government and individuals, they should build facility centres for the welfare of endangered species in specific areas and proceed with precaution. Lastly, maintaining trees so that their numbers are not declining in the future. Ċ To sum up, because of deforestation, urbanization and poaching, a certain number of animals are threatened and people should protect them at all costs."
10865,"task: It becomes more popular to find out the history of your family, what are the reasons and do you think it's a positive or negative development?","Seeking the root of one's family has been gaining increasing popularity among city dewellers in recent years. This phenomenon, in my opinion, is a result of the alienation between people in cities, but can in effect help keep valuable culture of the country in this age of globalisation. Ċ Psychologically, a sense of belonging is essential for an individual to feel safe. The urban lifestyle, however, is not likely to afford people this. This is not only because of the fierce competition and poor labour relation in the workplace -- which can hardly make workers feel belonging to a team or the company, but also because the isolated neighbours in the living places rarely make the community a warm home. Accordingly, family becomes the only place where one can find this sense of belonging. They can be proud of a family member in their family tree when they learn a success story about him or her. And a closer connection may be established with a normal colleague or neighbour if a common early ancestor is identified between them. Ċ The process of discovering family history is also the process of learning stories about traditional values and culture. This gives the positive part of these traditions, which have been largely ignored by modern people, a chance to regain their role in the society. In fact, many young children in this country have started to realise the importance of and to show more respect to their elderly relatives and neighbours as a result of this process with their parents. Ċ As can be seen from the above, although the popularity of root-seeking stems from the unsatisfactory reality in today's world, its effect is in fact surprisingly desirable. Thefore, while the problems with cities need to be addressed for sure, this trend of recovering traditions should rather be encouraged."
10866,"Education is not a luxury, but a basic human right and as such should be free for everyone irrespective of personal wealth. Do you agree and disagree ?","Teaching is the most powerful tool for sustainable development of communities so it should be a fundamental human right while some people think that it is a special right for a group in society. In my opinion, I do agree that education should be available for all people, not be a privilege for anyone. Ċ It is a fact that education is a significant element to gain sustainable development. Firstly, thanks to going to schools, a community could be lifted out of poverty. For example, families having the basic reading skills will be aware of the way to get experiences to plant effectively. Secondly, human health could be improved by having knowledge of providing nutrition, especially for children. Thirdly, it supports sustainable economic growth throughout the student’s qualification has been enhanced and more decent works for higher-education graduates. Ċ It is not neglected that the importance of education is to contribute to the full development of human personality. The educational institution will teach children not only knowledge but also their behaviour in life. For instance, children should treat friendly and support together. In addition, people will be aware of the obligation of state laws such as stopping at the red light when travelling or preventing illegal activities. Moreover, graduates from the university will learn the experience and effort to gain achievement in their life. Ċ In conclusion, all information and knowledge should be provided for all crowds living anywhere in the world. It is predicted that there will be common standards for all schools, universities in each country without any discrimination."
10867,Some people think that having people from different nationalities and cultural background living together in the same country makes the country develop faster. Ċ Do you agree?,"There is a plethora of various cultures and nationalities from all over the world. Critics argue that grouping some of them together will boost the country’s development. Although there are two sides to this argument, from my own perspective, there are several reasons to why this suggestion might be effective, which will be discussed in this essay as well as limitations. Ċ It is claimed that having some variance in the country in terms of different nationalities and cultural background will support its development. However, culture is one of the most fundamental aspects of development anywhere, so would grouping several civilizations result in losing our own culture? It is historically proven that when different societies live together, their cultural background changes and new traditions are created by time, which is a mixture of their original cultures. In other words, it is the threat of losing our identity that makes this suggestion argumentative. It is no doubt that a country without a strong cultural background will lose its power, which might adversely affect its development. On the other hand, does this risk outweigh the possible advantages? Ċ With regards to quicker development, having some variety of nationalities and cultures might achieve this. Interestingly, it is well known that every nationality is famous for a specific industry. For instance, Egyptians and Syrians are popular for manufacturing textiles and clothing. This means that having a non-discriminatory country will allow different people from different regions to pursue their areas of specialisation. As a result, the country will have more manufacturers, which will in turn increase the Gross Domestic Product, which will lead to higher living standards, therefore, development in a short period of time. Ċ In conclusion, living with people from different origins will lead to the continuous exchange of knowledge, thus enhancing the educational and cultural backgrounds. It is also worth noting that this method will definitely consume less time, unlike other ways of developing a country which might need decades to achieve the target."
10868,"nowadays,many people have to work longer hours and they feel more stressed out than before.what are the reasons and solutions .","In today's world, there are fierce competitions in every field to win this rat race. Some crowd say working prolong time is causing more physically and mentally health challenges than past, for this reason,companies should have to make some rules to sort out this problem. The following paragraphs would elucidate possible reasons for the problem and propose a handful of remedial measures. Ċ To commence with reasons first and foremost is drastically modified technology. Moreover, more and more employers are captivated with advance fruitful processing hence ,they are not only pressuring their employees to use new techniques to complete others but also bullying them to work longer hours to fulfil team unrealistic tasks.For example, scientists have proven that in '90s population were unaware about use of soft skills suchlike, excel,PDF,Microsoft word etc.having said that though in 21 centuries all employees should have to use this program's so it is causing mental stress on the job. Ċ Furthermore, several folks are working a long time because of inflation in the market. Most of the youngsters are craving for advance pace life because their desires are much higher than past such as expensive cars, flats ,big villas, clubbing and so on.therefore, they are grabbing extra shifts and become a money maker. For instance, in most developing countries youths are working 15 to 16 hours per days to earn more money then they can support their families , complete desires as well. Ċ On the contrary, there is some solution to tackle this problem. First of all, the government should have allowed organisations to give fewer hours then people can hale and healthy because they will balance task and life. Secondly, the association should have given proper training to everyone especially who are green as grass then they can handle performance without pressure and complete it on time. Last but not least, the government should give some extra allowance, incentives and leaves to workers as they can enjoy their job and life. Ċ To sum up, it can be said that some people burn the candle at both ends to accomplish their ambitions if they will maintain their healthy lifestyle and learn more advance rules to handle goals rather than costly products thus,it could help for both association as well as workers."
10869,"In order to improve a country's education system, young students should be allowed to openly criticize their teachers during class time. Do you agree with this? What are some other ways education systems could be improved?","There has been much debate about how to improve education system. Some people insist that teachers should be commented by their students in the class time. I mostly disagree with this opinion because there are other improvement plans for an education system. Ċ There are some detrimental aspects of criticising to teachers. First of all, blaming teachers, most students may not respect them. As a famous psychologist in the UK states in his recent treatise, people who attempt to criticise others tend to focus on finding their weak points. Secondly, this method may lead to students and teachers fighting each other. This could make them difficult to keep good relationships. According to recent research conducted by the Japanese government, 80 per cent of student who belong to a famous law school which has good reputations in Japan say that they strongly trust their teachers. Ċ On the other hand, A much better way of improving education is to invite experts from overseas. It is generally recognised that most institutes that can provide good education positively employ scientists who advanced in their disciplines from overseas. Evidence for this is found in an up-to-date article provided in a major Japanese newspaper, Tokyo University which is well-known as the best university in Japan hired many lecturers who have expertise in certain fields in this year. another measure is that students give some lectures to other students. Adopting this method, students can learn what is important for how to learn subjects. Ċ In conclusion, I am inclined to believe that criticism of teachers is not effective in improving education system. Meanwhile, other potential plans could cause positive effect to both teachers and students."
10870,"QUESTION; People celebrate occasions such as ""independence day"" and ""mother's day"".Do you think it is important? What are the advantages of celebrating such days?","Yearly in the people's calendars there are certain days which are refered to as public holidays.People have rest from their work places and come together to celebrate these days.When families come together it means a lot to certain individuals and this shows how important are these days.Thus,it brings to one of the advantages to the individuals and as to the market.  Ċ These days are for the public,where they travel and meet their families.The families come together,eat and make merry to celebrate.For example,the independance day where individuals remember the day when they gained freedom from their colonialists.This means a lot to the people celebrating as they will be having liberty in their own native countries.Therefore,it shows how important is this day and when families have the moment for each other. svantage  Ċ Further,it also brings to one of the advantages in that of rememberance of one another.For instance,""mother's day"" where children appreciate and show their mothers how they love them.The children usually show this by giving them presnts or messages in means of a card.With this example it shows one of the advantages in celebrating these days.  Ċ The other advantage of celebrating these dys is that it brings rise to profits in the market area and thus an increase in production and economic stabilisation.People buy some presents and card for their loved ones .Shops make sure there is an influx of the produce.Also ,people use different modes if the transport to go and be will be. For instance, the stations are crowded so that they can get trans portcan get transport to visit once more..Thus ,it shos the advantage to the marke themaeket wen people make an effort to celebrate tjhesedays.  Ċ I In summary,why people remember these days because they are important to the people and to the market as well"
10871,"Technology creates more problems than it solves, and may threaten or damage the quality life. Do you agree or disagree?","Technology is a double-edged sword. After several industrial evolutions, we are heading to a world that its technological power is getting stronger and stronger. On account of this, people are arguing about is technology is helping people or leading people to a wrong way. As far as I concern, I think technology brings more benefits than its disadvantages. Ċ As we all known, Internet is playing a big role in our life today. Just talk about study. People don't have to learn knowledge from the school as before. There is a big amount of information in the Internet. For instance, if you have any problems you can just post it in the Internet, people who know the answer can help you when they see the questions. For history, most of the time we get the historical knowledge from the textbook. There is a problem, the history book isn't right all the time. If you look it up in the Internet, we can know the history from different people, different views. Online shopping is more and more popular nowadays. People can just type goods name in Amazon, E-bay, etc. It will show the price and provide the delivery to where you want it to ship. You also can save money by comparing the price from different seller to get a better price. Ċ With technology developing, our transportations are becoming more and more advance, from bicycle to jumbo jet. These things highly improve the efficiency than the old period. For instance, People who want to come to the United State from the England maybe need half month to get there by ship. But since modern jumbo jet comes out, it just takes 17 hours to bring people to the United State from the Britain. Therefore, It is convenient for people who want to visits the strange countries. Ċ On the whole, I highly agree technology is leading people to a new world, a better world."
10872,"In the past children were taught how to save money, but today they only learn how to spend it. Do you agree","In the previous period, teenagers were instructed regarding the method of money saving. However, these days, they are solely taught for the expenditure. I agree with the given statement. Ċ On the one hand, people can know how to save the income previously. At this time, children can get a lot of things by the little amount which could help them to save extra revenue. For instance, when they went to the markets to buy a necessary product, they could able to save some fund after purchasing all the items due to the inexpensive. In addition, they used a small box for keeping cash and broke down these boxes after a year only on the special occasions to fulfil their basic necessities. Apart from this, kids were preferred home-made food rather than fast food which could increase the saving and those who got cash as a pocket money also tried to conserve it. Ċ However, at present, the situation is just opposite to the past. All products are too expensive. When a person visits the stores by taking thousands of cash, then, they are able to buy only 1-2 items. In addition, nowadays, social media like Facebook, Instragram plays a vital role because people want to do show up their styles, dresses, food what they eat towards males and females through the internet. As a result, such activities encourage them to spend more and more salary on it rather that keeping it. Ċ To conclude this, youngsters can keep saving money in the past, whereas with the rapid development of the technologies, expenditure is increasing from sunshine to sunset."
10873,Successful companies use advertisement to make more sales. What can make an advertisement very effective? Do you think this is a bad thing or a good thing for the society?,"In the modern world, advertising has become an essential part of marketing.There are several things that can make a commercial powerful. I personally believe it has more negative impacts on society than the positives. Throughout this essay, I will explain it in detail. Ċ To begin with, celebrities are the first tool that companies use to make a successful advertisement. People who follow different artists, tend to use or buy the same products for their own self-satisfaction. This trick especially used in cosmetic and perfume industries. The second best marketing master plan is, they deliver a message in a short period of time. It can attract many people withing a few seconds. For instance, in a 2 minutes YouTube video, at least there are 2 to 4 different ads can be played to promote various items. Thus, using famous artists and delivering a message within a short amount of time are the reasons why advertisements are very powerful in the modern generation. Ċ According to my personal view, it creates various bad impacts on society and the environment. Individuals tend to spend more money on unnecessary branded products since they think that is a way of measuring the status of living. Therefore, some families who earn low-income struggle to purchase some items and they will eventually lose their self-confident. Furthermore, printed flyers and posters can cause environmental pollution. For example, a study done in Colombo University found out printed posters, billboards contribute 35% of environmental pollution. Hence, it is certain that there are several drawbacks in this trend. Ċ To sum up, even though, using world-famous artists and supplying details in a very short time are the main reasons for successful advertisements,in my opinion, there are various negative impacts for society and the environment as well."
10874,"Some feel governments, rather than private companies, should be in charge of medical services. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Although some people claim governments should pay for the medical services to the population, others feel the opposite idea. Once society already contributed financially through taxes, I completely agree that expenses of health should be in charge by governments. This essay will discuss why private companies should not the responsible and I will explain my point of view in detail. Ċ Some large companies claim the population should pay for particular health services so that they will offer better conditions, but most people do not have enough money to pay for these assistances. This assumption is a complete mistake whereas the poor population has rights like any other individuals. For example, if an elderly person does not have conditions to purchase medical services, he should not be ignored because during the active life he made his part contributing with work and payment of fees, therefore at the moment in which he needs financial help, he will be forgotten. In other words, particular companies just want to profit. Ċ On the flip side, some individuals believe health assistance should be paid for by governments and I completely agree with this assumption. Governments should invest and promote a healthy life which in turn would result in many campaigns incentivizing good habits. This way they invest money in the promotion of health rather than spend a lot with many days of hospitalization, for instance. In addition, people should have their efforts recognized so that they would rest during the senescence. Due to these reasons I totally agree with governments should be responsible for medical assistance. Ċ In conclusion, adults work a lot during life as a result they should have the right to health guaranteed. This essay argued about different thoughts related to particular medical assistances and I detailed my opinion with more information."
10875,"""Tourism is always a force for good which enables people of different countries to understand each other."" Ċ To what extent do you agree with this idea? Ċ You should give reasons for your answer. and include ideas and examples from your own knowledge and experience.","In a would of increasing level of globalization, tourism has been playing an important role for a long period of time, and the question of mutual understanding between countries is becoming easier to answer. Personally, I am inclined to believe that tourism has a positive effect on relationships between countries, and the reasons for that will be explained below. Ċ First of all, the flow of tourists between nations facilitate cultural exchange, which results from visiting national sightseeing, museums, and historical places. Having discussions with local people helps foreigners to understand behavioural patterns and the background of the nation. As a result, both hosts and visitors gain knowledge about each other, which builds a foundation for future cooperation and long-term friendship. Not only tourism creates opportunities to find new friends, and possibly partners, but it also forces the local community to develop communication skills. For example, sellers of merchandise have to know one of the international languages, at least on a basic level, in order to be able to make an appealing presentation of their offerings. Thus, the language skills of the nation significantly enhances. Ċ In addition, if the number of tourists entering the country increases, it will have considerable effect on the wealth of the nation. As the country becomes richer, people will want to visit other countries as well. In this way, the number of economic transactions between different countries significantly growsSuggestionhas significantly grownis significantly growing, improving quality of multicultural relationships even further. Lastly, even though government's measures to attract more tourists can damage the original outlook of ancient constructions, generally, states will try to preserve cultural assets, which could have been neglected in case tourism did not exist at all. Ċ In conclusion, I am convinced that tourism is one of the most powerful tools to build and sustain good relationships among different nations across the world."
10876,Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Based on research, climate change is the most essential threat for the next decades by which icebergs and glaciers are melting more and more yearly. People's opinions differ as to whether we should stand against it or cope with it. While there are strong arguments in favour of both of these sentiments, I would rather advocate the first group. Ċ There are several reasons why a proportion of humans believe we should become compatible with climate change and alter our life to this phenomenon. First, climate change is the outcome of thousands of years of human civilisation which have brought about plenty of technological and social advances. It seems inevitable to accept the trade-off between weather problems and sophisticated achievements unless we plan to live like our ancestors - without any modern technology. Second, planet Earth has experienced numerous alterations during millions of years which substituted many species in every era because of different reasons. So, it seems that we do not have any role in these changes and do not have the ability to confront them. For instance, our planet has experienced a long period of the ice age that could not be prevented by any creature. Ċ In spite of the above arguments, I support the people who agree that we have to endeavour to fight this situation because we are current residents of earth and we are responsible for the catastrophe that is going to happen soon. According to scientists, what humans have done against their habitat is not the sole but the most effective reason why climate change is happening. Thus, as payback, we have the duty to turn everything back again. Additionally, by coping with current circumstances, it is predictable that humanity will be vanished completely because of a shortage of drinking water, unbearable heat and breathing polluted air. For example, tons of hazardous gases are being emitted daily from industrial areas all around the world, resulting in the Greenhouse Effect and extreme air pollution. Ċ To sum up, although some people assert rational merits for accepting the current state and coping with it, I strongly support the ones who reckon that we have to confront it. I predict that in the close future more individuals will join this opinion by experiencing actual problems."
10877,Some parents feel that students should focus on all subjects equally. Others believe that students should concentrate more on the subjects they are interested in. Do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt that parents are concerned about the upbringing as well as the education of their toddlers more than ever before. Some hold the opinion that children should concentrate on the subjects of their interest while others believe that they should focus on all subjects. In my perspective, students in their first classes must learn all subjects and then focus the modules of their interest in their higher classes. Ċ Firstly, leaving the choice of subjects to students at the primary level may make them like easy modules with a little practical significance. For instance, it takes a lot of effort and practice to study mathematics and science, whereas filling colours in the pictures may seem quite fascinating to the primary school students. Therefore, it is not recommended to make the choice of subjects at the disposition of children in primary level. Ċ Secondly, forcing mature students to learn all the subjects may lead to loss of their interest in studies. Therefore, at a higher level students should be given the right to choose subjects according to their preference. Teaching a group of unrelated subjects to students at high school may be a waste of time and effort. For instance, when I was in higher secondary level preparing for my admission in a medical college, studying subjects like history and geography as essential modules were a nuisance to me. As this example shows higher school students should be given an opportunity to concentrate on their specialized subjects. Ċ In summation, it is good to get students learn all the subjects at the primary level, but in the higher classes they should be given a space to concentrate on their areas of interest."
10878,Some people say a person’s success in adult life is the result of the way they were brought up as a child by their parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today's world, one of the best things that parents look forward on doing is to raise their children in the best possible manner. Few pupils believe that an adult's victory in life is a direct result of how they were brought up by their parents when they were younger. This essay will argue why I completely disagree with the fact that accomplishment is a given post a good upbringing. Ċ Firstly, every father has a certain goal for their offspring they themselves have set. Moreover, every father tries to provide their infant with the best. Furthermore, to safeguard their own interest and the adolescent's future, they raise the kid in a certain manner, making him/her more skewed to have a successful future. For example, a family of successful doctor's would skew the youth's interest towards medicinal studies and instill good values of care for their children to become a doctor when they grow up. This has bolstered the notion amongst father's that they know the perfect recipe of prosperity. Ċ However, prosperity is achieved and can't be treated as a giveaway. One's own personal struggle is what helps attain fame in life and not good upbringing. Also, there is no specific age that one achieves prosperity as a guarantee, For example, Steve Jobs was an orphan since the age of 3 and lived in the slums only to become a tech tycoon at the age of 41. A path pursued relentlessly is what gives advance it's meaning over childhood. Ċ To summarize, this essay argued why I completely disagree that raising a toddler the right way gives guaranteed success. Whereas, success is more man-made than a gift given by others. In my opinion, that while every parent want's their child to be successful, it's not just good upbringing that suffices leading to a bright future."
10879,"Wich is more likely to lead to success as a sportperson ,mental toughness or natural stength? Discuss both viewa and give your opinion.","Many claimes that ,mental resilience is more likely to lead to success. However ,some people claim that natural strength is more important. From my point of,view, I strongly believe that mental toughness is more likely to cause success. Ċ Firstly ,in my opinion ,mental resilience could create a conspicuous power for different classes of sports and plays. For example ,there is a famous saying that sports are 90% mental and 10% physical. These people believe we can all be strong. This would create a noticeable motivation to get up early every day and choose a hard train to prepare for the difficult challenges of sports. Therefore this makes it clear why having a strong mind is more essential besides crucial than a strong physical system. Ċ By contrast ,others opine that the importance of natural strength are multiple in addition would seem more necessary than mental toughness. For instance ,we all know millions of football players can run well. This is possible by merely having strong feet. Mental strength is nothing if someone is not physically strong enough to play the games especially plays that is required to take more energy such as basketball ,volleyball and marathon. As a result ,it becomes apparent that being a professional sportsperson is more likely to be impossible without natural strength even by a strong mind. Ċ To summarise ,I completely believe that mental toughness is the most significant staff that sportsmen and women should have. It is predicted that this probably will create a suitable situation for being more successful in the future."
10880,"people lack doing exercises I have been practiced IELTS writing task 2 for a month. help me correct this essay bellow. Topic As a result of electronic inventions such as the computer and television, people do less physical activity, and this is having a negative effect on their health.  To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The inventions of many electronic devices such as the computer and television make people lack doing exercises resulting in their health. While some people agree with the idea that this development has affected people's health, I do believe that technology devices could bring more benefits to people. Ċ On the one hand, overusing technology devices such as computer and television might affect human's health. As a consequence of using these gizmos too much, dozens of children probably have a problem with their eyes because of spending a considerable amount of time in front of the computer or television. They can also have an issue with their spine when getting older. Moreover, people maybe suffer from obesity due to enjoying snack and other fast food while working with computer in a very long time. Ċ On the other hand, technology advances have several benefits which could help people's lives more conveniently. Firstly, the presence of a variety of devices is really useful in food technology. For example, with the support of the modern electronic devices, food analysts can examine whether the food is high quality enough to be imported into their country in order to protect their people's health. Secondly, people have the expectation to live longer due to the assistance of electronic gizmos in medical care. Finally, the appearance of fitness equipment has profound effects on people's health, they can do exercise in the gym with the support of the tools, and this way can help them keep fit. Ċ In conclusion, my view is that the advancement of technology devices has created various advantages to make human life more comfortable, others think that it has a small scale impact on their health, though."
10881,Question: The increasing number of social networking sites does more harm than good to people. Facebook can be taken as an example. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is certainly true that the social networks, particularly Facebook, have become an inseparable part of our lives. While there are some valid arguments to the contrary, I believe that the benefits of Facebook outweigh its drawbacks. Ċ On the one hand, there are some people who argue that networks such as Facebook are resulting in social isolation. To clarify, those people who are engaged in surfing the social sites excessively are tend to have a lack of confidence while ""tete-a-tete"" conversations with other people. Therefore, they do seem to loose their communications skills. On the other hand, the rest of people underline the fact about the existence of adult content which can have an adverse impact on children. However, there are certain advantages that can easily overwhelm potential pitfalls of using the social networks. Ċ Further and even more importantly, Facebook does seem to have a wide range of positive features. Firstly, many people have benefited from this social webpage for its usefulness in terms of education. Facebook users, for example, can get daily suggestions for their study aspects by clicking ""like"" buttons on different pages. Secondly, it has become a powerful tool in order for people to keep in touch with loved ones in far away places. Finally, there is no doubt that for the majority of people Facebook has become a place where they can share all their experiences (photos, videos, links and so on). Ċ In conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that the social networks that are similar to Facebook have been very positive trend due to the aforementioned reasons."
10882,"Task:  ""People face far greater risks in our modern way of life than they did in the past"" How far do you agree or disagree with this statement. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, technology is increasingly developed, we are living in a really modern world. This contributes to put forward a question whether people face far greater risks in our modern way of  life than we did in the past. I agree with this statement and in those lines, I will give you some specific information to support my opinion. Ċ People are suffering from a great loss which are made by modern things. As we all know, traffic accidents has always been a part of our life, yet the level and severity are larger than ever before. Annually there are hundreds of thousand accidents caused by cars,planes,..not to mention the wounded, great numbers of occupants are died.  Additionally, we also witness series of tragic incidents because of leaking nuclear power, leaking electricity,....which still leave enormous consequences at this time. Such things always create a profound fear in everyone's mind. Ċ Furthermore, the use of modern technology from factories, enterprises,... has caused environmental pollution and this indirectly generated climate changes. Therefore natural disasters may happen anytime, anywhere and even on an ultra large scale. Many countries in the world have to restore everything after floods, earthquakes, tsunamis,...many people are homeless, famished, infected,... and worst of all is death. So it is believed that ""the more modern this world is, the more dangerous it becomes"". Ċ Life is difficult, no matter which periods we live, I believe there are always hazards associated with one each, it is just smaller or bigger. In conclusion, the development of modern life has brought back a greater risk than in the past, however, we can not deny the benefits of modern life in some aspects"
10883,"In Many countries in the world,people buy clothes andchoose hairstyles according to the latest fashion.why is this happening?Is this a positive or negative development?","People are always eager to know about the lifestyle trends all around the globe.The upcoming designer fabrics and hairstyles are very important for society and they give much importance to the new swings happening in this area.The majority of the crowd consider this as a positive sign on the other hand side,there are people who argue this as a negative sign as well.In this essay, I would like to analyse the factors causing this craze and state my opinion with relevant examples. Ċ Firstly,technology advancement causes development in all sectors ,particularly in the textile industry and in saloons.Compared to previous decades the options available for these areas has shown a gradual increase and this tendency is due to the demand .For example,the number of boutiques and haircut centres now available in the cities are countless. Secondly ,the attitude of people towards life has changed,when we consider the past few decades society gives more importance to the way they look and they wants to be more attractive as well.So this mode eventually demands more improvement in the styles and hairdo sectors. Ċ Although, these changes can be counted as a positive development as well as negative too,since giving more priority to the trend and hairdo may affect the financial stability of the common man.For instance,youngsters are more attracted towards fashion and in order to meet their wish, they will do any type of work,sometimes become anti-social work as well.Following the latest styles will help the crowd to be more confident and they feel self-esteemed as well which is an advantage of this trend. Ċ To conclude following the upcoming fashion trends and arranging the hair according to that is increasingly popular nowadays due to the attitude changes happening in the world.Even though this can be considered in two angles both as positive and negative changes ,it purely depends on person to person and the circumstances in which they live."
10884,People think a law should exist so that young people under 18 cannot be out after the midnight. Ċ Discuss both the views and give your opinion.,"Although there is a section of the society asking for a governing rule, that adolescents should not get out of their homes after 12AM, the other section believes that there will be a negative impact on the young minds if they are confined indoors. However, I believe that, there should be a free hand given to the youngsters, on when to roam around with right virtue. Ċ Those who argue that, the youth should be contained in their homes after the midnight, might point out that, it ensures the security of the youngsters. Almost, these minors are inexperienced, and unable to handle the dangerous situations that might prevail at the late nights, they may land into legal troubles very easily. In addition, with this rule in place, parents will feel safe about their kids’ well-being. For example, as per the recent survey of The Hindu, about 68% of the parents voted ‘No’ for sending their kids aged between 12-18 years alone, during late hours of the night. Also, this rule must bring the policing costs and crime rates down. Ċ However, I would argue that, this possible law might seem fair from the parent’s perspective, but it's completely against the fundamental rights of this section of youth. In fact, there is a need for these young folks, to learn the ways of the world, and to be ready for taking up any unexpected challenges in life. Instead of this learning, by locking them up inside, society is not giving them a fair chance to grow and learn. To exemplify this, in many European countries, most parents send their youngsters for a compulsory community service during midnight such as youth-police wings, vigil units. As a result, these practices enhance the thought process and the maturity levels of this young generation. Ċ In conclusion, the possibility of making a law limiting the teenagers at home after midnights seem secured and financially helpful to the society, but, the life lessons that can be learnt by giving them freehand seems more appealing and productive in the futuristic aspect. Hence, I would recommend, that the adolescents should be allowed to roam around after midnight, if required, but with a genuine reason."
10885,"Some say that advertisements of toys and snacks have a huge impact on children and their parents, and therefore advertising to children should be banned. Do you agree or disagree with the statement? Give your own opinion.","Advertisements are becoming very popular these days. While some people are of the view that promotions of toys and snacks have a huge effect on children and their parents, others are of a different opinion. In this essay, I will be discussing the negative impact that advertisement has on kids and hence advertising to children should be banned. There are two primary reasons for this. Ċ To begin with, these days children are being targeted by large companies that show ads on different channels. Additionally, kids get influenced easily when they watch ads relating to toys, snacks and end up forcing their parents to get them those products they see on media. For instance, a recent study done in India showed that the majority of the population gets attracted by promotions that they mainly watch on websites and television. Subsequently, it has a major impact on all generations. Ċ Furthermore, nowadays commercials are also becoming very misleading and show a high amount of manipulated content. Moreover, the marketing strategies used by bigger companies on their products display only the positive content of the commodities and does not reveal the drawbacks that come with it. For example, people who consume snacks such as Lays, Potato chips, ice creams to name a few are having many health problems that lead to a bad lifestyle. Hence, the major cause of this is the commercials that advertise wrong information. Ċ By way of conclusion, I reaffirm my position that promotions have a huge impact on people of all generations especially the young ones and hence it is recommended that it should be banned for the kids because of the consequence it creates."
10886,"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Write about the following topic. Ċ Recently, abortion increases rapidly and becomes a controversial topic. Some people suppose that abortion should be legal while others are against it. Ċ Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 254 words.ou should spend about 40 minutes on this task.","In recent years, there is no doubt population is increasing, around three lakhs babies are born every day. While few couldn't survive due to improper care. Nowadays abortion has been debated by society. Some people agree with killing the kids before birth, while I would argue against it unless it is life-threatening. I will explore the reasons for both scenarios. Ċ To begin with, there are certain reasons to remove baby like an unplanned and unexpected pregnancy, where parents are unable to bear family expenses and provide valuable time to their children. Furthermore, in some cases Add a comma,It appears that you are missing a comma after the introductory phrase in some cases. Consider adding a comma. Ċ show examplesan infant will be underdeveloped and it might harm the other's life, as a result,it is advisable to abort inside the womb. This is evident because the condition is risky and two lives will be in danger. Ċ On the other hand, there are several grounds for not making termination as legal. Right to live is a human right, ending kid's life inside the stomach is equivalent to committing a murder which is a crime and also bringing this rule gives freedom to youth to move in the wrong direction. For instance,many youngsters take this rule as granted and end up having sex for their pleasure and go for miscarriage if they conceive. In addition to that, a lot of countries still believe in having a male child as prestige to their family. These kinds of people tend to feticide girl babies to fulfil their dreams. Ċ In conclusion, the government must impose strict rules against termination because it's drawbacks overweighs the benefits. In my opinion, it should be valid only in certain cases where situations are critical either for newborn or birth giver."
10887,Some people say that supermarkets and manufacturers have a responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging on products they sell. Others believe that it is the consumer’s responsibility to avoid buying products that involve a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"With rising environmental degradation, it is need of an hour to protect this planet by averting the underlying causes. Hence, some people opine that the producers and manufacturers should narrow down the amount of packaging on goods they produce, while others claim that it is the consumers who should avoid purchasing these products. This essay tends to analyse both the sides. Ċ On the one hand, it is believed that huge change can be seen if retailers could stop making excessively packaged products that are non-biodegradable and pollutes the environment. Therefore, the companies should transit to more eco-friendly and biodegradable products. For instance, the brands like Seventh Generation, Patagonia, The Hershey Company etcétera are not only the best sellers in their respective markets but also adhere to policies that allow sustainable practices. Ċ On the other hand, the consumers can take responsibility in their hands and avoid buying products which involves a lot of packaging. This will make manufacturers to revise their policies and adopt sustainable practices. In addition, the cost of the produced units would reduce to half. For example, in 2018, a senior citizen, in Bangalore, took an initiative and boycotted the packaged good that it ended up inspiring thousands of people to stop purchasing the products that involves a lot of packing. Ċ To conclude, I believe that it is the collective responsibility of both the individuals and businessmen to protect the environment. Moreover, the government need to raise awareness among citizens and if needed, the products that put detrimental effects on the environment be banned."
10888,"Topic 97: In modern society, some people argue that schools become unnecessary as children can study at home via the Internet. Do you agree or disagree?","In this day and age, based on the current impressive pace of technological development, people are projecting a near future where computers may supersede the role of teachers in classrooms. However, as traditional schooling brings irreplaceable benefits for children, it is believed that such prediction can hardly turn into a reality. Ċ There is no point arguing whether computers are extremely beneficial for educational purposes, especially in distance learning. With a stable connection to the Internet, a student can still acquire knowledge, search for relevant information and communicate with his or her teachers and classmates over a longer distance. This technology has allowed people to be more flexible in choosing the time and location that they want to study. Ċ Nevertheless, traditional form of education, which centers around a teacher, provides students with human interactions - a element that is tremendously important for the development of children. By taking face-to-face with teachers and their peers in a classroom, students can learn to converse and discuss ideas effectively. These skills are transferable across their future careers and occupations. Furthermore, teaching in a conventional classroom permits teachers to observe and monitor their students better. This is very important as it helps teachers to identify any student who may need extra help and attention to keep up with their classmates. On the contrary, studying over the Internet makes this task nearly unattainable. Ċ In the light of the aforementioned facts, it can be concluded that although distance learning provide some benefits for students, such as flexibility, the role of traditional schools will not be replaced in the near future. This is because conventional means of teaching comes with many perks, namely better communication skills and more attention for students."
10889,Increasing car usage in many large global cities has caused a number of problems. Some cities have proposed banning private vehicles from the city centre. Ċ To what extent do you agree?,"Many people believe that nowadays many global cities have several problems are from increasing car usage. In my point of view, it is hard to concur to such claims. Therefore, in the following paragraphs there are persuasive reasons to discuss this issue in depth. Ċ First of all, the main reason to support my position is that there are other ways to solve the difficulties. Take Melbourne for example, a few years ago, they reduced the price of taking trains. In order to encourage people to use public transportation more often instead of driving cars. By this way, it not only help people save money from travelling, but also improve the situation of environmental pollution. Such as traffic jams or air pollution. For this example, it demonstrates that avoiding personal vehicles is not the only method for the cities to solve the problems. Ċ Another reason for my belief is that driving vehicles is not the main reason for the issues of cities. For instance, my professor told us some of the major cities in Taiwan suffered from PM2.5. Hence, the government requested the factories nearby to shut down for weeks. As a result, they do improve their environment. Consequently, it can be said that the problems we have may not be solved by banning vehicles. Ċ To conclude, there is not to say that the project of banning private vehicles is totally without merit. Nonetheless, it may increase other issues. The government should figure out better ways to help the issues or they may need to discover the real reasons of the difficulties."
10890,Holding International games such as The Olympic Games is an exciting event. Some people think that it has positive effects while other argue that it is a waste of money. Dicuss both sides of view and give your own opinion.,"Hosting international sports tournaments such as the World Cup and Olympics can be a major event for some countries. Some people believe that it improves the hosting countries reputation, while others believe that they waste financial resources. I agree with the former view. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument before reaching a conclusion. Ċ On the one hand, many suggest that there are many other aspects that should be taken care of rather than building new venues and stadiums for games. Governments should take care of ameliorating and improving infrastructures and healthcare services. For instance, many people criticized Brazil for hosting the World Cup events despite the rising rates of poverty and declining medical services; saying that this money should be spent on these areas instead of building brand-new stadiums which be left derelict after the event. As a result, Brazil experienced major financial challenges after the World Cup because they had spent so much money preparing for this event. Ċ On the other hand, several individuals opine that such international games can have economic benefits in spite of the costs required in organizing them. This because many people flock from different nations to attend these competitions, therefore, revenues can be increased because of tourism. Moreover, this will encourage more tourists to travel to this country. For example, when Egypt organized the African Cup of Nations, people learned more about Egypt. As a consequence, more visitors decided to visit Egypt, and income from tourism increased. Ċ In conclusion, although it is argued that money spent on well-known sports competitions should be used for improving existing public services, I strongly believe that they can be a way to maximize a country's income through attracting more visitors and tourists."
10891,"Many parents complain that computer games have no value to their children's studies. On the contracy, those online games have produced a lot of negative effects on their mental and physical development. What is your opinion?","It's argued that computer games are valueless and harmful to children's mental and physical development. This essay compeletly agrees with this opinion due to the bad effects these games bring to teenagers. The essay will show why it approves of the opinion. Ċ First of all, one of the most obvious damages is that these games are highly addictive. It is universal known that many teenagers usually sit in front of computer screen for many straight hours or even a whole day to play games. As a consequence, they spend less time doing excercises and thus many of them start having health problems. According to a recent report, the proportion of obesity among adolescents in some big cites in Vietnam is really high and the main factor responsible for it are eating too much sweet and lack of physical activities. Some others surveys even said that many young male boys had died as a result of playing too much games without intake. Ċ On the other hand, addiction to computer games is definitely damaging to children's mentality in various aspects. For one thing, spending more time in playing games means having less time for study. It is not surprised that those who are addicted to games always find it hard to meet the deadline of their school assignments. For another, it is too difficult for children to pay attention to their studies when their mind just concentrate to games. Furthermore, lots of obscene and vilolent scenses in computer games might bring them to commit criminal actions. Ċ In short, from the points mentioned above, it is fair to conclude that computer games are indeed valueless and detrimental to the development of young children. Therefore, schools as well as parents should be alert to the issue and find effective remedy to restrict chidren to access computer games."
10892,Question: Some people think that seeing live events is better than watching them on TV. Others think that it is better to watch the same events on television at home. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.,"Nowadays, an increasing number of events, such as concerts, football games and musical play, are provided to publics. Some people think that it is better to watch such events in-person while others believe that watching them on TV is better. Personally, I think both sides are reasonable. Ċ Understandably, there are many merits of seeing live events. To start with, seeing events in live gives audiences better viewing experience. People can choose to focus on particular one play who is their favorite and watch his every moves, or have an outlook of the whole game whenever he wants, while others only cloud watch whatever on the screen if they choose to watch the game on TV. Moreover, it is more enjoyable to watch events in-person. People are able to cheer up their favorite team with other fans or sing their favorite song along with the singer. By doing this, they can really put themselves into the events and have so much fun with them. Ċ On the other hand, the advantages of watching events on TV are obvious. One such advantage is that it is free. TV offers viewers a ultimate free way to entertaining, while normally a ticket of one event is over $100. This would help people to relieve from their financial burdens. In addition, people who can have more relative information thought watching events on TV. TV hosts normally have professional background to explain the strategies that two team were using and give more background information on each players. This would help audiences have better understanding of the games. Ċ In conclusion, I believe both arguments can hold its ground, and personally, I would go to site to watch events once or twice every month and watch the rest of them on TV."
10893,Some sports are extremely dangerous to the players. Why do people participate in such sports? Tell some measures to avoid the risks involved.,"Sports are an important part of our lives, and they are played, enjoyed and watched worldwide. Some of these activities could be fatal or cause a serious injury yet people participate in it. However, there are some steps that can be taken to ameliorate any accidents. In this essay, we shall elaborate on the reasons and methods to mitigate the dangers. Ċ Firstly, one of the primary problems of a person’s participation is thrill and exhilaration. Some individuals are adventure-seekers and are ready to take-up challenges even though these could be life-threatening.

Lastly, sports are incredibly popular among countries, and many individuals participate in national and international events for fame and recognition; for instance, the Olympics, in which candidates from different parts of the world showcase their talent as well as represent their nation. Ċ On the contrary, when there is danger, there are risks. Hence, safety measures should be undertaken. Furthermore, a possible solution to this could be expert supervision should be mandated in each of these sports. Moreover, prior experience or training should be made a requirement; for example, it is already compulsory for an individual to practice skills and techniques before skydiving or scuba diving in order to reduce any mishaps. Additionally, a medical team should be readily available at any time. All in all, these steps could minimalize any dangers involved. Ċ To summarize, there are several reasons for people’s participation in dangerous activities. Alternatively, there are safety precautions like the ones mentioned above that can be practised to remove any possible risks."
10894,"Nowadays, children and teenagers spend more and more time indoors. Ċ What is the causes of this problem? Ċ What measures can be reduce this?","Nowadays, teens are utilizing an excessive amount of days inside of the house. This essay will discuss two causes of this problem such as indoor games on electric gadgets and homesickness. This essay will also suggest possible solutions to these concerns which are in twofold: outdoor sports and creative picnics outdoors. Ċ First of all, consuming whole day in the house has become very common among toddlers because of computer gamings and having home loving personalities. As a result, electronic gadgets are providing most of the sports online which can be played within a few clicks. Moreover, children are becoming house - lover as their parents are fulfilling their needs effortlessly, can convert them into homesickness later on. For example, 7 out of 10 teens are preferring to stay indoors for not only played or surfing on computers but also due to homesick nature. Therefore, attracted to electronics and indoor loving individual teenagers are undeniably choosing their rooms to utilize pace. Ċ Conversely, outdoor sports knowledge and some other creative tours can overcome above mentioned concerns. Consequently, toddlers need to be familiarized with sports such as cricket, basketball and so forth, which can influence them to leave their rooms. In addition, children should be taken to either picnic or tours by their guardians so that they can explore the world around them. After making these efforts who can still claim that teens are not leaving inside? For instance, applying these suggestions 95% of children are now choosing outside rather than inside. So, solutions of playing sports and creative tours by parents can overcome those concerns. Ċ In conclusion, spending a large portion of time has become widely popular especially in adolescents. This essay discussed two main difficulties such as love of interest and homesick personalities which can be defeated by suggesting solutions like outdoor sports and creative tours."
10895,"compulsory subjects issue School should be a place where students work toward academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery dressmaking, and woodwork should be not taught at school as they are best learned at home from family and friends. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Schools are the academic environment for students to gain intellectual knowledge and advance towards academic goals, therefore it is unnecessary to learn domestic skills at school. From my point of view, this statement is true to some extent. Ċ Schools are the place for academic targets and achievements. The knowledge students receive at school is undoubtedly important since it does not only change students' concept of the world but also prepare them for the future. The process of absorbing professional knowledge takes longer time and more effort than getting familiar to soft skills. Besides, basic culinary skills or needlework can be taught outside school or self-learned, while school subjects required to be taught by qualified teachers. Ċ On the other hand, adding these skills to schools' curriculums presents its benefits. Firstly, as these are vital life skills or even survival skills, students are certain to learn them at some point of life. Learning anything at a young age produces more positive results compared to learning later in life. Secondly, it is unfortunate that a number of adults did not realize the importance of these skills as children, then growing up regretting not learning them sooner. Hence it is worthy to get acquainted to domestic skills at school as part of the timetable since they will come in handy in the future. For instance, when students go to university and live on campus, they will be able to cook for themselves or do the washing. Ċ In conclusion, compulsory subjects at school may not include soft skills as academic knowledge is the main concentration. However, these skills should be considered as the complement for the curriculum for the sake of students."
10896,In the past people often get married and had children when they were very young. Nowadays many people choose to start a family later on in life. What do you think are the advantages of this development?,"It is obvious that people prefer to start a family later nowadays. Some people want to get more achievement in theirs career as they don't want their future family to be hard up. For more people family is too hard responsibility and they don't want to sacrifice theirs freedom till they realize that it is unusual to spend old age in loneliness. Ċ Clearly, it is very convenient to start family at an older age, because person got some experience how to behave with people and this experience will help to make relationship easier. In addition to strong relationships, people who married later can bring up children better than people married earlier, because young people sometimes don't realize importance of upbringing. And this cause is partly responsible for crimes, diseases and even drugs trade among young people. Ċ On the other hand, marriage in old age brings some unforeseen consequences. In old age very difficult to play with children, parents can not spend much time for children's amusement because of tiredness. In addition to tiredness, sometimes people should give up a lot of free time for upbringing their children. And as a result for somebody it can be very stressful. And mainly these stresses have bad influence on children. Some parents even could not see theirs grandchild, as they could not live that long. Ċ To sum up, the benefit of marriage in old age is financial secure for family. The problem is that some causes can have bad influence on children's behavior."
10897,"Q. Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ? use specific example and reasons to support your answer.","""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons. Ċ Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon-di-oxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth. Ċ Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon di oxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers. Ċ Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers. Ċ To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life."
10898,"COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY FEES * Topic: In some countries, students have to pay their own college and university fees while in others, government pays. Do the advantages of government spending their money on college and university fees for students outweigh the disadvantages?","The tuition in tertiary education is a controversial topic. While some people say that it is advantageous if governments pay university fees, I am in favor of the idea that students have to pay on their own. Ċ There are several reasons why it is thought to be more beneficial when tuition is paid by governments. Firstly, this may reduce the economic burden on families and students. People earning low incomes might be afraid of education fees; however, with the support of governments, their children have more opportunities to expand their knowledge and to be more skilled. Secondly, the equality between the poor and the rich is enhanced since everyone can study in colleges and universities for free. For this reason, the literacy standard may increase as well as we might have a more well-educated public. Ċ On the other hand, it seems to me that governments should not spend money on students' tuition for some following reasons. To begin, the government's budget might be reduced, and its investment on improving infrastructure, products and other fields declines. As a consequence, tax rises significantly whereas living standards can decrease, leading to a slow development of the economy. Furthermore, if university fees are free, students tend to be less respectful. They may not appreciate the value of money spent by the government. Therefore, perhaps not all of them attend classes frequently, resulting in low quality education. Ċ In conclusion, there are various conflicting views about whether the government should pay tuition for college and university students. Nevertheless, I am convinced that its drawbacks outweigh its benefits."
10899,essay: Some people say the world would be a better place without private cars. Others think the world without private cars would be unbearable.,"Unquestionably there are much more private cars now than there were a decade ago. It has been argued that if there are no cars in the world, life would be more agreeable, whereas some believe that private cars are very imperative in their life. I am going to discuss both views and express my own opinion. Ċ Many people think that as more people use their cars, the traffic congestion is an immediate result. In peak times of the day, it takes hours for people to travel even a few kilometers mainly due to the heavy traffic caused by the increased number of private cars. There is also such a common belief that using private cars is conducive to some serious environmental and health related problems. The car release carbon dioxide into atmosphere by burning fossil fuels which can cause global warming and air pollution that affects people's health adversely. Instead of public transportation people tend to use their own cars even for short distance travels and this exacerbates the situation. Thus, the more people use private cars, the more problems occur. Ċ However, those who claim that cars play an important role in people's daily life believe that the necessity of private cars in urgent cases is undisputable. For instance, if somebody is late for work, the private cars are the only way out. Another favorable aspect of private cars is that people feel totally at ease in their own cars. Ċ All in all, despite some problems which come along with private cars, one could hardly cast doubt on the role of private cars in people's life. From my viewpoint, the world without private cars is unimaginable."
10900,"In many countries, more and more young people are leaving schools and unable to find jobs after graduation. What problems do you think youth unemployment will cause to the individual and the society? Give reasons and make some suggestions.","Nowadays, along with the rapid development of high-technology, more and more young people face the danger of unemployment, some of them have been closed outsides the doors of workplaces even before they have a chance to step into them. Ċ The influences of this phenomenon both on individuals and on society are extremely far-reaching. In terms of individuals, unemployment means the negative to his/her ability of working. In other words, his/her have not be able to adjust the society demands. This would not only bring serious spirit pressure to individuals, but also probably result in the family quarrels caused by the economic stress. In the aspect of society, unemployment suggests the increasing burden to society and government. A large number of unemployed youth will absolutely consume enormous society resources which will directly lead to the decrease of life quality of the whole social members. Ċ To solve this problem need the joint effort of individuals, society and government. First of all, individuals should try his/her best to adjust himself/herself to adjust the society demands by enriching his/her knowledge and studying new skills. Meanwhile, the society and government should spare no effort to provide create such a condition for individuals, such as holding training classes, open technical schools, according to the society demands. by this way, not only will the individuals unemployment questions be solved successfully, but also the quality of the whole society will get improved enormously. Ċ In conclusion, in my view, unemployment is not a serious question, the serious question should be the attitudes of individuals, society and government to deal with this issue. How will us choose , to give up or to accept challenge? I think the latter undoubtedly is the wise choice."
10901,"When international media (including movies, fashion shows, advertisements and other TV programmes) convey the same messages to the global audience, people argue that the expansion of international media has negative impacts on cultural diversity. What is your opinion?","As globalization booming day by day, the term of media is also increasing significantly. The growing popularity and sustainability of some international media programs such as movies, fashion shows, diverse TV programs and advertisements is posing worldwide concern and causing to redaction of cultural value and diversity, also transformation of the locals' way of life. In my view, improving transnational media has many drawbacks in cultural diversity and cultural globalization. Ċ First of all, it is visible that international media includes a raft of giant companies which dominating across the world. For instance, Time Warner, Universal and Walt Disney. From my point of view, they control approximately half of the media market and put cultural environment at risk. The dwindling in the number of national media will pose a depletion of the variety and interesting programs such as traditional songs and movies. By this historical value of traditions and cultures of people will disappear. Ċ Second of all, the loss of national diversity is also cause to the locals' ways of life and cultural globalization. Thus, the improving of global entertainment is affecting the locals by reflecting on the beliefs, lifestyle and norm of ordinary people in varied nations. For example, in some countries many people now imitating other lands' lifestyle by obeying their habits or wearing clothes like them. Even some people adjusting their religion. Ċ In conclusion, I want to recapitulate that all these changes are the cause of international movies, TV shows, music, newspapers and advertisements. The local people should avoid mass transnational media in order to make a stable cultural diversity."
10902,"We live in a world in which we are constantly exposed to advertising. Ċ To what extent does advertising influence our choices as consumers, and what effect does it have on our lifestyles? Ċ Discuss the issue and give your opinion.","Over the years advertisements became more and more popular.We are exposed to them on the radio, on Tv, in the trailers of movies, buses, billboards, and they are promoted even by a lot of celebrities. Our choices as costumers are controlled by the advertisements due to the impossibility to avoid them. In my opinion they have a huge impact and in many cases, people end up buying things that they actually do not need. Ċ Firstly, insecurity is a reason why many costumers buy things that they actually do not like.The people who make advertisements take advantage from those who have problems accepting their personality. People that suffer from this disease are very vulnerable to the force of advertisements.For instance, if someone is feeling insecure about their appearance, and sees a beautiful model wearing certain clothes in an advertisement, she or he may feel more beautiful if they had those clothes.To conclude, people often cannot say what their decisions are based on, and in these cases advertisements succeed to change their mind. Ċ Furthermore, the brunt that advertisements have can impact people living in various ways. The most obviously worrying influence is that people who feel the need for a constant possession will of course be under considerable extra financial strain.For example, many people who are found in this situation begin working longer hours and spend less time with the loved ones.Therefore, they might become anxious and depressed due to the constant need for buying new things. Ċ To summarize, by seeing advertisements people are in a constant need for buying things that they actually do not need.Consequently, it is well known that the peoples' choices are affected in many cases by advertisements.After thorough analysis on this subject, advertisements have a huge impact on our lives and it seems very unlikely that anyone can escape their influence in today’s world."
10903,More and more schools allow fast-food restaurants to sell their products to their students. Ċ Is it a positive or negative development?,"Many educational institutes are permitting the junk food outlets, to trade their produce to the pupils. This approach can lead to the major health issues in the students, and can also slow down the growth. Therefore, this is undoubtedly an unfavourable progress. This essay will discuss its impact in detail with a suitable example. Ċ Firstly, the processed food available in the canteens, contains a huge amount of fat and sugar, which causes obesity, diabetes, and even cancer. In other words, the over consumption of such products can have adverse effects on the health of the school-going children. Moreover, it will directly have influence on their academic performance because there will be more chances of students getting sick. For instance, according to a survey conducted by the University of Shimla, in 2016, in India, it was found that the students who consume a lot of unhealthy, ready-to-eat products show poor school results. Ċ Secondly, most of the fast- food places have packed foodstuff, which contain various preservatives, and are directly linked to a decline in the mental and physical development. This is to say that the daily consumption at such restaurants will reduce the growth of children. Furthermore, they will have an inactive brain, which decreases the effective learning in the adolescents. To exemplify, the research carried out in 2018, in the University of Nainital, India, says that the long-term consumption of preservatives causes a 40% of reduction in the cognitive development of human beings. Thus, the selling of the processed foodstuffs in schools is extremely harmful. Ċ To conclude, the retailing of junk products in school premises is a negative growth. Moreover, its daily utilisation reduces the progress, and enhances the risk of deadly diseases in pupils."
10904,Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try. New things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and example to support your choice,"People have different attitude and understanding.. Some people like to do what he have it or continue living on that, but some other people are like to do some new thing or try to more advantage or benefit in their life without concern for risk. As for me I m prefers to do what I have and no like to try new thing as no take risk ether. Ċ According to the people like to do only what they already do well. These kinds of people have more comfortable and suitable job him or her. They have not take risk and no tension for failing the business or huge lost the profit. They want safe or simple life and no more popular or surprise to other. Also may be they have no budget to trying new things. For example like teacher. Very simple and not risks for life Ċ But some are very brave to take risks to prefer for new things. They are very confident and intelligent. No need to concern to their future life and try to get more benefit or profit in life. For example some of business man is very greedy to get profit. First time they are selling very simple and then increase the quality of goods. After year ago they try to selling the illegal goods. Because they have get double profit then the simple goods, but I don't think that the entire risks job are not illegal or bad. also some people want to do some more surprise or popular in their life. Ċ In my conclusion, I would to say that whether taking this or that. its all are our choice and no one will control it. i am very afraid to taking risk in my life. this is our life."
10905,"Some people say that modern buildings are ugly and are ruining our towns and cities, especially when these buildings are very different from those around them. Others say that they add variety and interest. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Sophisticated constructions in the city center is not merely give worth-looking for the society. Numerous people argue that these virtually showing poor appearance toward that city, but others convince that a dozens of sacrifice building it could be make that region livelier. In this essay I will compare these issue and give my view. Ċ With regard to, globalization literally has been escorting people to build up several monumental buildings with kinds of design. However, it is not mean that creating new establishment also replaced original form of that region. Many people believe that impressive architecture owed by one region would damage cultural character of that area. Consequently, local communities could lost their old houses as a symbol of that region. As an example, in Bali, Indonesia, the governments proscribe their society to build up structures no more than four storey because they believe that their prayer building (Pura) should be higher than others construction. Ċ On the other hand, some people regard as remarkable building located in inner city will attract the occupant attention because of the unique appearance. Furthermore, it is also can be used as tourist's attraction because in a big city poorly beautiful place. Besides, the increasing number of modern building in one town is also symbolize of their prosperous citizen live there. Ċ All in all, there are convincing argument both the presence of modern buildings in the central city, I would argue that cutting-edge design of building belonged to the cities, it cannot be restricted by traditionalist understanding, but it would be better if it mixed to construct the new buildings."
10906,"Some people feel that certain workers like nurses, doctors and teachers are undervalued and should be paid more, especially when other people like film actors or company bosses are paid huge sums of money that are out of proportion to the importance of the work that they do. Ċ How far do you agree? Ċ What criteria should be used to decide how much people are paid?","There has been a prevailing opinion that some specific types of work like doctors, teachers are underpaid while celebrities, as well as company presidents, earn a disagreeably huge amount of money. This essay discusses the factors affecting the salary of each occupation and states by perspective, being that I completely disagree with that growing belief. Ċ The reason why I am fully against this idea is due to the fact that jobs including actors and bosses require to cope with tremendous pressure. Unlike other occupations like teachers or nurses, these kinds of employment are based on flexibility and instinct, which do not have the exact approach to each issue. Therefore, when it comes to unexpected problems, they bear a great deal of pressure to come up with solutions immediately without any guidelines for the upcoming procedure whatsoever. To illustrate, singers are expected to free-style to some extent so as to show their singing skills besides the competence to follow the exact tones that they need to reach. Ċ There are, henceforth, a range of possible criteria to evaluate one’s earning. Firstly, every salary should be based on the impact which their jobs make on society. Should their work be beneficial to a huge community and help them upgrade the standard of living, their income shall be high in return. Furthermore, in terms of businesses, undoubtedly, their earnings would be decided by the amount of money they have gained at the end of the selling products period. In fact, there are no exact factors that could determine the extent of one’s income since they depend on the competence of workers, which is unmeasurable. Ċ To conclude, I hold a firm opinion against the idea of some kinds of jobs is being unevenly paid because the pressure from each kind of profession is equivalent to their income. Moreover, the impact on society as well as the amount of money a business can gain shall be the critical factors in terms of one’s earning."
10907,Full time university students need a lot of time to study . However these students also need to be involved in other activities . To what extent do you agree and disagree .,"Students always want to have a successful career . I do not agree when students only study that they do not enjoy other kind of activities . Ċ Nowadays , students spend hours each day studying at home because of these reasons . First , academic qualification are required in many profession . For example , it is impossible to become a doctor , teacher without having the relevant degree . Secondly , the job market is increasingly competitive . There are hundred of application for a position in a company . Young people who not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete . This means that the most students put great effort for a long time . Ċ However , students ought to learn to enjoy other kind of activities . They cant not sit only at home and learn . They can increase the risk of obesity , cancer . In addition , they live only in the world with books and computer and it lead to isolating people . People are willing get to involved in sports . In this way , they can reduce stress and improve our health . Moreover, they take part in other activities . They expand their knowledge in subjects and find interesting . The result of this is that they gain practice experience and learn real skills that it is very necessary for their future .

10908,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People behave differently when they wear different clothes. Do you agree that different clothes influence the way people behave? Use specific examples to support your answer.,"Some people from past until now spend high amount of money for clothes. Since it is very significant for people who are care for looking. I believe that there are different views about if clothes change people behaviors . From my opinion, I believe that clothes might change people behaver for two reasons. Ċ First, Changing behaver are kind of respect for high clothes. Some people believe if you wear high class clothes, you have to change your personality to match with your dresses .For instance, every year my mother's family have meeting, and in this meeting women wear expensive clothes, and their behaviors are different. They look very serious. It affected me because some of women I know their attitude when they don't were these dresses. I asked them for reasons of changing behaviors, they told me that because it respects for dresses to have artificial behaver. As we can see, if women don't wear theses kind of clothes, they will not change their behaviors. Ċ Second, some companies require for their employs to change their behaviors when they wear work suit. Companies are care about their customer; thus, worker have to be more polite. For example, One day I visited my brother who works in hotel. I was very surprised because his behaviors very different .To illustrate, my brother likes to make jokes and to be funny, but he looks serious in his job. As we see, my brother would not change his behaver if he doesn't wear a suit. Ċ In sum, people have different behaviors when they were quality clothes. For two reasons, people believe that when you were clothes' high value, you should respect that by changing your behaviors. Another reason, companies require for employs to adopt their behaviors during work. Everyone should keep their real attitude."

Do you agree or disagree,"These days , the number of persons who procrastinate in their daily activities increased dramatically . Some people argue that this habit is one of the main barriers to not achieve success in life . I completely agree with this view and think that it may engender diverse serious problems to humans . Ċ Firstly, it is well known that this unfavourable practice tends individuals to waste their and therefore their lives . In other words, when a person , who has a specific mission to accomplish, prefers to paste his age into imperfect activities instead of doing his work , wastes his moment that it could be investing in something meaningful. For example , according to a recent study on time management , people who usually procrastinate , find many problems managing their time and ignore their value . Thus ,this way of behaviour tends to push the population to spend their life in unhealthy habits . Ċ Secondly, It is clear that this tendency blocks people to live their dreams and in some cases to lose them. To put it differently , procrastination can obstruct individuals to make the right decision and miss the chances to be better in the future because they do not have the willpower enough to take every available opportunitiesChange to a singular nounopportunityThe singular quantifier every is followed by the plural noun opportunities. Consider changing the noun to the singular or using a different quantifier. Ċ show examples in their lives . For instance , researchers show that college students, who are procrastinated in doing tasks , do not achieve good grades in their exams and do not sucess to attend the university that they are interested them . That's why this useless practice can cause to miss the dreams and the goals of persons in the long term . Ċ In conclusion , I strongly believe that procrastination has plenty of negative consequences to the population because it causes waste of age and opportunities ."

Ċ One evident benefit is that it gives additional financial benefit and a person can enjoy various work atmosphere. In other words, working in more than one job definitely multiplies salary as well as provides better and convenient provinces. Another reason that multitasking could be advantageous is that it enhances public relations which further add to the marketing benefit for the job. For instance, my cousin Karan works for P& G company in the morning shift and for a coaching class in the evening that made him develop a huge list of contacts and he uses them for his personal venture of men's parlour. Ċ On the other hand, it becomes tedious and troublesome sometimes to the extent that a person may lose a good job or may suffer from mental and physical health issues. In addition to that changing jobs could not essentially be nice for getting a promotion or incentives. To exemplify, Mr Singh, my neighbour frequently shifts his job, hence he always find difficulty in getting promoted. Moreover, the people, who work for more than a year get more remuneration than him irrespective of the fact that they are his juniors. Ċ In conclusion, while there are plus points of doing more jobs and job shifting often, too much could be lost as a result. Maintaining a perfect balance is incredibly essential for stability and credibility."
10913,Many people lose their income due to CoVid19 pandemic. What solution that can do by government or individual to overcome this problem.,"According to coronavirus-19 outbreaks worldwide, some countries put the effort to tackle the circumstance by spending more funds and lockdown that effect to failure of the economic system, making reduce household revenue. Besides this situation, the essay will offer some solutions to get deal with the issue by both governments and people. Ċ The main problem of lockdown nation is the struggle of international business, especially tourism and export industries, it means that some population who have ever been working in relative this business, receiving effect on unable sales product like the same. Therefore, reducing family revenue can be alleviated by first having support from the government. Consequently, the Prime Minister should be mention in the effective management in crisis situations and monitored by heard some voices from their people. For example, the determination policy should be lockdown in some areas and decrease the rate of taxes for helping the person who lacks money using in daily life. Ċ Another equally vital solution is the collaborative of individual and private organisation sessions to inhabit the outbreaks of COVID and the creation of alternative careers for unemployed people. The new normal lifestyle of the community can be seen and maybe occurred new job in the era. Because individual should keep social distancing method that effects to the difficulty of increase more money and communicates by face to face. The huge funds by the major organisations can ameliorate by play an effective role as owner of a new industry in the country. For instance, the application for shopping online and cheaper delivery can employ new merchant and some graduates to link this business and develops sustainable jobs onward. Ċ To sum up, the issue needs to immediately improve throughout collaboration not only governments or some organisations but also all citizens to stop the widespread of COVID-19. Moreover, the problem should be addressed by developing sustainable employment in each country in order to not rely on just only international industries."
10914,Many people think there is a general increase of anti-social behavior and a lack of respect to others. What do you think are the causes of this and how to improve the situation ?,"Nowadays, many people believe that there is an increase in crimes and disrespect in society. In this essay, I will discuss the probable causes and solutions to cater to these issues. Ċ Firstly, Television and virtual media be considered as the major factor for cultivating violence among citizens. In order words, they are highly influencing individual towards gruesome anti-social behaviour and disrespect towards each other. For instance, Television shows such as Game of Thrones, which promotes crime, bloodbath and hatred are greatly viewed , especially among children, creating a negative example for them. The solution can be to control these contents. Parents can control the channels viewed by their children, as well as government can motivate individual for self- discipline as well as indulge in creative activities to create a healthy mind, which can be done by opening more gym, park and recreational activities. Ċ Secondly, non- availability of proper education at a primitive stage can also be the major reason for crimes and lack of respect among people,especially in the younger generation. This is because proper schooling provides a better life and sense of responsibility among community members, but the lack of it takes a human being in the wrong direction. The major reason for not having proper education is the high fee required to attend schools , which results in a majority of Individuals not able to even clear higher secondary schools. The solution to this problem is free education for all. For example, Canada and Germany provide free educations and scholarships to its citizens, which results in low crime rate in their countries as well as indulging in cultivating a civilised community. Hence, by providing free education, the problem of high crime rates and uncivilization can be stopped. Ċ In conclusion, by controlling the content in Television and internet either by self-control or by parents keeping the tab on children, as well as providing free education to everyone, crimes and disrespect, which is prevalent in society can be considerably decreased."
10915,At universities and colleges sports and other social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial supports.,"It is undeniable that social activities like sport are popular topics which have caused heated debate over a long period of time because they affect everybody in his daily lives. Depending on personal experience, personality type, and emotional concern, people differ greatly in their attitudes towards this issue. We find that some people hold the idea that sports and social activities are very important just like the other courses at university; on the contrary, others maintain that we shouldn't waste the money for these kinds of activities. From my point of view, social activities at universities or colleges are as important as other classes and should receive equal financial support. There exist countless factors which influence this opinion; two of those are the effect of social activities on student's characters and the other is the feeling of comfort and relaxed that the students will receive by doing social activities. Ċ The main aspect to point out is that doing social activities make a strong effect on student's personality. it can improve their confidence and make them ready to deal with the problems they may have during their study and also they will be learned very efficiently by working in groups and being in touch with other students. Ċ A further more subtle point is that by doing social activities specially sports, students feel fresh and they are more relax and comfort. Students who do these activities have fewer errors in their job at university. for example when I was at university we have sport class every Saturday I was very excited the day before my class and I felt really fresh when it got finished. Ċ From what has been discussed above, we may finally reach the conclusion that social activities and sports are just as important as classes and other courses and universities and colleges should spend equal money to develop them."
10916,Some students think that internet-based lectures is better type of lectures. The other tend to believe that University-based lectures is still needed. Explain both sides and give your opinion.,"These days due to the Covid pandemic, most education centersChange the spellingcentresThe spelling of centers is a non-British variant. For consistency, consider replacing it with the British English spelling. Ċ show examples tend to conduct their classes on online platforms. Although this method has become pervasive, there are still arguments about it among pupils who are supporters and those who are against this approach. I, personally, believe both online and face-to-face classes are imperative for an education system. Ċ On the one hand, I think online classes have revolutionized the education system. Firstly, by attending virtual classes, students have gotten rid of location restrictions imposed by the traditional types of classes. It means there is no obligation for knowledge seekers to participate in classrooms because by using a high-tech device like a laptop, they can access the class easily from everywhere. Secondly, attending online classes may lead to some environmentally-friendly results. For instance, by avoiding participating in physical classrooms, the proportion of transportation will decrease and it will result in less fume emission into the air; moreover, the traffic volume will be lowered. Finally, I believe online classes may make students become more familiar with state-of-the-art technologies that help them not to lag behind their peers all around the world. Ċ On the other hand, in my opinion, the beneficial aspects of face-to-face classes cannot be neglected. One of these advantages is that by attending university classrooms, students can boost their social interactions and interpersonal skills. As an example, pupils who discuss different attitudes about an issue, of course in a polite and academic situation, will acquire a wide range of abilities to be assertive rather than aggressive in the same circumstances. Another positive point is that some learners, who are at the tertiary education level, need to take in their lessons in a classroom with the presence of the teacher. I remember my classmates during the Master of Science degree who used to discuss one issue or difficulty in a curriculum. This discussion could be highly demanding if it was an online course. Ċ In conclusion, some students are big fans of online classes; however, there are other learners who argue that face-to-face classes cannot be altered by virtual ones. From my perspective, both of these methods are like two wings for the education system to develop and progress."
10917,With a fast pace of modern life more and more people are turning towards fast foods for the main meals? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"In this contemporary era, everything is going to change because of technology. Eating habits also have been changed in this modern life and people like to take fast food in their daily routine. According to my, both benefits and drawbacks are at the same place which I will explain in the following paragraphs. Ċ In the beginning, prons will be disputed in this paragraph. First and foremost, in this fast life, masses have a hectic schedule and sometimes, they do not have enough time to make meals for their families, that's why they prefer to buy foods from restaurants which are the easiest or time-consuming way. Moreover, it is a good business to get profit because youngsters like to have western foods especially at birthday parties, functions, picnic and on get together as well. Ċ On the contrary side, it has many cons to have these meals. Firstly, these types of foods are very oily which are not good for health and could be the reason for some diseases like sneeze, cough and other neck or stomach problems. Furthermore, obesity is the most dangerous malady that could be happened by this meal. For instance, the bread and the burger are the main sources of fat. It has been searched that mostly, in the developed countries, individuals are used to taking fast foods for their daily routines which are not good for health. In spite of, this food has negative effects for pregnant lady, sick person etcetera. Ċ In the conclusion, no doubt, fast food is unhealthy that can create many complications in our body but still it is the most popular in every age persons. It is not bad if we are having in some occasions or festivals because it is good to change the taste."
10918,IELTS task 2 Most of the world's poor live in countries where tourism is a growing industry. The issue is that tourism does not benefit the poorest. How can the income generated by tourism benefit the poor? And how can we ensure that tourism does not destroy traditional cultures and ways of life?  Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience,"Tourism is arguably a financial source for poverty in developing countries. Such growing industries have resulted from exploiting natural resources ranging from mountains to beaches and even mangrove forests to be successful in national income. However, this comes to two serious questions of the beneficial effects for poor people as well as the consequences on traditional cultures and ways of life. Ċ The general view has been that booming tourism in low-income countries play a crucial role in improvement of financial status. Reduction of unemployment rate, for example, is a primary result to help create jobs for under-privilege citizens. In addition, profitable income from this sector can enhance not only for education, but also for health care system and, in turn, it leads to contribution for higher standards of living of their citizens. Ċ Despite the fact that tourism attract loads of multicultural travelers, this can bring about an interesting situation of cultural merge and subsequently takes risk of loss their national identity. It is therefore essential for authorities to take responsibilities to encourage their people to make use of their culture and customs as an alternative way to achieve their tourism goal. In addition, the governments should promote their cultural values by mass media to maintain these precious things in their communities. Ċ To sum up, business tourism is of crucial importance of both increasing people's income and funding for other public sectors such as education and health care. On the other hand, loss of national identity should be highly considered so that the governments should not only represent their unique cultures as another source for tourist attraction, but also give priority to retain this national assets in the way of broadcasting."
10919,"Education is not a luxury, but a basic human right and as such should be free for everyone irrespective of personal wealth. Do you agree or disagree?","In the present age, education has become one of the most prominent factors in every country across the world. Some people assert that it has to be free as it is the basic right of an individual. I agree with this notion that primary education has to be available for all children irrespective of their financial status .The upcoming paragraphs will analyze two factors that contribute to this affirmation, as well as my personal opinion. Ċ Firstly, education made available to each and every child will help the reduce child labour rate. This is because poor pupils cannot afford to pay hefty school fee, as a result, their children do not get educated and start working at a young age to help their parents. For instance, In India, villagers do not earn handsome wages to send their children to school, instead, they make them work to earn more money for home resulting in child labour. If the education is provided without cost, then these toddlers can attend school. So it could be stressed that making education free of cost can help the poverty class to get educated. Ċ Secondly, early education can help children to become to create a better society in the future. For example, if people are educated, then they will not perform or support the crime as they will be aware of the consequences which they would have studied in academic law books. In other words, education can simply help a person to become a responsible citizen of the country. Hence, observing such instances it could be said that free education can also lead to a civilized society. Ċ In conclusion, it is undeniable that education is the most effective weapon to make society safe and wealthy. Therefore, it can be said that making education free can certainly benefit the economy."
10920,Some people think that women should not be allowed to work in the police force. Do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt that women are being employed in an increasing number in workplaces these days. However, some individuals still believe that women should not work in the police department. I do not agree with the statement, and will discuss about it in the essay. Ċ First of all, criminals can be either males or females, and it is better to employ female officers to catch female culprits. This is because many female offenders have accused the policemen of sexual harassment; thus, they feel more secure in the presence of woman personnel. A 2017 survey report conducted by an NGO in India suggested that 2 to 10% of female offenders complained of sexual harassment against male staff. Moreover, women are more comfortable with the same gender officers while taking driving tests. Ċ Another important point to consider in favour of the employment of the lady staff in law enforcement authorities is to promote the idea of women empowerment. In the countries like India, where the crime - rate against women is still higher, these measures could prove fruitful in the future. The reason is that these services involve physical training due to which they start feeling stronger, and their self-esteem would uplift. Therefore, the women should be empowered and should be given equal opportunity as men to work if they have essential qualification and skills, Ċ In conclusion, although there are different opinions of people regarding the lady personnel, steps like these would empower women and help them gain confidence to stand for their rights. I believe that it is vital to take such steps to support the idea of gender equality, and also strengthen the position of women in the society."
10921,Increases in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. Why is this the case? What can be done to solve this problem?,"In the modern world, the generation of products has been increasing with the demand of the growing population. It is believed that the rise in the creation of products leads to the destruction of the natural habitat. This essay will illustrate the solution to overcome this difficulty. Ċ First of all, The main reason for the damage is Global warming. Global warming can be controlled by decreasing pollution, like Air pollution, it is mostly caused by the release of harmful gases in the atmosphere from industries, and, by the gases released from vehicles. Moreover, Factories should not decompose their Industrial waste into the water which may affect the marine ecosystem. For example, To prevent water pollution Government of Hyderabad has banned the citizens from throwing harmful waste into any rivers, further, they even banned the idols from decomposing into lakes. Besides, this government is making a special site where they can decompose easily. By doing such activities, minor control over the damage can be done. Ċ On the other hand, As the population, has been increasing the demand for living and food is also growing. To fulfil their needs flora and fauna have been affected by them. Nowadays, humankind is cutting down the forest to build homes for the people in contrast to this animal life is also destroying. Many of the animals have become extinct due to deforestation. However, some of the forests have been destroyed by natural disasters, for instance, in Sydney and Turkey where the forest has caught fire and it goes on for several months which tends to cause damage to both flora and fauna. Ċ In conclusion, constitutions should build up certain rules and regulations which should be followed by every citizen of the country. Similarly, Human beings should limit the use of modern technology to prevent the devastation of living creatures and ozone layer depletion can occur which may ruin the human world."
10922,"In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?","The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense. Ċ With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative. Ċ Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems. Ċ In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life."
10923,"In many countries, more and more young people are leaving schools and unable to find jobs after graduation. What do you think youth unemployment will cause to the individual and the society? And make some suggestions.","People born in the 1980s and 1990s, unlike the ""baby boomers"", are having a hard time finding employment after they graduate from universities due to the global financial crisis. For instance, less than 50% of the young people in Spain are employed, while their counterparts in Greece have even worse luck. Ċ The high youth unemployment creates trouble not only for the individuals but also for the society. For individuals, unemployment leads to lower self-esteem and increased mental stress, not to mention the financial difficulty unemployment brings. Furthermore, if young people cannot find jobs after they left school, they may feel lost and lose hope for their future. For society, mass youth unemployment places a heavy burden on the welfare system and can even lead to social unrest. Ċ I suggest three ways to battle youth unemployment. First, we should encourage companies to recruit more young graduates by giving them tax breaks incentive. For instance, the UK government has already introduced such rules that the companies are entitled to lower tax rate when they take on a certain number of young apprentice. Second, we should introduce more practical courses and even internships in schools where young people can horn their practical skills so that they become more attractive in the job market. Finally, we should keep encouraging young unemployed people to hunt for jobs and offer mock interview service so that they do not lose heart. Ċ Youth unemployment is a social problem, and we should do all we can to battle this problem."
10924,"Which extra-curriculum activity do you think is the best activity for students? Joining a sports team, b. participating in community activities, or traveling?","The extra-curriculum activity is a regular part of students' life, which can prevent teenagers from falling into criminal or undesirable activities such as teenage-sex or drug-taking. While I accept that students have profited from community activities or travelling, I believe that taking part in a sports team is the best way for students. Ċ On the one hand, community activities and travelling have brought benefits to students. In community life, youngsters participate in a wide range of activities, ranging from the Christmas party to community services, which require students to communicate with neighbors and even organize activities. Thereby, youths obtain lots of opportunities to exercise interpersonal skills while playing and working. Furthermore, it has been proved that travelling can profoundly broaden adolescents' horizon. If a student have traveled to Japan, he or her can have a better understanding of what the Tokyo is like and how to communicate with Japanese, compared with simply studying in textbooks. Ċ However, I would argue that a sport team would bring about more benefits to participators. Firstly, adolescents can improve their physical fitness in sport games. For example, basketball is a physical activities highly require flexibility, response capabilities and coordination of mind and body, all of which are important capabilities outside the sport stadiums. In addition, sport can exercise youths' willpower and endurance. We have seen that students with strong these personalities are more likely to success because they can never be impeded by temporary failures. Lastly, sports can greatly foster youngsters' team spirit which is very importantly beneficial for youths as long as they are in group, no matter in school or society, Ċ In conclusion, it seems that joining in a sport team is the best activities outside class because it can enable students to increase fitness, exercise willpower and understand the importance of team spirit."
10925,The prevention of health problems and illness is more important than treatment and medicine. Government funding should reflect this Ċ To what extent do you agree?,"To curb any illness, preventing it, is the first step. It is argued that the government should spend to take preventive measures . I totally agree with the statement because precautionary measures are more economical in improving the well being of public and these methods must be funded by the government. In this essay, the importance of funding preventive methods will be discussed. Ċ To begin with, prevention is better than cure and requires fewer finances to improve the health of the public. If the illness is contained without the need for expensive medications, a lot of people’s money could be saved which could be used to address the other issues of the nation. As a result, both the mass and the state benefit from it. For example, a study done by the University of Cambridge, England eludes that the authorities can save almost 7% of the funds by taking the precautions to avoid illnesses like Dengue and Malaria. Thus, averting is economical both for the state and citizens. Ċ Furthermore, the authorities must allocate funds for precautionary measures to alleviate the burden on health services. Prevention costs less than the treatment itself which is the most compelling reason to invest in it. Therefore, with little funding, a big chunk of the state’s budget could be saved. For instance, a survey conducted by the University of Oxford, United Kingdom shows that the government have to spend 10% more to treat the disease which could be prevented with just 2% of that amount. Hence, it is beneficial for the state to fund precautionary methods. Ċ In summary, prevention is better than medicine economically and the authority's funds must reflect their interest in it."
10926,It is as important to teach children to protect the environment as it is to teach them to read and write. Ċ To what extent do you agree with this statement? Ċ Give reasons for your answers and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is argued nowadays whether to take lessons of protecting the environment as seriously as literary lessons on the young generation. I totally agree with the idea to put them of equal importance because many benefits can be seen on that. Ċ People who think highly of reading and writing skills may think they are essential for the development of the young population. As two fundamental tools, reading and writing are more likely to be used in academic learning as students skim, scan words for further thinking and then write down their thoughts as the output. What's more, every day we can't live without typing and reading messages in order to socialize with others, in which the two basic skills are all needed. However, if we don't spend time keeping in touch with our environment and ignore its needs and the harm it suffers, we may lose our home where we humans live. This seems to be more essential for all of us. Ċ Thus, teenagers should be taught and then be aware of the importance of environmental protection. Firstly, they should make themselves clear of what behaviours are beneficial to our living places. For example, litter classification was really a problem when it was first introduced in Shanghai. Citizens hadn't been taught any of the relevant knowledge in schools before so that it was truly hard for them to classify between recycled litter and litter for no use anymore. On the contrary, the Swiss people perform much better as everyone in the nation is told how to do so even as a child. Secondly, young scholars should know the results of doing harm to the earth. Many natural disasters actually are caused by humans' misbehaviours. For instance, we are now suffering more from extreme weather, which is led by global warming as a result of too much emission of greenhouse gases. The more we drive our cars powered by gases, the more we expose ourselves to dangers like floods, storms, dry, etc. Ċ In conclusion, protecting the global village where we and our generations in the future have to depend on is as necessary as other learning pathways. Measures should be taken to arouse people's awareness."
10927,Many students find it difficult to learn subjects like mathematics and philosophy and hence they should be optional in schools. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? both Mathematics and Philosophy are useful subjects,"Learn by heart is the most common way for learning the many subjects, but, this method does not always go with maths and philosophy as these subjects mainly depend on logical thinking and broad understanding. This situation makes them more difficult and incomprehensible for many students. However, I strongly believe that making them optional in the school syllabus would not be a smart decision as at least the basic concepts of these subjects need to be learned to get on with the life. Ċ Firstly, Mathematics is one of the most important subjects which is frequently using in our day to day life, and most of the mathematical concepts can practically apply to several real-world problems. Similarly, knowledge in mathematics is crucial for several professional fields such as engineering and management, therefore lots of career opportunities available around the globe for people who have extensive knowledge of mathematics. Ċ Likewise, Philosophy also considered as one of the essential subjects for improving the logical thinking and inner qualities of a person. Unlike other subjects, philosophy not targets to any professional specific skills, but it helps to change the thinking style of the person to make an outstanding personality. Philosophy can improve discipline and leadership qualities which play an essential role in being a successful person. Ċ However, It is true that not everyone needs to be experts in mathematics or philosophy and the choice of selecting the future career is a personal choice. But from my point of view, making them mandatory in school level would not make any unfavorable influence on child's ambition, as they can choose preferred paths at the tertiary level education targeting their future career. Ċ In short, I tend to believe that the both Mathematics and Philosophy are kinds of useful subjects and every child should have at least basic knowledge about them."
10928,"Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?","Humans will change by events they have gone over. Some people tell that students will be influenced by their experiences when they are a child. However, others say that experiences when they have grown up, especially at school, will affect them the most. In my point of view, both experiences have a huge influence on their lives. Ċ On the one hand, kids tend to repeat behaviors from other people. For example, if we treat our babies softly, they will act the way we did for them. By contrast, if kids see their parents altercate often, they will become a hot-tempered person. In addition, playing puzzle or any toys help them develop their brand to become smarter when they grow up. Finally, the habits of children also reflect their personality and interests. For instance, a kid who plays with car models tends to be big on cars and explore them a lot in the future. Ċ On the other hand, knowledge adolescent is taught at school play a very important role in their lives. Although teenagers were taught by their parents when they were children, however, they can develop in various ways. Therefore, school is where adolescents can be directed in the right way. At school, teachers create plenty of conditions to help improve their missing skills as well as develop their strong points. Ċ In conclusion, in my opinion, children need to be educated in the correct way during the period from a kid to an adult because all of those experiences will influence what kind of human they will be."
10929,"Difference between countries have become less evident so we can enjoy the same films,brands and TV program, to what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantage?","Currently, globalization has become a general tendency. The links between different countries and considerably close and cultures of various nations has become similar. Consequently, people over the worldwide can share the same books films, brands, books and TV programs. I believe that the disadvantages exceed the advantages. Ċ Admittedly, the same cultural input significantly contributes to remove the barriers for communication between different countries, which is an effective way to promote the understand and interaction between nations that are different culturally. As a result,base on the similar understanding , the tensions and conflicts caused by misunderstanding would decline. Nevertheless, under large extent, the same input results the similar output, which means no matter how far away a country may be geographically, no country is really differing. The world has become monotonous and boring, restricting people's vision. Meanwhile, there is a dramatic decrease in cultural diversity because of this. Ċ In addition, cultural assimilation id more likely to cause more server problems. The first one is the mainstream culture could quickly occupy the market.without hard efforts. As a sweep trend, a great number of people tend to follow it . Gradually , individuals' thinking pattern and living habits are changing due to the effect of mainstream culture. More worsely, many people especially the youngsters will lost the respect for traditional culture, and even be shame of the traditions. Therefore , it may largely erode the cultural and national identity,making traditional culture die out at last. Ċ In conclusion, although the assimilation improves the communication between different countries., it renders the world monotonous and cause the extinction of traditional culture, whose weaknesses outweigh the strengthenes."
10930,Haven listened the advice of Introduction related to thesis statement and the length. Will this essay be better? THX~~ Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. Do you agree or disagree?,"Confronted the situation that girls tend to learn arts while boys choose sciences considerably, educators begin to concern about the imbalance of male and female graduates in each major. In order to control this phenomenon, a suggestion that the number of every college class should be the same in gender has been put forward. Personally, I do not think it is a feasible plan-for two reasons. Ċ Scientific research has been proved that different gender has various personalities. In spite of several repetitions in identical work, female students could do patiently as usual. In contrast, males are fairly curious about everything around them, lacking perseverance to do the same thing. Therefore, dancing, for example, will be one of the most unwilling options among boys. If universities are required to have the same boys and girl through all subjects, the interest of learning would fade gradually as girls may be thought themselves as losers after being defeated several times by boys in physical or chemistry exams. Ċ In addition, the human right is granted man and woman to have equal right to accept education. No matter which subject it is, girls and boys are eligible to choose and be accepted. From college perspective, the choice of each student should be respected, regardless of the number of males and females. Only when the university could be student-oriented, could the college be named as the platform to cultivate the talented. Ċ Consequently, I take the view that universities could advocate the gender balance among majors, but should not implement rigidly and disobey the willingness of students."
10931,Libraries are irrelevant in the age of the internet and should not be publicly funded. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is a fact that the internet is in an outstanding position as it used globally in this era of advanced technology. This has caused many people to think that funding the public libraries is inappropriate. In my opinion, I firmly disagree with the aspect to stop financing the public libraries because they are convenient and socially important for every community. Ċ First and foremost, libraries offer ease and comfort to the community. Although the internet has provided wide access to online materials from the comfort zone of home, some people still prefer to use libraries because they are technophobes and do not have good command to operate electronics equipment. In Viet Nam, for example, the majority of senior citizens prioritize libraries because, for them, it is uncomfortable to concentrate over mobile phones for longer hours and they could not operate advanced features of their mobile phones. Therefore, it seems to me that libraries should remain in existence and properly financed. Ċ Communication is another advantage that public libraries provide. These days the ubiquity of online platforms, particularly, social networking sites is prone to take people’s precious time, which may eventually lead to isolation from the society. Thus, public libraries would serve as a provision of gathering place for everyone in person. In other words, if citizens interact with each other who have the same interests, they will have a sense of community. Furthermore, it is likely that the youth can improve their social skills which will definitely help them this virtue to apply for a job by attending to the libraries instead of spending their whole time on the online platform. Ċ In conclusion, although there are some people who are of the opinion that libraries are not needed, I believe that libraries are an essential asset to provide resources which are trustworthy and to make people more sociable. Moreover, it is easier for some people to use libraries rather than innovative technology."
10932,"In general, people are living longer now than before. Discuss the causes of the recent increase in life expectancy. Use specific reasons and detail to develop your essay.","With the development of medical technology and knowledge, people nowadays can live much longer than they used to. There are various reasons why the people's lifespan has prolonged and two of which will be listed below. Ċ Firstly, as the process of technology has contributed to the medical equipment and treatment in recent years, the medical standard in the society has leveled up gradually. Many diseases are no longer incurable. Diagnosed at earlier stage, some of terminal diseases like cancer are predictable under doctor's control. Moreover, current technology allows human beings' organs to be transformed from one body to another,which considerably decreasing the mortality of human beings. Ċ Secondly, it is true that the affairs related to elderly people are intensively taken into account by the government and the society facing the soaring rate of senior citizens' population. The welfare formulated by the authorities provides practical fundings to elderly people, such as sickness pay or annual subsidy, which financially assisting them a lot. Ċ In addition, many organizations and individuals in the society give a boost to the establishments of nursing homes. The proliferation of it in the society gives a big aid of taking care of senior citizens. The sound and suitable facilities and qualified staffers with medical knowhow in the nursing home help elders to live a life easierly in this well-prepared place. Ċ In conclusion, it is clear to see life expectancy is longer then the past. Advances in medication, officially welfare in funding and locally nursing houses are the explanations for this trend."
10933,space exploration versus people problems on the earth Question: Some governments spend a lot of money on exploring space. Some feel that this investment is justified while others think that money should be spent on public services like healthcare and education. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In the age of exploration, billions of dollars have been spent on space travels, services and equipment. However, many people claim that government is just squandering and they better invest in public services such as healthcare and education. In my opinion, improving citizens' life should be given more prioprity. Ċ On the one hand, people advocate for budget on public services because most of it comes from citizens' income and their life quality is great of importance. Inhabitants want to receive good healthcare system where they can obtain modern and effective treatment services. Besides, a thriving country comes form an outstanding education. If they invest more in constructing schools or developing future labor resources, the literacy will be increased. Therefore, the awareness of people are enhanced and the country is likely to develop at faster speed. Ċ On the other hand, space exploration assists people to keep track with information and contemporary world. Since the end of World War 2, every powerful country have tried their best to come first in term of space discovery or telegraph technology. As a result, budget on these areas is a necessary. However, it can not come before people's welfare. The major responsibility of a government is obviously facilitating it's inhabitants' life. Once this task is completed, then can it think about the another. Ċ In conclusion, space exploration takes up billions of dollars due to the competition of powerful countries, while budget on improving people's welfare is believed to lead to nation's growth. I suppose budget on space exploration comes after public services because of government's responsibility."
10934,"Today more and more people are using computers and electronic devices to access information. Thus, there is no need to print newspapers, books, or magazines anymore. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the modern world, electronic apparatus plays an important role in human’s life. Nowadays, many people are using electronic gadgets and computers to read the information that is happening around them. It leads to the non-requirement of printed newspapers, magazines, and book. While I agree that the usage of mobile phones by adults increases enormously, still many old people prefer to read only printed papers. Ċ On the one hand, the young generation uses mobiles as their primary device for reading and to know the information that needs to understand. They can access all websites, and anything can be downloaded from them or can be read online. In addition, it is user friendly and easy to keep in pockets. For example, it can be carried anywhere easily wherever we go. Moreover, the waiting time is eliminated if someone wants to know the current affairs. As a result, the time saved. Ċ On the other hand, older people face issues in operating mobile phones as they prefer only printed papers. This is mainly because many are not educated and do not have an idea of how to operate it. In addition to this, some have visual difficulties, thus usage of electronic devices continuously may lead to irritation on their eyes. For instance, still many newspapers and magazines are being purchased by those people. Also, quite a lot of books are being ordered online. So, the older population never get affected by electronic devices. Ċ To conclude, although mobile phones are preferred by young people for reading and various purposes, it is showing that still, the part of the society continue to use the paper-based newspapers, magazines, and books. The technological development in electronic devices will not replace printed papers."
10935,Some people think the main purpose of education is to make individuals useful to society; others say education helps them to achieve personal ambitions. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In recent years, education had a significant role to enhance personal development, especially in terms of social contribution to the neighbourhood. Diametrically opposed to this, some opine that the benefit of attending formal lectures is only related to individuals' aims. In my opinion, however, all aspects that people learn from school contribute to social awareness improvement which can be implemented to address social issues in society. Ċ First and foremost, national education observers are concerned that the academy environment does not only provide students to alleviate their hard skills but also soft skills. In other words, pupils have the opportunity to absorb social skills from their extracurricular activities such as climate change clubs or student body organisations. For example, the youngster who has previously joined a volunteer programme at school are likely to conduct further community service when they come back to their local residents. This is because the level of empathy inside themselves has been developed significantly and bring up their interest in local issues. Ċ On the other hand, a number of the general public are considered that academic life will equip young people with essential abilities which only benefit for their personal future goals. Although they have obtained numerous insights from their teacher, they will absolutely prioritize their own objection like how to get a white-collar job and earn money. For instance, it is preferable for fresh graduates to find a proper occupation after they finished their higher studies rather than doing community service projects. If they do not start to make money as soon as possible, there will be no guarantee for them to survive in this capitalist system. Ċ To conclude then, sometimes people believe that schooling only generates individual benefit as pupils must focus on their own personal matters like their future financial circumstances or family problems. However, in my view, a multitude of new expertise they acquired during the formal learning process can be beneficial for society because they are used to practice their sympathy and empathy when it comes to public issues."
10936,Nowadays people are working too hard. What is the reason for that. What should employers do in order to prevent employees from this.,"The average amount of time spent in the office has increased significantly in the past couple of years. In 2020 alone it was over 70 hours a week not to mention the overtime one has to undergo to finish their tasks. There are numerous reasons as to why human beings work longer hours as well as solutions to the problem of reducing the burden of employees. This is essay will be dealing with the causes as to why individuals work as hard as they do and a suggestion to employers to mitigate the issue. Ċ Firstly, the most common reason why people work tirelessly is to acquire greater benefits from the company. These can include things like extra vacation, higher bonuses and a higher chances of landing a promotion. A survey conducted by Alphabet incorporation which is the parent company of Google has stated that 97% of its employees were inspired to perform better after receiving higher pay in the form of bonuses in addition to paid leaves. To combat the problem, corporations must make use of tools with higher productivity to improve the efficiency of labourers. In short, workers spend way too much effort working with unproductive equipment and can spend less effort on provided they find better tools to enhance their productivity. Ċ Secondly, another reason why labourers spend so much effort on their career is to ensure job security. Nowadays people have become much more competitive than the previous generation. As a result, they have become more vulnerable to the loss of their positions. For example, more than 65% of workers have become unemployed in the past few years. Senior management must make sure that their employees have the assurance that they will not lose their jobs for a fixed period of time and must negotiate a contract. In summary, job security has become a reason as to why people have been working hard lately and if staff make sure that their workers don’t have to be afraid of the issue then the time spent on their profession will be reduced. Ċ In a nutshell, one has been spending too many hours on their jobs not only because of the added benefits but also due to the over competitiveness of individuals. This issue can be mitigated provided that efficient tools are provided for individuals as well as assured job security."
10937,The media is increasing interest in famous people who have ordinary backgrounds. Why do you think people are interested in the lives of famous people? Do you think this is a good thing?,"The growing interest of the public to the celebrities without any outstanding backgrounds is being increasingly witnessed these days. In this essay, I shall discuss the main cause why this change has occurred and explain why I believe it could be a positive tendency once governments give proper guidance. Ċ There are numerous compelling reasons why this is happening and the prominent one is that people are always curious about how would successful individuals in various areas utilize their valuable time and maintain a work-life balance as some ideas and thoughts could be beneficial for the common people who wants to pursue a higher achievement in their life. For instance, a recent survey conducted in Japan has revealed that 80% of the people believe that paying attention on celebrity’s daily life enables them to keep themselves motivated because they want to be similar to the famous people. As a result, this tendency is currently increasing in recent years. Ċ Looking at this in a big picture, our society could be positively affected by this development. The crucial beneficial factor of this trend is that people with ordinary backgrounds can learn many valuable lessons from successful people, such as time management and improving productivity. Take myself for example, I have learnt many useful and beneficial skills, then find myself a real motivation to work harder in the future after knowing Jack Ma’s daily work schedule. As can be seen, this development has a profound impact on us. Ċ To sum up, the trend of people paying attention to famous people’s life is ubiquitous nowadays. This essay discussed the reason why it is happening and also explained why it could be a positive development for us."
10938,In many countries students take a year off after finishing school and work or travel during this period. Should students take a gap year before attending universities? What are the advantages and disadvantages of it?,"In this ambitious world, migration for education is becoming a trend among younglings. Many nations government inspires youngsters to do job or tour annually after completion of schooling and before admitting in an academy. In the forthcoming paragraph, this essay would elaborate on both pros and cons and exemplify with lucid examples. Ċ To begin with, if the student does an internship in foreign countries, then he would gain communication skills. Due to which he acquires the ability to give seminars in university. For example, while working in an organisation he faces customers which reduces hesitation. Moreover, he would be familiar with the culture of the country. This is the fact that one can learn moral values. consequently, in the recent ,survey the persons who had participated in such duties are more punctual than others. Ċ However, candidates who had taken a gap in studies are more conscious to make money rather than academics. Due to this, the distraction they are not concentrating upon their subjects. For instance, in order to become economically ,stable they are failing in their careers. Furthermore, many students are not bothering about their families and enjoying their lives independently. In other words, it creates disputes in their relationship with their parents. Exemplar, they are breaking the hopes and expectations of their parents. Ċ To conclude, not only students should focus on financial growth but also it is essential for them to be responsive towards their relationship with their parents."
10939,"Some people feel that it is always wrong to keep animals in captivity, for instance in zoos. Other people say that there are benefits for the animals and for humans. Discuss both sides and give your personal view. zoos - fun for humans, harm for animals?","Zoos are still the artificial environments where people visit to undergo the feeling of being in the short-term contact with the wildlife. While some people argue that it is cruel to keep them in such captivities, however, I believe that, it is beneficial for both the animals and the humans. Ċ On the one hand, zoos are considered as safe and peaceful places in some respects. In the wild, there are great probabilities that most animals can lose their natural habitat, or be killed by other animals. This is more beneficial particularly for endangered animals, which in turn can contribute to the ecosystem. Apart from this, as the natural places where animals can be very dangerous for the lives of human beings, most of us would not have the chance to encounter other living creatures without the presence of zoos. Ċ On the other hand, there are many who doubt the wholesomeness of the existence of zoos. As living in the limited space, the animals can suffer mentally and physically. For example, repetitive disorders and eating disorders seem in the zoo animals more frequently. Apart from not being healthy, some argue that zoos are unethical as they do not have the right to exploiting animals with the intention of making money. They also suggest that the best way to saving endangered animals is protecting their natural habitats. Ċ In conclusion, it seems to me that despite some negative sides, zoos have noticeable advantages for animals, as well as humans, as long as their rights and comforts are preserved."
10940,Some people advocate death penalty for those who committed violent crimes. Others say that capital punishment is unacceptable in contemporary society. Ċ Describe advantages and disadvantages of death penalty and give your opinion.,"It is true that capital punishments can protect a vulnerable society from future crimes. While some people argue that death penalties are unfair towards other human beings, others insist that violent criminals should be sentenced to death. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support of the former view. Ċ In contemporary society, many countries have abolished capital punishments. The death penalty can be unsuitable punishment for several reasons. First of all, the strongest argument is - people should not decide who can live and who cannot. Secondly, sentenced individuals are not always criminals. Thus, an innocent person can die which is very unfair. Last but not least, a life sentence is a more relentless punishment rather than a death sentence. To illustrate, criminals would suffer more if they had to spend their whole lives in prisons. Some prisoners long for sooner death. Ċ Alternatively, violent criminals can be dangerous even in prison territories. One criminal can take the lives of several other people. Therefore, it would be more preferable to eliminate future crimes by issuing the death penalty. Moreover, people in prisons are maintained on the government budget. More specifically, taxpayers' money is spent on supporting the lives of prisoners. For instance, these funds could be spent on improving the infrastructure of cities. Ċ To sum up, both ideologies have relevant advantages and drawbacks. However, I tend to believe that one human being does not have the rights to take the life of the other."
10941,"Levels of youth crime are increasing rapidly in most cities around the world. What are the reasons for this, and suggest some solutions. youngsters breaking the law","Recently, crimes committed by young ages have become topic of debates globally, bringing many concerns between government and society. The growing numbers have demonstrated the relevancy of this issue. Overall, this essay will point out reasons why the new generation are involved on this situation and provide some solutions. Ċ First and foremost, the main reason is clearly the freedom that children are growing up. Modern society allows young people to have more flexibility. For instance, while parents are working all day, their sons are being carried by other people such nannies or relatives, who in general neglected attention or have different ways to educate them. Therefore, young people, particularly teenagers are becoming far more independent to committ some crimes that they even are not aware of the consequences. Furthermore, a great solution to tackle this issue could be more presence of parent in children's daily life and also more discipline in their activities. Ċ The secondary reason for crime rates for early ages is the easy access to information. Media often have been showing videos, films and news explaining how people strategically performed in some kind of crimes such as violence and robbers. Moreover, it is encouraged by some groups on social media rapidly. A good idea it will be reinforce the time limit of children and teenagers on TV, internet or any budget, as a consequence less exposition and vulnerability. Ċ In conclusion, freedom and media access are main factors for problems with increased rates of crime in early ages. Parents are protagonist to solve this issue, who should be more present, monitoring the time and content available for their sons."
10942,Some people believe that having interviews is the best way to find new employees for a company. Others say that there are better alternative ways to appoint employees. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"While some people think that the best way to hire new employees for a company is an interview, others believe that there are some ways that are better. I will discuss both of these views and give my thoughts. Ċ To begin with, an interview has been used for many years when many companies want to find new employees. Some people think it is the best way possible. Additionally, it is also simple, does not take too much time, can be even less than an hour per candidate. Despite its simplicity, there are some drawbacks as well. For instance, many companies nowadays, especially in Thailand, just gather candidates’ information from their resumes. By this, some people can make up their profile to look good, so they can get hired by the company they want, hence a company may not get the best employees by only interviewing. Ċ On the other hand, some individuals argue that if employers want the best from their employees, there are better ways to do so and I agree. As far as I’m concerned, an interview might not be the best way to hire the right person for the job, some jobs may require more abilities than others, such as programming. Instead of interviewing, candidates should be given tasks to complete, which like what they have to do at the workplace, whoever can handle the task better will get the job. This might be one example, where the company should not rely only on traditional hiring methods. Ċ In conclusion, even though having interviews has been used to hire employees for decades and some people have been thinking that it is the most suitable for every job hiring process, there are other ways that might be better for some jobs as well. Executing a given task, for example, is one thing that can be done."
10943,"Crime rate in urban areas Prompt: Crime rate, in most countries, is often higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Why do you think that is? What can be done to reduce crime rate? Any advice or feedback would be appreciated.","In recent decades, escalating crime rate in many places, especially in metropolitan areas, has been receiving a great deal of media attention, causing public controversy. Although there are many reasons leading to the increase of criminals in these areas compared with the rural ones, some plausible solutions are there to tackle this headache-provoking problem. Ċ Of many main causes of crime in urbanized areas, poverty and addiction are basically what to blame. First, it has long been asserted that crime is an evitable product of poverty. In fact, in order to make ends meet under tremendous pressure of urban markets, many people will, by hook or by crook, do whatever it takes to earn their living even committing crimes. Second, big cities are often full of people who are addicted to either alcohol or drugs. When these people are on their way to chase high feelings, the likelihood of them committing crimes, such as robbery or even murder, is very high, and virtually nothing could hold their steps. Ċ However, by adopting cutting-edge technologies and building DNA databases, the governments could reduce substantially crime rate in urban areas. First, deterrent technologies are proven effective in decreasing urban thefts. For example, robbery in California has become less severe after the local authority installed more police cameras throughout the state. In addition, DNA databases also do the governments a great favor in combating criminals in metropolitan areas. Statistically speaking, by building labs which can add DNA of offenders, Malaysian governments are able to find criminals faster and more cost-efficiently than they did in the past. Ċ In conclusion, although there are many reasons that result in higher crime rate in urban areas than in the countryside, governments can invest in state-of the-art technologies to ultimately maintain security in big cities."
10944,"In some societies, fashion is becoming more and more important in choosing clothes. Why is it the case? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?","Some individuals argue that being more fashionable is important, particularly in choosing clothes. This is due to they put the appearance as a paramount value in their life. I personally believe that fashion leads people to positive way. Ċ In today society life, many people are undoubtedly spending their money for fashionable clothes. A host of dress styles created by designers and their works invite people to become trendy, stylish and good looking. In addition, some individuals even pay high cost a designer for a splendid dress which suit to their body for certain events such as wedding party and ceremony.  Thus, it is unquestionably true that choosing the best clothe is important for people's appearance. Ċ There are some positives effects of being fashionable in a daily life. Firstly, people will be more confidence by wearing their best dress in any occasion, for instance meeting up with a prominent person, attending birthday party and so forth. This is because they evidently comfort with their dress. Moreover, people will be braver showing in front of many people, especially for those who work as a motivator or public figure. As a result, people will experience their daily pursuit optimistically. Ċ In conclusion, fashion becomes more important in today's world. Wearing the best clothe in any occasion are able increasing a confidence value, therefore fashion is a positive development to foster people's personality."
10945,"Many people believe that a person's culture is defined by their country of origin., while others believe that it has only minor influence. discuss both views and give your opinion.","A group of people think that the personality of a person is merely dependsChange the verb formmerely dependsIt appears that the form of the verb depends does not work with is in this sentence. Ċ show examples upon their home country, whereas, a few other dissidents bring forward the notion that native places do not have much influence in their character formation. This essay explains both sides of this view, and why I think birthplaces have less role. Ċ People believe the birth nation has a huge role in setting an individual's culture, due to the following reasons. They believe that one's behaviour starts to develop when he/she is in the womb. Therefore, offsprings learn the culture, what they have experienced, even before they were born. People may have to travel abroad,however, they will obviously be connected to their roots, since they developed an emotional attachment with their birth place's culture. For example, Usha Uthup, a famous pop singer in India, even though, she spent most of her career journey in other nations, never lost her love towards India traditional attire. Due to these reasons, some believe that an individual's birthplace has a significant role in defining the culture. Ċ In the contrast to the above, others, including me, think that native location has solely a minor influence on behaviour development. To be precise, it has been evident that,humans are capable of adapting to nay different heritage easily. For instance, as a result of globalization, and the influence of western culture in local communities, cultural exchange is rapidly increasing, across the world. So, people are more likely to acquire foreign traditions, as they believe other nations' traditions aid them to gain global citizens' quality. Due to this trend in society, I believe native locations have less influence while defining the character of a person."
10946,"Some people believe that sport is an essential part of school life for children, while others feel it Ċ should be purely optional. Discuss these opposing views and give your own opinion. Ċ You should give reasons for your answer, and include ideas and examples from your own Ċ knowledge and experience.","Sports has been an integral part of school life.While there are some who believe that it is a crucial aspect of students' lives, others contend that it is not important and should not be forced on learners. Although there are a few merits of making sports optional, I strongly believe that it should be a mandatory part of every child's school life. Ċ To begin with, playing games and participating in athletics keep young learners physically and mentally fit. Constant running and jumping not only improves their cardio-vascular strength but also their hand-eye coordination and balance. One need look no further than popular sports like football and basketball. Players of these embody qualities such as agility, nimbleness, stamina, quick thinking and acute focus on a particular task. These qualities have a spillover in academics as well.They are found to better and resilient students; great strategizers with a logical bent of mind. Ċ However, others believe that sports are just adding to the burden and hence should be made optional. They argue that since students are already occupied with studies , it should be left to them to choose their own extra-curricular activities. Pushing sports onto them when they hate is only going to be detrimental for them. For instance, a child with a musical bent of mind would like to devote more time to hone her musical skills rather than play any game. Forcing her to devote more time to sports at the expense of her training in music will only serve to waste her talent. Thus, it is the student's prerogative to decide which activity she should choose. Ċ To conclude, sports in school is a highly divisive issue. While both the sides make compelling arguments, I believe it is best if sports is kept as a compulsory subject as it will be beneficial for student's mental and physical health. If sports are removed from the curriculum, the students will be poorer for it."
10947,"Nowadays many people prefer to study or live in foreign countries. While studying and living abroad brings many benefits to individuals, it also has a number of disadvantages. What are the advantages and disadvantages of leaving your country to live or study abroad? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","These days it is not unusual to witness an increasing number of people migrating to another country, either to study or to work. Most of them tend not to be hesitant to leave their comfort zones to immerse into another culture. From my own viewpoint, I believe that living abroad can be very challenging. Nevertheless, at the same time, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that ya person can bring with him in his next endeavour. Ċ To begin with, when moving to a foreign country,  one will find himself amazed by what its culture possesses to offer. This might be regardless if it is extremely dissimilar from what an individual is used to. Furthermore, it can be perceived in several ways, such as the different tourist attractions and its architecture, the way people socialize during gatherings and even in foods and delicacies. Undoubtedly, these can merely be the few concrete reasons why living overseas makes it fun and exciting. Another apparent advantage can be the fact that upon studying or working abroad, a person will be capable of improving his cross-cultural knowledge and skills. Consequently,  that could be a vital positive factor contributing to future job application, since most companies value international background and diversity to its employees. Ċ Turning to the other side of the argument, the particular thing that makes moving to an unfamiliar country terrible is the adaptation period. It is when expatriates face most of the challenges of living abroad including culture shock and homesickness. Some people might find it uncomfortable when being immersed in a completely unusual environment. A typical example of which is in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where women are prohibited to mingle with people of the other gender especially with the locals. Looking at the other disadvantage, homesickness might represent a general struggle, but others might experience it regardless of the number of years of being away from his family. However, technology makes it easier to connect someone to their loved ones, through the help of today's social media platforms. Ċ To sum up, moving and living overseas demonstrate its constructive and negative sides. In my opinion, the negatives can be immensely outweighed by the positives. Ultimately, this can be possible when someone appreciated the beauty of distinctive cultures and its people, aside from the gains, which can be acquired through experiences."
10948,Environmental problems are too great to be managed by individuals so real change can only be achieved at government level. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement? support your point of view with reasons and/or examples from your own experience.,"Our Planet is facing more environment challenges like never before. This can be seen more in urban cites due to industrialisation and is having major impact on living condition. It is believed that goverments should start to enforce policies such that entities that are causing problem to enviroment are controlled and suggest alternative best practice, where ever necessary. The two major issues causing promblem to our eco system is air pollution and soil contamination. Ċ Most of us are aware on impact of air pollution , However there is very contribution made to control it. For example in vasty populated city like Delhi, All prefer to use individual car to work place. This significantly raises carbon emmission and thereby has negative impact on everyone. In this case, government has a major role to in introducing effective public and some strict policies enforced like car pooling which will reduced the pollution levels. Ċ The second major concern for environment is the soil contamination. In india for instance farmers are over using the fertilisers for returns. This is causing health issues with fertiliser chemicals getting into human intake. Governments should help farmer provide subsidiary for organic farming and provide loans to sustain this kind of farming. This will help reduce soil contamination and lead to health intake. Ċ After discussing the major issues causing environment , It can be concluded that government action has more positive impact in bring down the problem, ofcourse the people have there bit to make . IT is also suggested there should be people and governorment jointly run initiatives to reduce the impact on damage on environment for better living conditions."
10949,"who needs English, Chinese or Russian language? Some people say that the only reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country. Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language.Which point of view do you agree with?","Learning a foreign language is becoming a trend worldwide.An increasing number of people suppose that people only learn foreign languages to work abroad and visit a foreign country.Others,however,argue that there are several other reasons explaining for this trend.In my opinion,i strongly agree with the later view. Ċ First and foremost,people learn foreign languages to satisfy their interest in linguistics.As we see,many people are passionate about languages.Therefore,they learn foreign languages as a way to pursue their passion.My father's case is a specific example.He has a great enthusiasm about languages and he has been learning four foreign languages. Ċ In addition,people learn foreign languages to broaden their knowledge.Learning foreign languages gives them opportunities to expose to different cultures,histories and traditions of other nations.As a result,they will gain useful information.For instance,when learning English,i can get knowledge about many things involving England such as English lifestyles or customs. Ċ I admit that many people learn foreign languages with a view to travel or work in foreign countries.However,it is only one reason among lots of reasons why someone should learn a foreign language. Ċ In conclusion,i believe that people learn foreign languages not only for traveling and working abroad but also for a lot of other reasons.People should take advantage of languages which they have learned to do other things rather than traveling and working."
10950,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ? Cars cause a lot of air pollution. Some people think drivers should pay an environmental tax to pay for the pollution caused by their cars.,"I strongly agree with the statement that drivers should pay an environmental tax to pay for the pollution caused by their cars. In my view, this payment is obviously their responsibility to pay for cleaning the environment and to support for environmental solutions research. Ċ One important problem with polluted environment is to purify it. This is encountering more and more difficulties, and ficancial problem is also among them. According to a 2007 survey by the TIMEs, due to car smoke, over 10 billion dollars must be paid for fixing pollution problems per a year, and this number is continuously raising. Therefore, people who use cars must to pay environmental tax in order to reduce this financial burden. Ċ In addtion, because serious pollution caused by cars smoke, researching for sollutions of environmental problems need to be intensified. This has also dealt with financial problems. There were much study of air pollution has stopped because of lacking research grant. Examples, Research of Air Pollution of Washington University, Research of Car Fumes of Japanese Pollution Organization and so on ... Of course, who can afford to drive a car should pay extra to support the research. Ċ To conclude, I completely approve people who drive cars should pay environmental tax to contribute to improving polluted environment, especially, in order for freshing the environment and supporting environment protection research."
10951,"In some cities, there is less control over the design and construction of new homes and office buildings. People can build in whatever style they like. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","Nowadays, Urban population is increasing rapidly across many countries. Though this is a good indication of economic development, some people are violating rules while constructing houses.In my opinion, the negative effects are more when compared to benefits because of this situation. Ċ More individuals are migrating to cities for survival and this trend is growing quickly.Though older generation individuals are still working in the countryside, youth are moving to cities for earning money.For instance, recent stats prove that many farmers are gradually migrating to urban areas, since cultivation has become hard due to poor rainfall and lack of water.In addition, more homes are being built to meet the increasing demand for city living culture.People such as students and teenagers are biased towards urban culture for quality education and employment.For example, technology companies are hiring more freshers due to which literates are travelling to towns. Ċ However, lack of control over building new homes is causing serious problems such as air pollution and construction accidents. Although real estate supports the economic growth of any country, it is causing environmental problems. Many builders are cutting green trees while building houses, which is the major cause of increasing pollution. To illustrate, trees are removed in cities whenever there is no room for building new infrastructure.Moreover, buildings are getting collapsed since many builders are using poor quality raw materials for construction.To give a clear example, countries like are reporting more deaths due to the building collisions. Ċ To conclude, illegal constructions numbers are climbing in cities and towns nowadays.In my opinion, the disadvantages outweighs the advantages because of this situation."
10952,"Some people say that school children should be given individual class work, while others think that working in small groups is better for them. Discuss both approaches and include your own opinion.","Undoubtedly, the education sector has observed a considerable uplift in its approach over recent years. This has enabled some people to believe that children should be assigned individual classwork while others entrust that working in micro-groups will be beneficial for them. I, however, strongly opine that a blended methodology will be in fact far more beneficial in lieu of either one of them. In this essay, we will discuss these various approaches along with some references supporting the argument. Ċ Firstly, the individual tasks are believed to enhance certain basic characteristics like concentration, memory-building, problem-solving and many more. For instance, a child working on a project single-mindedly will face a lesser amount of distraction in spite of group-based work, where students often get deflected. Therefore, parents are inclined towards the notion of separate assignments. Secondly, the aforementioned step will indeed assist in analysing an individual’s level of intellect thereby it will enable teachers to offer customized learning approach and better counselling and support. Also, I opine that this measure will yield more specific results as every student is different yet special in his or her attitude, hence the comparison needs to be done on an individual basis rather as a whole. Ċ On the other hand, group tasks empower children to build their own social network as these projects are intended to foster team-work and coordination. This, in my view, is an advantageous measure to promote co-dependency, which will prove favourable in future. For example, children jointly working in a crew will be more extrovert and socializing than the ones who operate solely. Furthermore, a pupil can identify the team’s strength as well as weakness besides can have multiple measures to resolve a single problem hence attaining a wider perception and becoming more adaptable. Ċ In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that although both the above-mentioned approaches work in their respective manner, still it is important for the academic curriculum to have a balance of both the measures. As either one of the aforementioned steps will not give adequate outcome rather will have partial-visibility."
10953,"IELTS: Nowadays, many secondary schools teach business and communication skills that help students get a job instead of traditional subjects such as history. Do you agree or disagree with this change?","With the increasing unemployment rate, many parents prefer schools to provide lessons that are helpful for students to prepare for a future job, such as business or communication classes. As a result, the number of classes such as history and ethics are decreasing. It seems that this change needs to be considered due to the fact that traditional subjects also have their benefits as much as business classes do. Ċ It is true that more benefits exist when subjects related to students' potential occupations are introduced at the early stage. It provides a broader background that helps decide their future careers. It then allows them to make a better choice of a subject at a tertiary education. Furthermore, if an individual found an interest in such a class, they are more likely to study and develop the relevant skills earlier than others. It gives more opportunity to success in the filed they choose. Thus, such classes are preferably recommended. Ċ The importance of traditional classes, however, should not be neglected because they are also helpful for individuals' career. One benefit could be that it allows students to foster a better personality by learning moral values in ethics classes and experiencing ancestors' lessons in history classes. Also, a broader knowledge of such subjects will let students to solve problems in a variety of perspectives. These benefits are definitely a positive factor not only for their career but also for personal interaction skills and therefore such classes are as equally important as business classes are. Ċ In conclusion, even though there is a high demand for schools to have business or communication skill subjects, schools should not decrease the number of classes of traditional subjects. That is because students will also have benefits from learning history or ethics when it comes to the employment."
10954,success is often measured by wealth and material belongings. Do you think wealth is the best measure of success? what makes a successful person.,"In today's materialistic world, it is commonly believed that prosperity and material possessions are the criteria of achievement. This essay will consider whether being prosperous are the indicator of attainment, or whether there are other factors which contribute to a person being achieved. Ċ While most people consider that wealthy people are successful, I strongly disagree with that viewpoint. This is because richness cannot bring a real sense of happiness while some might argue that money can satisfy their needs such as buying luxury items, travelling pricey trips or dining in a fine restaurant. However, these things are just contemporary enjoyment. A major reason is because people tend to leverage their quality of living according to their income. For that reason they are more likely to get depressed, stress about earning more money all the time which lead them unhappy life. Ċ Therefore, it is obvious that richness is not the only factor that contribute towards a happy and successful life. On the other hand, it is comprised of many elements to enable people attain their objective growth. Firstly, having healthy relationships can be a dominant incentive as nobody succeeds without the help of others. For example, many scientists, entrepreneurs can meet their goal because they have had teams behind them, support from family, friends or have read and researched the view of others. Furthermore, they must be in a good health and have passionate in what they are doing which I reckon that these factors enable to steer them towards accomplished journey. Ċ In conclusion, richness is unable the best measure of attainment since it cannot bring the real sense of fulfilment in a person's soul. In my opinion, people should place an importance on cultivating strong relationships, healthy habits and figure out our stimulating job. By doing this, we would find the true sense of satisfaction in life."
10955,Most societies has its homeless people. Some people think that the best way to help them is to give them money. Ċ To what extent do you agree ?,"In the 21st century, people have seen numerous ups and downs. These oscillations of life have left many people homeless either because of loss in business or cause of debt. To help the homeless people, it is argued that giving them money will help them. I strongly stand against this notion. In this essay, why providing homeless people money, do nothing to encourage them to change their life and instead of helping them to earn on their on own do good will be discussed. Ċ To begin with, people without homes should be helped to get work and handing over the money should be avoided. Additionally, persons who lost their houses are generally in mild depression due to their situation. whilst offering them cash is a good deed, leaving no other motivating factor to improve their status quo. For instance, one who gets the capital out of empathy will not work for it and continuously seek others to give him fund thus, his situation remains unchanged. Therefore, helping the homeless by giving them money does not help to encourage them to transform their life. Ċ Furthermore, the money giving away to houseless one’s will be spent on socially unacceptable activities like gambling and consumption of alcohol due to their mental instability. Moreover, getting homeless is depressing in itself and if they get cash without any hard work will go in either gambling or drinking. Alternatively, they must be helped to earn their own bread and butter channelizing their mental stress positively. For example, homeless people who were rehabilitated into society by organisations lead a more productive life as compared to those who do not. Hence, people without a roof over their head should be helped to make an earning rather than giving away money. Ċ In summary, in my opinion, giving cash to homeless will do no better to them mentally and even they will dwell into the scenario due to alcoholism. However, they must be helped by other means to get back to normal lives."
10956,"In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?","Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects. Ċ Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful. Ċ Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job. Ċ Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth. Ċ In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly."
10957,Many people are doing their shopping on the internet nowadays. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages if shopping online and give your opinion.,"It is undeniable that in today's techno-savvy era the use of technology is increasingly likely among the people. Therefore, these days the trend of purchasing things on the internet is immense. However, the trend brings both positive and negative aspects and I personally believe that the advantages of online shopping far outweigh its disadvantages. Ċ To begin with, there are numerous reasons why people prefer to buy things online portals. Firstly, there are the wide variety of products available on shopping websites from where people can choose goods which suits their budget and requirements. The convenience is an another point to be considered on the favour of an ordering stuffs by using technological devices. Because one can buy or order anything at any time without commuting to the shopping malls and ultimately it provides reliability to the buyers as they can certainly save their time immensely. Indeed, according to the report of Hindustan Times the 80% of people considered the Amazon an effective and efficient source of an online purchase. Thus, diversity in the collection of an item and comfortability makes this series of browsing internet for buying is an absolute imperative. Ċ Conversely, there are some drawbacks associated with the same which could not be ignored. For one point, shipping problems or delays in the delivery are worse situations that people often face when they choose certain websites or portals for the purchase. Also, sometimes people receive the parcels too late or an inappropriate things which are totally opposite to what they have ordered. In addition, return can be complicated in some cases because it is seen that buyers could get a wrong article and if they return it, then it is a big trouble. For example, there have been some recorded instances of people's bad experiences that hinder them to avoid the shopping websites. Overall, it is not as much convenient in terms of delivery arrangements and returning. Ċ In conclusion, an advent of technology allows the people to prefer shopping online rather than visiting the stores. Although online shopping has an incredible benefit to the people in this fast-paced environment, but its side effects should be overlooked. As far as I concerned, this trend should be positively accepted as it is far more advantageous than its negative consequences."
10958,"In many countries, teenagers are encouraged to do part-time jobs. What's the situation like in your country? What do yout think are the advantages and disvanatges of doing part-time jobs?","The adolescent phase is the transition phase from a child to a young adult.In some parts of the world,teenagers are given permission to do part-time employment ,whereas some countries do not motivate them.This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages including why I believe that young adults should have a head start from the adolescent phase,using examples from recent studies to demonstrate points. Ċ On one hand,teenagers learn a lot during their part-time employment.They develop a sense of responsibility and become independent.Additionally,they learn financial management of their salary,which is an important life skill. For example,a recent study by the University of Columbia showed that many tech billionaires,who worked as employees during their graduation, had better business financial management skills compared to those who never attempted to work.Moreover,they have turned out to be risk-takers,achieving success in life.Therefore,employment from a young age instils a sense of responsibility. Ċ On the other hand,exposing children to monetary benefits may result in them deviating from the path of further education.Once teenagers start earning,they lose focus of their aims and goals in life.This will often cause them to get stuck in mediocre jobs throughout their lives.Furthermore, the salary earned by them could be misused for illegal purposes.In fact,it was noticed by many parents that their children started drinking alcohol and using drugs with their salary,often ending up in rehabilitation centres.These are the reasons why young adults should not be encouraged to work. Ċ To conclude,working from a young age has advantages as well as disadvantages.In my opinion,children should be allowed to work to make them more responsible and independent."
10959,"Some deem that job pleasure is more important than job society. In contrast ,others think thay having a stable job is better than enjoying the job. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many claimes that relishing the jobs are more significant than job society. However,some people opine that remaining in a stable occupation is more effective than enjoying the works. From my point of,view, I believe that job pleasure is the most crucial thing for a person. Ċ Firstly ,in my opinion ,one of the conspicuous reasons that enjoyment is more important is advancing. For example, the people who set up their favourite business regularly are more successful in their jobs. It means that they usually could reach a staggering progressive in their paths in professions. This would create a noticeable advance in human lives besides jobs. This would definitely for delightful occupation. Therefore ,this makes it clear ,people who relish their works do not deviate from their original goals in addition they proceed to follow the significant items that are required to have without ceasing. Ċ By contrast,some believe that having a constant profession is more essential because this would be a need for a country. For instance ,there are multiple jobs that a country is required to have ,such as doctors , psychologists and nurses. It means that these persons claim that all people who want to choose an occupation should regard the society needs besides ignoring their favourable works . This would create a space where all needs of occupations in countries are provided without employing foreign workforces. As a result ,it becomes apparent ,for numerous humans around the world, the needs of the community are more necessary than personal choices. Ċ To summarise ,I personally believe that ,work enjoyment is more crucial than the requirements of the community. It is predicted that to continue personal pleasure for having a profession all the population around the world will accomplish to their cherish profession also will proceed to progressive."
10960,"Reading books keeps a person’s mind active, whereas watching films and television is passive and does not require a person to use their imagination. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In the age of the film industry, many people prefer watching films to reading books because of the wonderful casts or the outstanding effects of CGI. However, it is undeniable that reading plays a crucial role in developing our imagination. I completely agree with this viewpoint due to some extents below. Ċ There are numerous positive reasons to prove that reading is a better way to keep our minds active than watching movies. While reading, it is vital to picture the scenario, the location, and the appearance of the characters from a few given words, which means that, imagination can be stimulated effortlessly through reading books. Moreover, the meanings of the stories broaden readers' literary horizons and develop useful literary appreciation skills in later life. For example, reading a story based on a real-life event that happened in Munich grants the readers information related to that event or the culture of Germany. Ċ By contrast, watching films and television is considered to be a dependant method of using one's brain. In particular, movies and shows had already had the situations, locations and characters, which limits audiences' imagination. Therefore, watching films requires nothing but concentration, without using the brain. Nevertheless, watching not only narrows the ability to picture but also results in several health problems such as diabetes or heart disease due to spending too much time in front of the screens. Ċ In conclusion, it is true that films, Tv shows are attractive in some ways but obviously, reading benefits our minds better. Thus, in their leisure time, people, especially youngsters, should spend more time reading books than wasting hours watching tv."
10961,"comments on the products and services to the cyberspace and its effect In the world of internet, people write about a product and its reviews as well as their opinion about the service. Is it a good thing or bad thing?","In the internet world, people trend to post their reviews and opinion on any products and services to the cyberspace. In my view it is beneficial to both the buyer and seller. Ċ The prime reason for people to leave their comments to the net would be that for information sharing. And thus the sharing is crucial for other when they need to acquire goods or services they do not familiar with. By access to the reviews and opinions on the net, they will have sufficient information for them to make their purchasing decision. Hence I believe this is vitally important for the people to upload their comments about the products and services to the internet as of it weight on influencing the buying decision of any potential consumer. Ċ In fact this internet comment habit not only good for individual but also positively impacting the seller. Company who provide good services and products is rewarded by the most powerful advertising instrument in the world, that is the internet. Besides company nowadays, instead of waiting for the customer to sending feedback, is proactively seek for people with influencing power and providing them the free sample or trial service and encouraging them to sending reviews and opinions to the internet. These kind of advertisement had been proved by several researches that help generate more business than that of the traditional way, advertising thought the broadcasting media, for instance. Ċ In conclusion, it is the positive development for people who post comments on the products and services to the cyberspace as I believe that it is beneficial to both the individual and company as a whole."
10962,Many people believe that individuals over 65 should not be allowed to continue working. Other think people should be allowed to work for as long as they choose. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"A significant number of people think that persons who are more than 65 years old should be panned from resuming work. In comparison, others believe that individuals should have the choice to continue working for the time period they want. This problem had much public debate recently among people in the community. From my point of view, citizens should continue their work as long as they want. This essay will discuss whether it is useful to let people decide their retirement age, or if there should be some limitations for employees' age. Ċ On the one hand, some countries are running up against high unemployment numbers among citizens, especially among the young generation. Therefore, banning older workers at a particular age could be the solution to this problem. For example, seniors are much more numerous than young people in Japan. Thus, the youngest citizens are obliged to travel to other countries in order to find jobs. While it is true that older individuals should have their jobs too, in order to live their life properly, it is fundamental to provide opportunities for those who are still hoping for one. Ċ On the other hand, the oldest generation has a great deal of experience and a high level of advanced skills. Consequently, they master their work and can be better than young people in different disciplines. For instance, in a significant number of employing applications, it is an obligation to have a higher level of education, a long period of experience, and advanced working skills. These always exist in older workers' CVs. Moreover, some companies find that investing in an older employee is worth more than training a new workforce. In contrast, there are other thoughts that young employers will be more creative and productive. Still, a lengthy experience is essential and fundamental. Ċ In conclusion, the benefit of age limitations has been discussed in this essay. The importance of investing in the knowledge of the oldest members of the workforce also has been mentioned. In my opinion, letting seniors decide when they want to retire is an obligation towards them and the community."
10963,"should ethnical identity of a country be preserved? Question: Some people believe that citizens should keep their cultural identity of their country, whereas others say that it is better for people to integrate themselves into new cultures. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Answer:","It is believed that citizens should preserve their ethnical identity of their country. Nonetheless, others people think that integrating themselves into new cultures would be a better choice. From my point of view, fitting into new cultures will bring much advantages. Ċ On the one hand, the national identity of a country is the one and only, so that people need to know how to maintain and develop their cultural specificity of their country. A country without its identity will be assimilated by others countries. In addition to this, a cultural uniqueness is a big ""pull"" factor for travelers to visit a country. For this reason, citizens should conserve their culture to foster the tourism. Once the tourism is developed, the economics of that country will be raised either. Ċ On the other hand, integrating into new cultures will enrich and affirm one's own distinctiveness. This action will bring a wide range of benefits to the cultural identity, as people learn others countries' specificity and bring back to their country. For instance, the custom of celebrating Lunar New Year is derived from China, this comes to Vietnam and becomes the most significant and important festival of Vietnam. The subsequent explanation is when being exposed to not the same cultures, people will embrace and appreciate others that are different from them. The cultural misconception and racism will be effaced, then the world will be a better place. Ċ In conclusion, I prefer to integrate into new cultures rather than keep my cultural identity of my country. The reason is fitting into new cultures will bring you a perspective look of the world, which is crucial in the 21th century."
10964,Sales companies should recruit people who are hungry for money as they will make the most dedicated workers. Ċ Do you think money is the driving force behind hard work? What factors should be taken into consideration when recruiting staff for sales positions?,"Recruitment of sales positions is quite different from other job positions. There are multiple view on the skills needed for this role. Many believe that the person should be money minded to perform well. I, however, do not completely agree with this view. According to me, there are multiple other factors as well, which determine the success of an employee in a sales role. Ċ The trigger point for a worker to work hard could vary from individual to individual. The main reason for some to believe that money minded people can be good for sales is the nature of the job. For instance, most of the companies provide variable pay to its employees. The more contracts are closed by the staff members, the more benefits they get. This can be a trigger point for many to work hard and perform well. Ċ Additionally, the factors such as interpersonal skills are important as well. As a part of the job, one needs to converse with multiple people and tell them about the product in a very interesting way. There is need of being persuasive as well, so that they can convince the prospective customers to buy the product. Other than monetary reasons, healthy and fun work environment is another major factor sales employee could be looking for. If recruiters target any person who is passionate about the task, then it can also prove good for the employer as it means the staff will feel motivated without greed and will perform well. Ċ To conclude, multiple people may have multiple trigger points to encourage them to perform better. Typecasting everyone in the sales sector to be a money mind is wrong. The recruiters should look for other details about them such as passion, interpersonal skills etc."
10965,People nowad Ċ ays are not fit and active than people from the olden days. Discuss the causes for this situation and suggest some possible solutions.,"Humans today's modern world are not physically active and healthy as compared to past day's folks. The essay will first discuss the biggest cause of the aforementioned phenomenon is the availability of technological appliances and suggest the most effective solution exercise to keep them healthy and well with appropriate examples reaches to a logical conclusion. Ċ To begin with, the foremost cause of the given situation is the excess of appliances due to the high rate of the invention in the technical field then olden days. Additionally, people have all these kind of facilities in their homes to make their homework easy that effects on their daily activities and could throw them toward the laziness. Moreover, not being so active throughout the day could cause a person serious problems such as obesity, high blood pressure. For example, appliances like as, washing machines, dishwashers and robotic vacuum cleaners have reduced a lot of activities of a person at home however, these kind of facilities were not present in past days human used to do their house chores by themselves. Ċ Furthermore, a possible solution to the present problem would be to stay more active while working and staying at home as well. Even though people have more machines to help them at house chores, but still, they need to do some exercise to keep them physically fit. Nevertheless, an individual can stay physically fit although can makes their necessary distance from illness. For example, washing clothes by themselves is a sort of exercise that involves a lot of shoulders and arm movements. Ċ In conclusion, despite today's facilities made daily life easy, but reduce the quality of health too for people as comparison olden days, if there are a plethora of issues involved for unfit lifestyle ,therefore, there are many possible solutions to improve own wellbeing."
10966,"pros and cons of sponsoring education. Task 2: Children's education is expensive. In some countries, the government pay some of or all of the costs. Do the advantages outweigh its disadvantages?","Nowadays. the tuition fees on children are expensive. In some nations. the government subsidise some of or all of the costs to help children have an access to learning. From my perspective, although this trend is not without disadvantages, the upsides will justify these. Ċ There are a number of drawbacks of this trend that will be mentioned . First, since government is willing to fun for education costs, it is likely to put more burden on national budgets. For example, other key fields, either economy or healthcare, is also needed much investment. When governments cover many aspects of education, they in turn force to impose more taxes on individuals, leading to put burden financial on low-income families. Second, it is likely to be unfair to childless people. This means, they incline to be unpleasant because they money is used not for their benefits. Ċ On the one hand, many benefits should be taken into account. First, funding for kids' education is of great benefit to families as well as society. In fact, in some case, parents are not able to afford the cost of education for their kids as their saving are meager. Therefore, this policies can open the opportunities of education for aspiring students, leading to enforce the quality of workforce in the long run. Second, by paying the tuition fees, parents can be released from the burden education fees, helping them have more budget to take goodcare of their kids in terms of food, clothes or medical care. Ċ In conclusion, with all convincing arguments mentioned above, it seems to me that the demerits will be overshadowed by merits."
10967,Sending criminals to prison is not the best method of dealing with them. Education and job training are better ways to help them. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Imprisonment is not a sensible way to treat offenders. Instead, the responsible way is to educate them and then train them for some kind of jobs. This essay completely disagrees with this and I intend to justify it in the following paragraphs. Ċ First and foremost, the purpose of imprisonment is not just to isolate the criminals. The offenders should also realise their mistakes before being released. So, they do not become a lawbreaker again, if encountered with a similar situation. For instance, studies show that 80% of the lawbreakers who completed their punishment did not indulge in any criminal activity after being released, because they knew the consequences of breaking a law. Ċ In addition to that, confinement of an offender also takes care of the fact that while being in prison he/she can not do any harm to the society. Furthermore, punishing an accused also serves the purpose of justice given to a victim. For example, one of my friend's father was murdered by some miscreants. He had to fight that case for 10 years to prove them of guilty. For him, the justice was delivered on the day when all of them were sentenced for 20 years of confinement. Ċ To conclude, imprisonment not only serves the purpose of a punishment for an offender it is also a way to deliver justice to a victim and his family. Moreover, it also gives an opportunity to the criminals to realise their mistakes while being in isolation. And at the same time, it also sets an example for others."
10968,Global environment issues are the responsibilities of rich nations not of the poor nation. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"In recent years, all countries in the world have been concerned to tackle the climate change problems. Some opine that the emergency of the global ecosystem should be solved by developed nations, rather than developing one. I personally agree with this notion as the industrial regions are playing a significant role in the current natural issues for the following reasons. Ċ First and foremost, history observers are considered that the western countries contribute to the production of a myriad of carbon emissions on earth that causes natural imbalance. For instance, in the early industrialisation period, there was a multitude of factory activities in several regions in Europe. This phenomenon led to the high amount of carbon dioxides and methane released into the atmosphere and resulted in the greenhouse. As a consequence, it is an absolutely huge responsibility of the wealthy state to come up with a strategic solution to address the catastrophic effects of environmental damage. Ċ Another point to consider is that the high-level economy territories in the world have the capability, in terms of money or technology, to assist greenhouse impacts. For example, when the last G7 meeting has been held in the UK, the representative of the UN has suggested all G7 members donate their resources such as funds and their high technology equipment to help South-East Asia nations solving deforestation cases, floods, pollutions, and others disaster events caused by ecosystem detriment. Ċ To conclude then, I personally agree that most of the states in western are the one who needs to responsible for the unprecedented events happens globally as a consequence of global warming, as they have a contribution on this event and supported by sufficient resources."
10969,"In many countries, traditional dress and costumes are considered effective ways of maintaining links with the past. How effective can traditional costumes be, in this sense? What other ways exist to help citizens connect with a country's past?","Numerous states around the world would agree in case keep on traditional dress and costumes as a way to connect these time with the past. It might be true since traditional outfit and costume being utility to remind the history. Besides, keeping of traditional music exist also relate this generation with before. Both of these issues will be depicted in the following paragraphs. Ċ The first, the traditional outfit and costumes are eminent for society in case of preserve the culture which each of them has diversity of history. Most inhabitans ought to keen their history of their outfits, such as utilizing them for ritual or traditional events. Indeed, several parts of traditional outfit and costumes have certain value that depend on their belief it has to carry on. For instance, the costume of traditional ceremony in Bali, the participant has an obligation to dress white color up as an holy symbol. Ċ Furthermore, it is remarkably understanding the other way to keep the country's past handed down between generation, that is traditional music. Like in varieties population, tarditional music illustrates the story of life of ancient group of people, such as how they socialize in. Moreover, the traditional music has capability reminding the people about the assimilation of two or more cultures. For example, the traditonal music from Central Java, named Gendhing, which mixturing between the Hindu's traditional music intonation and Islam's messages. Ċ To sum up, recognizing the original culture through either traditional dress and costumes or music traditional music are substantial to connect this era with the past since the culture symbolize the charactheristic of the society."
10970,Young people today are better qualified than they were in the past. Some people argue that this is because competition for jobs is greater that it used to be. Others say that people only continue their education because the opportunities exist for them to do so. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Nowadays, the younger generation tends to continue their education to higher levels. This grant them higher qualifications and opens more doors for them in the job market. While some argue that such trend is caused by the need sensed by them to become more and more desirable for a position, others believe people take part in such programs only because they privilege exists. I think the former argument has more weight. Ċ Looking at the unemployment rates, it is obvious that landing a rewarding career is in no way a simple task. Therefore, only had an individual obtained higher degree or professional certificate, they can qualify for their dream job. For instance, many recruiters are looking for tertiary graduates whom are specially trained. The level of skills developed under special training will determine the security of a beginner's career. In fact, the fear of inadequacy drives the potential employees to focus on gathering abilities which help them thrive in the future. Ċ But there's another side to this situation. In recent decades, a lot of educational facilities have been formed, which create the chance to steepen one's knowledge or set of skills. For example the existence of virtual universities enables versatility in the time and place in which the learner attends the class. As a result, these academies providing the learners with a more flexible environment, enable them to pursue their curiosity, whether it affects their occupation or not. Moreover, many who are currently employed would utilize this shot to advance. Ċ In conclusion, societies are faced with a wave of extremely competent youth. This is most definitely a reaction to a vastly competitive market, forcing the candidates to put more effort to better themselves. Although some believe that most of them are just taking advantage of an available opportunity."
10971,Some people think that people who are over 60 years old should not work and should be made to retire. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"A major number of society thinks that it is not a good idea to make older people to work who are above 60. Instead, they should be retired. Although retirement is indispensable, I do not think they should be retired above the age of 60. This essay will discuss this issue using examples to support arguments and demonstrate it. Ċ On the one hand, there is plethora of individuals who are working over the age of 60 and also 65 and they do not care about their age because they think they are strong enough to earn. For example, in corporate companies there are people who work as an agent. Even though they are over 60 they still work to earn and live a happy life no matter what their age is. Therefore, companies should let them work until they are capable. Because they are fit and healthy. Ċ On the other hand, there are few people who are physically not fit for a job as a result of health problems. These people can be retired. For instance, There is a law, In few countries that people who are not mentally or physically fit for a particular profession should not be forced to work at all. Moreover, in such companies these people are made to retire and a pension amount is sent to their homes. Thus, before taking a decision of retirement one should know the concern about others. Ċ In conclusion, companies should encourage individuals who are willing to work even if their age is above 60. Furthermore, they should be made retired only if they have any health issues with them. In future, companies must make it clear who to retire."
10972,Some people believe the best way to reduce the number of accidents on the road is to further limit the speed of the vehicle. Others think there are better ways to tackle this issue. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.,"Misfortunes on the boulevard are every day in the country, including minor and severe mishappenings. The mindset of many residents of society is to curb the speed of automobiles moving on the way to control road accidents; others believe that different measures effectively reduce the prevailing mishappenings, which is a seriously debated issue. This essay will discuss both aspects before my closing verdict. Ċ On the one hand, the idea of banning high-speed vehicles is relatively reasonable. The leading cause of casualty on the roads can be attributed to the drivers' negligence in speeding. In other words, many people, especially our younger generation, drive very fast, in the desire to do something courageous, with vehicle collisions on the roads becoming common. For instance, according to a survey conducted in Delhi, the leading cause of most route accidents is the high speed of automobiles. Therefore, it is imperative to pay attention to reducing the Overspeed of automobiles to save humanity from casualties. Ċ On the other hand, it is necessary to follow other measures instead of slowing down the vehicles of some dissidents living in the society also points to the very right thinking. It would be fair to say that speeding alone is not the only cause of tragic roadway calamity. Alternatively stated, some people use drugs like alcohol while driving, which causes us to have vehicle collisions too; as a result, people are very addicted and sometimes they have to lose their lives. Ergo, the government should show strictness on driving under the influence of alcohol. For example, the ministry has launched an instrument to measure drugs used by the public, and the quantity of alcohol present in human is assessable. Accordingly, the regime takes legal action, and fortunately, this initiative has decreased the tendency of everyone to drive while intoxicated. Similarly, the government should look into more traffic regulations and reduce the number of road accidents. Ċ To conclude, in my opinion, controlling the speed of vehicles is an effective measure to some extent. In addition, several laws need to be enacted with the government in mind, which can lead to complete control of road calamity, with paperwork and enforcement at the forefront."
10973,"Many people think that every individual is responsible for their happiness, but some people believe there are other external factors that influence us. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In the modern world, many individuals are willing to be a fortunate person. In this regard, although some people believe that happiness is a state of mind, others feel that external factors can influence on people. Personally, I reckon that if each individual satisfy with his/her well-being and health, they can reach a sense of fulfilment. Ċ To begin with, many individuals believe that reaching blessedness is impossible without satisfaction. In this reason, in many cases, people’s fortunate depends on many external factors, such as absence of economic hardship in the country. That is to say, citizens of wealthy countries can reach happiness, because they can realize their potential. A good illustration of this is Scandinavian countries. According to the World Happiness Report in 2018, the most happiest individuals on the planet live in this region. Ċ On the other hand, blessedness is considered to be the sole responsibility of an individual with many. This is because, every person should have the ability to take control of their emotions. In other words, they should not be stressed and disappointed, when they meet obstacles and challenges. Otherwise, they can earn some diseases, and reaching happiness is an arduous task for sick people. For instance, many people believe that they are lucky, because they have a good health. Ċ In conclusion, although many individuals believe that fortunate is a state of mind, and each person is responsible for one’s blessedness, others feel that external factors can influence on people. Personally, I reckon that the last option has a significant impact on people, and Scandinavian countries can be proofed for it."
10974,"Many people believe that modern technology has made people more sociable, while others think that it has isolated them. Discuss both ideas and give your own opinion.","Although, a lot of folks think that the advent of advanced technology made the public more outgoing, others believe it created more gap on the already struggling human community. Even though the advent of modern technology opened endless access to meet people in distance land, in my opinion I think it reduced the frequency of face to face intreaction. Ċ On one hand, modren softwares has created limitless and cheap access to the international communites through social media such as: facebook. If this applications where unavaliable, many individuals might not have crossed paths and this bring us closer to world peace since all part of the world is becoming integrated. facebook for instance, enabled affordable communication between loved ones in far away places. Moreover the fact that these softwares can translate foreign languages makes easier to relate with foreigners. Ċ On the other hand, we have seen decline in the level of physical intreaction due to the enormous amount of time spent in front of the screen and this creates an isolation between an individual and his environment. Furthermore, most people spent the whole playing video games instead of attending social functions such as: weddings or a carnival at the local park which could have availed them the opportunity to make their neighbors. For example, according the recent study in the UK, the world is currently faced with a drastic decline on the turn up at an outdoor event when compared to the trend in the last century. Ċ To conclude, Even though technologies opened up communication channel to the distance land, it however, made people an island. This is not a good survival adaptation because human as a race relay on community effort to survive difficult times such as during Hurricane, so how will neighbours help either other? if they do not even know themselves. This is an error that needs to be corrected."
10975,"Some people say that modern buildings are ugly and are ruining our towns and cities, especially when these buildings are very different from those around them. Others say that they add variety and interest.  Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Nowadays high class buildings as a landmark for each city. As such, several people argue that having an impressive building around the city is becoming attracted and amazed, this is because the magnificent buildings in cities can anticipate economical problems. However, others believe that having it makes cities unhealthy, and this can cause flood and air pollution. Therefore, I would argue that have imposing buildings can make cities look more different than usual and also give income for the government. Ċ On the one hand, people argue that magnificent buildings make cities unhealthy because many green areas have altered by tall buildings. This action can cause flood and air pollution around the areas. Taking Jakarta as an example, many tall buildings have constructed, and this trend causes reducing absorption and green areas that could lead to flooding and air pollution. As a result, flooding in Jakarta always occurs seasonally in every year and automatically the air will contaminated. Ċ On the other hand, certainly impressive buildings have a meaning for each city, especially in develop areas. First, it is making easy for. Also, it makes cities more beautiful and wonderful. Besides that, imposing buildings can help economical per capita in every city because can attract people to travel in the place. Ċ In conclusion, it seems to me that there are many positive effects for cities and towns have impressive buildings. Thus, it is imperative that the government should support this trend and also must control magnificent buildings."
10976,"Topic: There are parents who decide to stay home and look after their families, mostly mothers. Some argue that the government should pay stay-at-home parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In order to improve the living standard of their families, both parents go to work everyday. However, there are some parents who make a decision to stay at home and take care of their families. Most of them are mothers. Some people believe that the government should pay those stay-at-home parents. In my opinion, I agree with this idea. Ċ Parents who stay at home have many household chores to do. Some people say that doing housework is harder than working in the office because housework is a boring and difficult job. Thus, all stay-at home parents should be paid as those who work in the office. Ċ Moreover, a family that has a stay-at-home parent generally has more happiness than a family that has both parents working. In fact, stay-at-home parents do not only provide warmth to their families, but also contribute to the society as well. To illustrate, children that have stay-at-home parents usually perform well in class and study hard as parents are great help in improving their children's education. In addition, when a child has a parent who stays at home, he or she generally has good manners and is advised to know what is right and what is wrong. Therefore, there is a decrease in the rate of juvenile delinquency, which occur because both parents are occupied in their work and the lack of interaction between children and parents. Furthermore, children are healthier if their parents stay at home with them. They can have nutritional food everyday and get treatment immediately if they have a particular illness. Ċ All things consider, I hold the view that the government ought to pay stay-at-home parents because those parents bring abundant advantages to both their families and society."
10977,Some people think it is more important to spend money on roads and motorways than on public transport systems. To what extend do you agree?,"Investing in roads and motorways instead of public transport systems is a common idea for numerous citizens. I completely disagree with this opinion due to the advantages of spending budget on public transportation and the reasons are outlined below. Ċ Firstly, public transport helps reduce pollution. Subways and buses are the typical representatives of this transporting form. By switching from personal vehicles to underground or buses, the number of automobiles operating on roads at a time reduces significantly. This leads to a decrease in the amount of emission into the atmosphere and then improve air quality. For instance, numerous large European cities such as Paris or London have extremely complete public transport systems, which help them to limit the total of personal vehicles on the traffic network, helping the authorities to control the pollution level. Ċ Another reason to support the development of public transportation is originated from the financial benefits. Motivating citizens to switch from individual automobiles to shared ones can help reduce society's fuel costs. For example, a bus can replace a sum of vans in a defined route due to its large capacity for passengers. Therefore, rather than consuming a large amount of gasoline for several cars of passengers who are on the same way to their workplaces, the fuels are using economically by the bus system. Spending less money on gas means that the government possesses a better financial capacity to make other essential investments, which improve social living standards. Ċ In conclusion, while a number of people are interested in developing roads and motorways, I strongly believe that governments should spend budget on public transports, which can bring various benefits in both environmental and financial aspects."
10978,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.,"Everyone have happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion , childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Ċ First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills , jobs , how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighbourhood . Moreover , I did not have to worry about costs and other things , I just had fun and learned.Also, people are most creative when they were children , children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy. Ċ Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the most memories in a person's life. There , you learn, find your first love, make new long-lasting friendships and of-course have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories. Ċ In other words , childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly."
10979,"Today more people are overweight than ever before. Ċ What is your opinion, are the primary causes of this? Ċ What are the main effects of this epidemic?","Nowadays, one of the main problems people face is increased body weight, resulting in many associated risks. In my opinion, such an issue is primarily caused due to adoption of unhealthy eating habits. This essay will firstly examine various reasons that cause overweight, and secondly, its adverse effects will be discussed. Ċ To begin with, many youngsters are more inclined to unhealthy eating habits, and the possible reason is the advertisements shown in a compelling manner, urging the consumers to try them. Moreover, many youths follow their favourite celebrities blindly in the food product advertisement they appear in. For instance, a top model in India recently appeared in one of the aerated drink brands, and there was a considerable increase in its purchase which was not the case prior to this publicity. In addition to the above, many buy food packages looking at only the fancy key ingredients mentioned in the package; chances are these products may not be effective enough for health. Ċ On the other hand, if people today continue to consume junk meals, its consequence will be observed in the generations to come. To elaborate, consuming a less nutritional and high carbohydrate diet is responsible for excess body weight, which in turn causes some debilitating health hazards, sometimes leading to even death. For example, many youths consume street eateries loaded with unhealthy fats, leading to diarrhoea and vomiting. Furthermore, long term consumption of such meals can have devastating effects on the body, causing severe issues like cancer in the coming future. Ċ In conclusion, being overweight is one of the severe problems caused by factors like unhealthy eating habits. Its long-term effects can be seen in the form of deteriorating health leading to obesity and heart diseases."
10980,"With the development of technology and science, some people believe that there is no great value of artists such as musicians and painters. Ċ What are the things artists can do but the scientist cannot? Ċ Why should we encourage the art area?","In this era of the digital world, traditional professions as musicians and painters not so popular as it was before. More and more people, even creative and talented, try to apply themselves into more technological areas. Nevertheless, there are certain things related to the artists, that are impossible to create in the technical laboratories by scientists. Certainly, the area of art must be encouraged both by governments and by the people. Ċ On the one hand, almost any product that can be made by the artist today, can be created by the engineers. Applications of the artificial intelligence in software and data science are able to do almost impossible. For example, all sorts of computer programs to analyse, create and produce on the output any kinds of digital products. However, in fact, they are able to reproduce or produce only the mix of already existed artworks which was given as an input. Therefore, any technology or a scientist needs someone who understands and feels the music and colours, someone who can contribute a new idea and feeling of the craft. Ċ On the other hand, despite how the science and world around us has developed, generally we are still human beings. As a human being we are still driven by the feelings first rather than computations and rapid analytics. Thus, when will we feel ourselves happy or what can motivate us? A piece of electronic device or a scientific research? Definitely, the answer is the art. In addition, even those devices which we can call a state of art are made by the artists. So there is no doubt, the world, especially now, is in need for the artists. Ċ In conclusion, the way of development of the artists is not apart from the development of technologies and science. We can say that the value of painters and musicians will never decrease, but in contrast, will develop as develop the tools by which they create their artworks."
10981,Some people think old buildings should be destroyed and replaced with modern buildings. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Regarding whether traditional buildings should replaced by the contemporary buildings brings the negative and positive influence is much concerned to a point where a wide discussion has been aroused. Some people hold that it is necessary that the modern buildings are instead of the old. And to large extent, I am on the opposite side of this claim. Ċ First of all, not all the old houses are necessarily obsolete. In effect, some of them are the symbol of culture and history. The quadrangle dwellings, for example, have been going through the China History and it is such an awesome style that impresses the people around the world. Therefore, the government will not destroy them in order to protect our national art. Ċ In addition to this, a proportion of people are adapted to the old living surroundings and it seems not too easy to change that. If all the traditional buildings drop down, some people will lose their home. For instance, many elder people live in their apartment during their whole life, and they never think about moving out. Apparently, some people only want to live the original place and the new things like the modern buildings do not attract them. Ċ At last, the appearance of the modern buildings has never been equal to the inner value of the traditional buildings. Compared to the old buildings, the modern buildings do have the advantages, such as the function, the quality and the awareness in the environmental protection. Meanwhile, in terms of the macroscopic view, the construction of buildings reflects the flourish in the economy. However, if we live in a city with skyscrapers everywhere and cannot find a tiny culture around, it will be a pity for this city as the people live here are rejecting their civilization and losing the treasure which is the most important thing in the world. Ċ Overall, destroying all the old buildings or replacing them with the modern buildings is not a wise choice."
10982,"These days, people work in more than one job, and often change career several times during their life. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?","Nowadays, people tend to work in many different professions in the course of their lives. There are many benefits of this trend, also there are a number of drawbacks. Ċ On the one hand, changing the career path can be seen as beneficial in various ways. Firstly, working in different jobs often broadens the one's horizon. In other words, the person who chooses to change his or her job would have a chance to acquire new knowledge and meet new colleagues; as a result they will improve their expertise and expand their social circle, all of which are valuable life skills. Secondly, the new career might have a financial advantage over the prior one. People often chance their jobs to find better opportunities; therefore, they change to more financially satisfying jobs. Finally, by experiencing more jobs, the individual might eventually find out where his or her passion is, and which job are much suitable for them. Thus, they will be more creative and successful in their targeted jobs. Ċ On the other hand, not having a steady career could have several negative effects. There will be a suffering period in the beginning of every job transition is made. Because each time the worker will probably need to start from scratch again. In addition, blue-collar workers will probably not get justified promotions or hold important positions if they change their career contentiously. To be a CEO of an organization, for example, the employee needs to spend long time in the same company. Ċ In conclusion, doing more than one job during the life could have both pros and cons in the same measures."
10983,"In some countries, there is not enough recycling of waste materials (e.g. paper, glass, and cans). What are the reasons and solutions?","It is quite notorious that some developed nations are not recycling waste materials such as paper, glass and cans. The reason behind this seems to be the lack of enforcement of legislation for the commerce sector. Should this be the origin of the problem, a simple solution would be to involve a neutral party to make sure these organisations abide by the law. Ċ It has been established some countries do not see recycling as a priority, therefore they do not have a clear plan to make sure their population is sorting out recyclable materials as needed, especially the commerce sector. For instance, businesses may see recycling as an unnecessary waste of money. Consequently, they have no interest in investing time and resources to dispose of their waste appropriately. Ċ To solve this issue, there should be a neutral agency auditing the trash disposal protocol of all the members of the commerce sector. For example, a non-governmental company monitors commercial waste to make sure private companies are following the rules and adhering to the legislation. The neutrality of this report would make it indisputable, hence business owners would have to change their behaviour. Ċ In conclusion, most of the waste not being recycled comes from the commerce sector of some countries. Despite legislation in place, these commerces choose not to recycle because it would impact their profit. Nevertheless, there is a clear solution to this problem, as simple as hiring a private company to inspect these businesses and to make suggestions where necessary. Although it seems like a simple solution, additional considerations should be made where countries do not have a trustworthy law enforcement agency."
10984,Some say that is more important for employers to consider academic qualifications rather than personal experience and values when hiring an employee. Do you agree or disagree? What are positive and negative aspect of the issue?,"It is vivid that educated and specialists persons are more attractive and suitable for employers than others. But, there is an issue that which academic competence or personal life style is more valuable for hiring an employee, as both have pros and cons. These advantages and drawbacks will be investigated before a reasoned conclusion is drawn. Ċ On the one side, some crowds have all been the idea that the capability of employees should be valued by their academic qualifications when anointing them. They suppose that it could be provide a standard comparison between volunteers for the hiring. In addition, personal life understanding cannot measure in a form of short time interview. They believe if an individual has educational evidence, he/she would have its profession, immediately, and despite of that if a human has only a profession maybe she/he does not have its academic supplements. Ċ On another side, there are some populations who mention the experience in the human life is more justice criterion than college certificates. In their opinion, in many cases the property situation plays the main role in gaining academic certification. Some people because of their financial situation cannot continue their education, despite of their capabilities, and it is far from humanity the employers ignore their skills and life experiences. Ċ In addition, some humans have been educated only by force and do not have any proficiency in their fields of study. Ċ To sum up, following the analysis of both points of view, as far as I am concerned maybe proficiency is more crucial to consider while hiring than academic qualification, because of its reliability."
10985,"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Write about the following topic. Ċ Pollution of rivers, lakes and seas is a major concern for people who seek to protect the environment. Ċ What are the possible causes of water pollution, and what effects does this have on animal life and human society? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 254 words.","It is believed that the environmental protectors are alarmed concerning the overwhelming increased environmental pollution on streams, ponds and the oceans. I believe that environmental contamination brings adverse effects on aquatic wildlife and human social lives. This essay will shed light on the motives and their consequences providing evidence to prove the arguments. Ċ There are manifold causes for water contagion throughout the world. First and foremost, the scarcity of environmental regulations. In other words, the world has stricter laws to punish the factors and individuals who dispose of their waste in these natural environments. Yet the shortfall in controlling them makes these ecosystems vulnerable. Let us take, African nations as an example, the recent research from Unizambeze University pointed out that 70% of factors deposited their disposal materials in the near pond without any pre-treatment . As a result, the local naval ecosystem died, causing any alarming environmental pollution. Ċ Secondly, the sea poisoning vanished the local species. Because of grimed water coastal wildlife is under threat, it irradicated the majority of them such as birds, dolphins, whales, seals. For instance, the scientific investigation carried out by Oxford University last year, showcased that the seas and rivers epidemic vanished roughly 5000 aquatic specimens. Hence, human beings social lives are affected. Moreover, the men overdependence on fish and lamb will affect the human lifestyle in the near future. Ċ In conclusion, the rising in deep-sea ecosystem corruption is caused by human activities, especially the garbage from energy power plants, machinery factories, and other sources. It has undoubtedly adverse side effects on the local ecosystems and men life. Therefore urgent people's action is needed so that the remained species could survive and men life enhanced."
10986,"In many countries, more and more young people are leaving school and unable to find jobs after graduation. What problems do you think youth unemployment will cause to the individual and the society? Give reasons and make some suggestions.","In contemporary society, increasing number of youths is exposed to unemployment, especially to those fresh graduates who burden much expectation by their parents and public. Ċ This thorny issue arouses the concern of the whole society since it affects the future of a society or even a nation. Ċ Originally, most students after graduating from universities or colleges can hunt decent jobs, but this is not the case now. Numerous employing entities, conversely, shut the door to graduates. For this abnormal phenomenon, there are many causes. First, a great many of older staff have not gotten the retirement age; therefore the young students cannot replace their positions. Second, population problem lead to the result that graduates outnumber positions. As a result, many graduates complete one position which mere is a work for an ordinary work. Final, there is not a suitable link between university and workplace. As a matter of fact, when students graduate from universities, most of them have not any practice experience, while it lead to companies cannot employ suitable individuals. Ċ Meanwhile, there also have some solutions to this thorny problem. On one hand, universities should immediately optimize their curriculums in order to supplying the demanding of student and workplace respectively. On the other hand, governments should encourage graduates become self-employed by fund and offering training free of charge. More importantly, companies should afford the opportunities for those youth unemployed, which is also a responsible to the whole society. Ċ In summary, I personally believe that, governments, companies and universities should cooperate together to deal with this severe issue. Likewise, students should improve their own skills, so as to avoid unemployment."
10987,It has been proposed that citizens should only consume food and drink products that have been produced in their own countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The idea of consuming local food and beverage products from host countries because they correspond to local taste preferences. However, this resulting a scarcity of the foreign investors, particularly in food industry. Ċ The Citizen should eat local meal and drink because it is more suitable in taste than import it, thus it is necessary for residents to create their own food. Not only do they miss their family and home, but if they reside overseas, they also tend to make or find their own cuisine. In Singapore, there is community for Indians, and they eat and sell Indian food there like Makhani (butter chicken) and Chole (chickpea curry) because there will always be a meaningful for local cuisine. Ċ On the other hand, attracting international investors in the food business is quite difficult since they are constrained by rules that require them to consume only local food and beverages. What is the significance of this investment? if the number of customers is small, multinational restaurants such as KFC, Burger King, and Starbuck will not grow their company in a country that mostly citizens do not appreciate foreign cuisine. Finally, a reduction in the cost of capital for external investors has the effect to decrease wages and economic income, especially in food industry sector. Ċ In conclusion, I strongly believed that Investment in food sector is required to boost the national economy, so citizens need to consume other food than what they produced. It is suggested that local food is still sold in greater quantities than international food in supermarket, since more and more residents prefer consume large amounts of local food."
10988,"In many countries, people decide to have a child at a later age. Ċ Why is this? Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","Nowadays, it is suggested that a couple should have children at a later age. This essay will elucidate the reasons for this and although there are several drawbacks, they are dwarfed by the benefits. Ċ To start with, people choose to have children later because either they want to have a more stable financial status or to learn more skills of teaching a child. Firstly, thinking of having a child after some years of marriage would give them more time to focus on their career. Accordingly, they would accumulate more money, thereby spending them on better growing environments such as kindergartens or international primary schools. Secondly, these parents could also learn about how to teach a baby before having one. By acquiring certain knowledge in teaching their offsprings, they would be more confident when it comes to lecturing children. For instance, upbringing courses in Vietnam are increasing considerably to educate future parents about those skills before having sons or daughters. Ċ On the other hand, this could entail two disadvantages, namely the over-concentration on work and genetic disorders. Because the age from 35 to 40 is said to be the best time to make money and develop career paths, many parents have focused more on their jobs and hence their less care for their children. In fact, this has resulted in numerous arguments and divorces in many families, especially in Asian countries, where work is prioritized rather than children. Another demerit is that having a baby late would give rise to more chance of genetic disorders, in this case the Down syndrome. Research has shown that women after the age of 35 would be more likely to reproduce an infant with Down syndrome. This syndrome terribly affects on a child's life and all people suffer from it cannot live past sixteen years old. Ċ In conclusion, better financial status and background of upbringing are the reasons for this and because nowadays people are more caring about their offsprings the disadvantages much pale in comparison to the advantages."
10989,Some people consider thinking about and planning for the future to be a waste of time. They argue that people should live in the moment. Do you agree or disagree,"It is considered by some people that further planning and thinking about the future is just a vain attempt and people ought to spend their life fully at the moment. I disagree with this notion and believe that planning and thinking are beneficial in terms of getting success and confronting plights in the forthcoming future. Ċ Firstly, the major positive factor in the favour of future plannings and considerations is that individuals can achieve success in their life. In other words, the level of competition is burgeoning at an alarming rate and to cope up with this, individuals need to make some strategies beforehand. For instance, if a person wants to run a business, he has to design some plans to reach the pinnacle by accomplishing their goals and targets at delivered timings. Therefore, masses can get name and fame through their action plans along with rational thinking. Ċ Secondly, the masses may face immense menaces in their life without pre considering their objectives and targets. To be more precise with, if one is not mentally prepared regarding the future challenges then there would be more chances to receive the worst consequences as well as failures in subsequent years. According to a survey, 70% of people manage to deal with the hurdles of every aspect of their lifespan by merely doing the organisation and arrangements. Ultimately, planned actions could be more fruitful for better survival rather the happiness of a single moment. Ċ In conclusion, I think that preprepared programs are lucrative in attaining the prosperity and quite helpful in facilitating the individuals with the ability to tackle with the hard circumstances of life instead of simply live the present moment for the sake of temporary happiness."
10990,Some people agree that teachers should be strict with their students; others believe that teachers with friendly approach will achieve better results. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Teacher and student's relationship has always been in questions. At one side, there are the people who speak in the favour of a friendly approach of teaching the students whereas on the other side, some people believe that teachers must be strict and should not tolerate any negligence from the students. In rest of the essay, I shall analyse both sides of the arguments and present my opinion based on that. Ċ The commenters who prefer the strict approach of teaching for students often reason with the nature of human. They strongly believe that in order to teach something one has to impose the rules and majority of humans do not follow it until they are being strictly forced to act on it. For example, talking about students if teachers do not set deadline on the classwork or assignments, no student would do it. Moreover, the strict behaviour of a teacher causes the student to complete their work with attention. According to the people, strictness of a teacher is a key towards making the student valuable. Ċ On the other hand, however, the people who prefer teacher's lenience over strictness for students provide the reason of better learning in friendly environment. They believe that humans understand the language of love. The unnecessary strictness may divert a student's mind towards negative things. They argue that students learn more efficiently and quickly when they are not subjected under stress. A teacher's light and good sense of humour may help a student to learn even the most difficult parts of the subject. Furthermore, students feel more comfortable to the teachers. As a result, they ask questions without hesitation. Ċ To summarise, I believe that a mixed approach should be followed as both approaches are correct to a certain level."
10991,Children today have more responsibilities than the past. Some people think it has positive effects than negative ones while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"While it is often argued by some people that youngsters are more responsible in the current era, whereas others take the view that many young people are more attentive in the old days. My opinion is that it is better to hold much responsibility nowadays. Ċ On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that children grow with less responsibility. The major reason for believing this is that laziness. This is due to they spend more time with social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Tumbler. Furthermore, it urges them to check their cell phone frequently and this leads to lack of helping others. Another reason is that children's are really careless when they do daily activities For example, a child aged between 8 to 12 years are less attentive in their work. Ċ Despite the above arguments, I hold the position that young people are more responsible. Indeed, one reason why I take this position is that they are focused in the field of education. Since the education system in the modern era is highly competitive and they were facing many difficulties to study. However, it is my opinion that kids show respect to their elders in the family. To illustrate, the New York Times publishes an article about the responsibilities of children at a young age which surge from the year 2019 to 2020.As a result, the bonding between both are very strong and brings more happiness in the family. Ċ In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that youngsters show more responsibility. This is because education is most important and in addition to family bonding. Given this situation, it is recommended that the government around the world should think about implementing this form of encouragement through online media."
10992,"Some people say it is OK to use animals for our benefit, others say it is not good to exploit them. Discuss both points of view and give your opinion. Animals should serve the people","Some individual believe that human should use animal for their personal benefit while other argues that this is a bad practice. This essay will discuss the both aspects of the argument. In my opinion, this is necessary to use animal for the scientific and security purpose other than this they should be allowed to live freely. Ċ One the one hand those who do not support animal exploitation is a good practice might argue that all animals are living being they should also have the liberty to live their life. The reason for this is people exploiting them dreadfully, they killing and eating them. For instance, In recent survey of New York time it is claimed that Beef eating has increased from 10 to 20% compared to last year analysis. Therefore, it is not a good idea to utilize them for human benefits. Ċ On the other hand, people who support utilization of animals might support the idea that it is for the betterment of society, scientist do have to perform the experiments and for this, animals are the best object. For example, all the medicines first tried and tested on animals and then on successful completion of experiment, these medicines get approval for the consumption of humans. As a result of this, animals are necessary for the new invention and improvement in medical facilities. Ċ In conclusion, although animals can be utilized for the scientific experiments and medical test, In my opinion, there is no deny in the fact that animals should to be exploited for the consumption of human beings."
10993,Cohabitation is believed to bring huge advantages for young people since it enables them to fully understand each other before deciding to get married. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"There is no doubt that living together is ,currently, so popular among youngsters. It is considered that by doing this the couple would get a better understanding of their partner. I completely agree with the statement because they can realise how compactable and realistic they are. Ċ Firstly, it is significant to know the compatibility between the potential couple. This is because the decision of getting married has a long impact on both individuals, this is expensive, involving other family members, friends and colleagues. For example, in many European countries,it is common to live together before the actual wedding takes place. Therefore, if anyone in the relationship feels that they cannot continue further, they can move apart without involving any legal case. Ċ Secondly, by staying for a long time under the same roof allows them to earn individual differences. This is crucial in a relationship, especially in marriage, otherwise, this can lead conflict in the latter part of life. There are many other factors, for instance, trust, mutual understanding and couple goals are must be matched perfectly. These all learning process can be taken during the stay, eventually, either they can proceed with the same person or leave away. Ċ In conclusion, Some people think that it is better to cohabit before getting married as this allows them to fully understand . I personally support this belief as which gives a clear picture of another individual, based this they could decide about the future. It is highly recommended to think twice before making choices."
10994,Many of today's most urgent problems can only be solved through international cooperation. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Global collaboration can alleviate timely problems. In this essay, I will be discussing the reasons why I strongly agree that difficulties, which include the pandemic brought by the COVID-19 virus as well as depletion of resources, can be solved if the different countries cooperate with one another. Ċ A major reason is international partnerships can restore the balance in relationships. For example, the world is still continuously facing the struggles of the COVID-19 pandemic, even though there are already numerous vaccines made available. If developed countries donate these vaccines, the world could eventually reach the desired herd immunity at a faster rate. Consequently, bans and restrictions will be lifted and will make way for international travel once again. Ċ In addition, the separation between social statuses can be lessened resulting in the absence of dominance. For instance, there is an abundance of fish and other seafood in the Philippines because of its archipelagic state whereas oil reserves are difficult to obtain. On the other hand, the Middle East is a popular source of oil. If these nations communicate well, they will be able to distribute and eventually outsource their needs. It will be advantageous not only to the government but also to the locals who would benefit from the availability of the resources. Furthermore, there will be an equal distribution of resources. Ċ In conclusion, major dilemmas can be solved through worldwide cooperation. I strongly believe that these can not only make way for proper communication but also make people treat everyone equally."
10995,"Some people believe that the responsibility for the protection of the environment is by a transnational organization, rather than by each individual country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this day and age, environmental preservation is one of the most concerning problems in the world. Although some people argue that the duty of environmental conservation belongs to transnational organizations, while the opposite side believes that each individual nation should take responsibility for this problem. In my opinion, I partly agree with this point of view. Ċ On the one hand, each individual nations are the one who takes responsibility for the duty of protecting the surroundings because it directly affects human well-being. In other words, the environment has been destructed by anthropogenic activities. Global warming is the case in point. Every year, global temperature has increased due to human activities such as industrial and agricultural activities in the past. As a result, conserving the habitat is a serious project which not only benefits humankind in the current generation but also for the future generation. Ċ On the other hand, I also believe that transnational organizations play an important role in calling citizens all around the world lending a hand to save the surroundings from danger. It is undeniable that international organizations have the power to raise countries’ awareness to keep environmental safety. For example, Earth Hour is an event created by the World Wildlife Organization, which encourages residents from all around the world to turn off light to save the habitat. Therefore, the more inhabitants protect the environment, the better the environment is. Ċ To sum up, it is critical to protect the setting, thus not only transnational organizations but also each individual countries need to be environmentally conscious."
10996,"children's life was different in the past. In many parts of the world, children's lives were very different from today. What do you think were the advantages and disadvantages of life for children in the past?","The lives of childs in today's society are changing so much comparing in the past because the world has changed. In the past, there were both advantages and disadvantages of children's living standards. Ċ There were a number of benefits of living in the past for the children. Firstly, they were probably happier than today because they had a simple life and they did not suffer stress from their parents for the scores in School. Secondly, they had more time with friends and families. They could learn life skills from their siblings when they played together. In addition, the kids exposed to the natural environment very soon therefore, they seemed to close to nature. Ċ However, in my view, the children's lives in the past also had several important disadvantages. The living standard of the kids was affected by war and poverty. There were a lot of children who could not go to the school, which were the reason for illiteracy. They even did not have enough food so they had to work to earn money very soon. Child abuse situations were found in many companies in the past. The parents could not take care of each child and gave them the best living condition. Ċ All in all, I believe that the disadvantages of children's lives in the past were greater than the advantages. The children's way of life in the past was happier but they were not always able to get big benefits from it because the world of children today has many differences."
10997,Recent advances in technology have led to significant changes in today's world. Discuss the positive and negative effects of these technological changes.,"Technology has become more and more important to human's life. Therefore, advance in technology has tremendous changes on today's world. This essay will discuss the effects of these changes, focusing on positive and negative impacts. Ċ Technology impacts today's world positively by two main ways. First, it makes life more convenient and easier. With the help of technology, many works for example household chores can be done without human. An article of Buzzel.com states that time are saving thanks to the help of machines which could learn and complete task efficiently. Besides that, advanced technology can finish works which are dangerous for human like mining. Second, technology causes several influences on human's entertainment. Before the appearance of technology, human's form of entertainment was poor, but today's world own an enormous source of entertain. Ċ Technology also has negative effects on world particularly human's health and communication. The first effect is health. Since technology help people doing almost everything and provides wide range of entertainment, they become lazier and not likely to participate in outdoor activities. Therefore, many health problems are caused by the impact of technology. For instances, obesity risk is increasing among children according to Children and Technology: Analysis and Recommendation. The second effect is communication. It is ironic that people do not have many chances for face to face interaction. Moreover, according to Buzzel.com article, people prefer using communication technology than interact personally. Ċ In conclusion, technology has several positive effects on today's world like making life more convenient and providing huge entertainment storage; however it can affects people's health and interaction negatively. Therefore, people should find solution for these problems."
10998,"In countries where there is high unemployment, most pupils should be offered only primary education. There is no point in offering secondary education to those who will have no hope of finding a job. To what extent do you agree or disagree? secondary schools should be motivated","Unemployment is upturns and downturns in some countries, which leads to some opinions that students should be merely allowed to get access to primary schools. The statement continues that it is unnecessary to provide them with secondary education while there will be no future in looking for a job. In my perspective, I absolutely disagree with the statement. Ċ Firstly, knowledge or critical skills are extremely worthwhile in the development of students' capability. A student equipped enough essential basic skills can take part in the growth of a certain aspect and be effortlessly received a position. The fact is that the main responsibility of secondary education is to help students explore and enhance their abilities. For example, subjects are set up to create an overview in each sector such as technology, biology, etc. Thereby, students can have the opportunity of perceiving exactly what their demand or desire is, then orient the proper future job. Ċ Moreover, receiving only primary education could cause a serious barrier among social levels. Those who just finished the basic one would be sometimes embarrassed because of their poor situation or become some negative factors due to a lack of education. So, eventually finding a job is more and more impossible. Definitely, others approached higher education could be nothing less than experiencing a large horizon. They could contribute to the national development via their work and enjoy a better living standard from the welfare system and citizenship. It is obvious that offering secondary education would be more effective than the limitation. Ċ In conclusion, secondary schools should be motivated because of specific advantaged, instead of being prevented from unpredictable unemployment."
10999,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should spend money on improving facilities rather than on hiring famous teachers.,"There are a lot of considerations and factors influence the budget allocation of the universities to meet the students' demand. Some universities allocate their budget on improving facilities, while some universities distribute money to hire some famous teachers, and it's still a very controversial issue. Although advanced facilities is very important for conducting research and experiments, I think recruiting celebrated teachers will help students improve themselves much more better. Ċ First of all, some people say that advanced facilities can provide them a good environment to conduct a research and get accurate data; therefore, improving facilities is very important for academic research. Nevertheless, these people don't notice that professors play a key role in the experiments. When students are practicing doing experiments, the most important of all, they should understand the rationale of the experiments. If they don't understand the rationale and just memorize the steps, they actually learn nothing about the experiment. Besides, professors need to explain and help students analyze the data after finishing the experiments. If the analysis is incorrect, the result of the experiment would be wrong. Ċ Second, some people insist that good facilities can stir students' interest in learning, so schools should spend money on upgrading facilities rather than on hiring teachers. However, they don't realize that students need a good teacher to encourage them to be more active. For example, if a student is not able to understand the lectures, he or she may not go to that class anymore in spite of the sophisticated facilities. Therefore, without a good teacher, any great machine is useless for students if they don't know how to use it. Ċ In conclusion, universities should take every aspect into account when they allocate money on different projects. I think universities should spend budget on hiring renowned teacher rather than improving their facilities because it can promote both the quality of students and the willingness to learn."
11000,These days the fashion in clothing are constantly changing. Is this affecting Individuals and the environment in a positive or a negative way,"Nowadays, every day some new fashion-trends are coming to the market. While it is a good way of exploring the world, sometimes it may even hamper people's mindset or our nature to some extent. Though there are arguments, I radically believe that changing and experimenting new things have more benefits than the drawbacks. This essay will discuss both views and explain why I think so. Ċ To begin with, our world is growing every day with rising opportunities, explorations as well as creativity and that have several positive impacts in our society. Firstly, there is an opportunity to follow or experience a variety of fashions around the earth. Consequently, it helps to grow our knowledge about other cultures. For example, many Indian people are now getting to try western clothes and could compare in order to comfort or fashion. Secondly, many new innovative fashions are being explored, thus, people are getting the chance to try that they have never thought of before. In other words, the jumpsuit was unknown even a few years ago, it came to the market by a designer and people liked it so much that now it is a very fashionable outwear in every corner of the world. Therefore, people should be adaptive to new things and give a chance to unexplored possible ways. Ċ On the other hand, sometimes it does even have few negative impacts in our community. Most importantly, people are now following other cultures more than their own, hence the new generation is getting close to forgetting their own traditions. For instance, these days in India, most of the people are finding other outfits more comfortable or fashionable than their regular ones, as a result, youngsters are very much attracted to western clothing instead of their traditional saree or salwar suits. It may result in some cultural clothing lost one day. However, these impacts are very low compared to the positive ones. Moreover, there may be some changes coming frequently, it also helps us to move forward and keep us updated. Ċ In conclusion, this essay has discussed both pros and cons. Although there are both merits and demerits, I reckon that these changes are always advantageous because we should take a chance to update our community in every aspect and welcome anything new."
11001,Young people spend less of their free time with their family nowadays. What are the reasons for this? Are there more negative or positive sides to it?,"In the modern life, youngsters tend to spend less their spare time with family members. There are three reasons for this trend, and I believe there are more negative effects of this trend. Ċ The primary reason is that the development of the entertainment industry brings young people plenty of attractions and temptations outside home. Places such as night clubs, cinemas, karaoke centers and sport facilities all provide youngsters a wide variety of options of entertainment. To compare with the relatively monotonous moment of staying with family, more youngsters prefer to hang out with friends.The second reason is that the proliferation of the Internet and computers lead young people spend less free time with family even if when they stay at home. It is common to see some youngsters are addicted to some internet games or vedio games. Even though they stay at home to spend their spare time, most of time they sit in front of the computer and enjoy the virtual life in the games. Ċ This trend would bring two evident negative effects. Firstly, the generation gap between young people and their parents might be widened as there is no time for effective communication. This may further lead conflicts and misunderstandings between them. Secondly, youngsters may lower a sense of responsibility to their existing family and even their future family. Because youngsters who have been accustomed to play outside would be careless about family events and not interested in participating in family decisions. Ċ To sum up, both development of entertainment industry and computerization lead young people spending less free time with family. This trend should be paid attention by both young people and their family and its related solutions should be explored in order to curb its negative effects."
11002,"The arts, including art, music and theatre are considered to be important in society.  Do you think the arts still have a place amongst our modern lifestyles?  Should the arts be included in school programs?","There are many concerned individuals who feel that art plays a pivotal role in our life and society. Others, however, think that science, technology and business can be more beneficial as compared to cultural activities. I completely agree with the former statement and in this essay, I will support my view with examples. Ċ One on hand, being an artist, it won't pay you much as compared to working in industries or other streams. As a result, our community is not taking these professions seriously. Even though students are more interested in crafts, parents do not allow their children to have careers in them. In addition to that, an artist will have lesser job options as compared to the crowd working in other fields. Due to that, they being forced to look for another option that can provide them financial security. For instance, according to the recent research in the Internation job society, almost 60% of Spain painters are obliged to search for new opportunities in order fill their financial gap. Ċ On the other hand, art should be considered an important subject in the school curriculum, as it improves creativity and imagination. It helps an individual to express their feelings and using pictures and symbols we can communicate with other people. Without the development of imagination and creative thinking, we will struggle to grow into dynamic, individual thinkers. Moreover, many child psychologists often learn the artwork to gain an insight into what they think and feel. To encourage students to learn crafts, the government should allocate financial means, so that people will start looking into it as a potential career option. For instance, the government of Germany founded the art and craft sphere, consequently, it became more attractive to many individuals and more than 40% of people started taking part in arts. Ċ In conclusion, recently art has lost its popularity due to a little amount of salary of artists, and the state may cope with this lack of interest with the help of financial assistance to them."
11003,Do you agree or disagree with following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. Used specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,"Modern life is too hectic and stressful which cause people easily addict drugs and smoking. I agree with statement that smoking should not be permitted in restaurants and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. The reason I believe this statements are to avoid effects on other people health, restrict wrong doing fashion and aware the people of smoking hazards. Ċ The main reason to support this statement is that affects on others health and pollute environment. Study reveal that smoking is affected to other people's health who surrounding the smoker. Restaurant is a place where all ages people come for having food. Generally people come in restaurant for having food and spending happy time with family. If we allow smoking in restaurant, it will ruin the others health especially children as well as it pollute environment. We should not allow people to smoke in restaurant to avoid effect on others and keep environment clean. Ċ The second reason is restrict the unacceptable fashion. Some people generally youth addict for smoking as a fashion. Some TV channels and in movies, actors do smoking to show a style. Youth follow their style and become addict for smoking. In addition some people smoke for stress release. Cigarettes contain drugs which relax brain. People smoke without thinking for their side effects. Ċ Furthermore, Government should take a part to encourage people to stop the smoking. Government should do some advertisement against smoking and aware of their hazards. Ċ In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted not only in restaurants but also all public areas. Government should make a law against smoking and people should be upheld those laws."
11004,Some students feel that grades help motivate student to learn. Others feel that grades can discourage students from learning.,"I am of the personal opinion that grades help motivate students to learn has far better benefits than learn students without grades, and such an opinion is based on the reasons elaborated on below. Ċ Basically, I believe grades help students in progress, which I suppose can be best illustrated by the student could be right competitive together, it has helped them for higher ability to learn. Another point to consider is, some students have shameful and may be spreading themselves from others. This I suppose can be exemplified by when they were place in the low level from top students then they could not adapt to their friends. Whats more, it has been said that professors could be easily teach them based on their ability, and I cannot but agree with such a statement, a typical instance being all of students do not have same level, so students with top levels was faster learn than low levels students with this information the teachers might be better teach to them. Ċ However, I can also see the merits of use of the grade for students. Frist the of all I think divide students to different group could be best way for correct education to them, as in the case of improve learning, high self-confidence and high efficiency were result this method. In addition, I believe grades might be gives students a sense of accomplishment, for instance they were had more try and more motivate for get upper level or stay in their level. Ċ To sum up many argument, and based on the reasons elaborated, above I would like to reiterate that I believe some students feel that grades help motivate for learning to have for better advantages than education without given grades."
11005,"There are many extinct animals’ species in the world. Some people think we should protect animals from dying out, while others believe we should spend more time on problems of human beings. Ċ Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","A highly controversial issue relates to whether to have animal protection reinforced or not. In this essay, I am going to examine this question from both points of view and then explain why I believe the arguments for animal defence is stronger. Ċ It is commonly believed the benefits of animal protection considerably outweigh its disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is that thousands of animals have been dying around the world, which includes domestic and wild ones, in the last decades. It is also possible to say that animals such as human beings have rights for surviving in good conditions. To illustrate, there are several organizations as Greenpeace, WWF and suchlike, which combat thousands of whale hunters yearly that look for them in order to sale their skin to the black market. Ċ On the other hand, it is thought by some that protecting animals is only a matter of wasting people's money. It is often argued that despite the money come from humans it is not used for their purposes. They have this opinion because by using this money to help animals will not bring about any benefits for humans at all. A second point is that animals are not important for human development but entertainment. A good example here is the Zoo, which is considered a hub for bringing together people owing to get to know different types of animals. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that both arguments have their own merits. On balance, however, I feel that animals should be protected at any cost since they are living beings; as a consequence, they own the same rights as humans so they need an exclusive defence since they can not do it for themselves."
11006,"It is better to eat food which is produced locally by small farmers, rather than food produced by ""factory farming"" and transported long distances.","In the age, when wide variety of foods are available, many people prefer consuming food manufactured locally to mass produced, exported food. In this essay I will give my opinion towards this decision. Ċ First of all, products, especially foods produced by a local farmer from a neighborhood are usually fresh, whereas exported goods are always experience a long-distance route, which probably worsens their quality. Quite often, people suffer from low qualitative foods, as a consequence they get ill. This will provoke awareness and people will make sure that they are eating safe and fresh food. Moreover, if to think more specifically, their decision to consume locally produced food can lead to the economic development of that area. Farmers and manufacturers will be encouraged to produce more goods and will have resources to improve the quality. Ċ On the other hand, I think mass-products go through serious inspections, because many people will use these products, and foods are not an exception. Before exporting and receiving ""factory farming"" foods they test them on safety and check for freshness. Another thing to mention is that foods in enormous amounts are usually cheaper than locally generated ones. As to long distance travel of factory foods, I could say that nowadays, with the implementation of advanced technologies, transporting goods is very unlikely will deteriorate their quality. For example, huge fridges are installed on the trucks and ships, which guarantee the initial appearance of food. Ċ To summarize, I have an impression that buying and eating local foods is good when determining their quality, whereas people with strong consideration about the costs will most probably prefer factory made foods. Besides, products from factory are available all year round."
11007,"Eventually, technology will solve the most important environmental problems the world faces today. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Many think that most of the significant issues of the environment nowadays can be solved by machinery. In my opinion, technology will not help, but rather, it will affect the surroundings negatively. Ċ A good reason why technology will not be helpful in solving important environmental problems is that it induces more air pollution. This is due to the fact that the technological devices that people use now have a more complex manufacturing process; mostly are harmful to the environment. For instance, the process of making cell phones involve burning and heating certain materials, which emits unhealthy gas. This gas goes up to the ozone layer, makes it thinner, and thus creates more damaging effects on the earth's surface. Ċ Another point to consider is that automation today is lowering the number of natural resources of the world, causing imbalances in nature. Most of the gadgets today are made out of metal and iron, collected from the deep core of the planet. Mining, for example, is one of the processes in which these minerals are collected and is causing soil erosion to some mainlands. This then causes catastrophes such as earthquakes and landslides, taking the lives of people and animals living in the area; a devastating effect that countries do not anticipate. Ċ In conclusion, technology would not be able to solve the main environmental issues today as it may bring more negative effects such as poor air conditions and diminishing natural resources. Countries, therefore, should continue searching for available solutions to improve the environment's condition, especially for future generations to come."
11008,Some people say that the best way to discourage smoking is to make smoking illegal in public places. Other people say that this is not enough and other measures are needed. Ċ Discuss both these views and give your opinion.,"Smoking is dangerous for health and it evolves lung cancer and subsequent death. In recent years people are using tobacco as a fashion. Some people say that making illegal in the public is the only solution. While others insist on other ways to deal. In my opinion, the adequate way to prevent is the enforcement of a handsome amount of penalty and banned for teenagers. Ċ On the one hand, some people argue for other ways to handle it. According to survey almost, 40% of the World population is drug addicted. This is the responsibility of the Government. First and foremost, the State should impose some strict rules to the Tobacco companies. Furthermore, banned for adults. Moreover, time to time awareness programs conducted such as Tv shows and seminars about the tobacco companies and their consequence. Ċ On the other hand, some people say that making illegal in the public is the best way. However, the consequences of smoking can be deleterious to anyone. For example, like a bus stop on every road same as a smoking area must be there. As a result, the public will be safe from these addicted people's acts. Besides, if anybody breaks the rule, the best way is a penalty. By doing so everyone will follow the laws. Ċ In summary, there is no doubt that tobacco is a silent killer. I believe that the element which is more considerable to reduce the level of addiction is a penalty. In this way, the chances of reduction are more and increase in fear also."
11009,"Due to the development of the internet, public libraries are no longer necessary. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Internet is becoming more advanced and important to some people, to an extent that they prefer this source of education over the traditional approach such as public libraries. However, I strongly believe that libraries are irreplaceable, as not only do they encourage a positive sense of belonging, they are also a more credible source of knowledge when compare to the Internet. Ċ First of all, libraries offer beyond just simple information, they also bring people together and promote a tighter community connection. In fact, these places are often considered to be gathering locations that offer educational seminars and workshops. This means it facilitates get-togethers and discussions among learners, which in turn assist their learning development. As the result, local people would perceive libraries as a place to receive help, as well as acknowledge others' difficulties and support them. Ċ Secondly, libraries contain physical books are generally more credible than the Internet. This is because before a book is published, there are strict procedures that authors need to follow. After that, that book is going through peer review and proofread. All these steps are to ensure that the information provided is reliable. On the other hand, Internet is more relaxed in terms of restriction, which leads to some websites providing writer's opinions rather than proved facts. The inconsistent of information accuracy results in the readers being confused or believing in incorrect data. Ċ In conclusion, even with the growing popularity of the Internet, I absolutely believe in the importance of maintaining and developing public libraries. Not only do they promote a strong relationship within the community, they are also the most reliable source of information."
11010,Some people think that keeping pets is good for children while others think it is dangerous and unhealthy. Discuss both options and give examples. Which opinion do you agree with?,"Nowadays, people tend to keep an animal in the house for a good company to the kids. While some believe that it is beneficial for children, some even think there are safety issues. Although there are arguments, I radically believe, it is always a good option to have a pet. This essay will discuss the views and explain why I think so. Ċ To begin with, there are always some advantages of having an animal or bird in the house. Firstly, children are very much attached to these innocent creatures, hence they develop a beautiful relationship, which is beyond description. In other words, kids may grow such a strong bond with the pet that they protect and take care of each other. Secondly, they could be a loyal company to their owners. For example, a dog in Japan, waited long 10 years for his dead master to come back to show his loyalty, instead of forgetting him. Therefore, it is always been a good decision to have a faithful creature in order to support and give a fellowship to the family. Ċ On the other hand, sometimes it could be threatening to youngsters. There are some animals who do not want to be adopted by nature. They could be harmful sometimes if people try to keep them in their place. A snake, for instance, could anytime attack a person, if not noticed properly. Also, even peaceful animals like dog or cat could be vicious in certain circumstances, when they are disturbed or irritated, they could try to bite or scratch to protect themselves. Consequently, many families try to avoid these types of accidents. However, most of the pet animals are worth keeping. Ċ In conclusion, this essay has discussed both views and gave reasons. Though both have pros and cons, I reckon that kids enjoy a company of an innocent living and are attracted to them, so it is a good idea of having one of them in the house."
11011,"IELTS Writing Task 2 Nowadays urban sprawl is considered to pose serious problems. At the same time the idea of having your own house is very attractive. Give opinion, think of possible solution.","Historically big cities are often seen as places of great opportunities. But there are also some major drawbacks of living in a megalopolis. In my point of view, the problem of ever growing cities is a very controversial issue for either the government or an average person. Ċ The main aspect for someone who wants to migrate to a big city is the cost of living. Inhabitants of cities always have to pay higher price for housing, transport and even food. Another issue is that urban areas tend to suffer different social issues such as high crime rates or neighbours' inadequate behaviour. Furthermore, the air quality is getting worse even each day in the cities with highly developed industrial production. As a result, city life can be stressful and harmless for your health. Ċ However, there are couple of steps that the government can take to tackle these problems. First of all, for the controlling of enormously growing city areas the should take under regulation each and every new building in the city. Secondly, it is necessary to build green areas surrounding blocks of flats or a mall to soften the impact of poor air condition. The third option can be to develop provincial towns, rural areas and villages, by moving some industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressure on major cities and prevent them from uncontrolled sprawling. More than that, the undeveloped and rural areas are the best places for building your own separate house. Ċ In conclusion, urban sprawl tends to become the key problem of the ongoing XXI century. Governments could certainly implement a range of measures to enhance the quality of life for all city residents and organise sustainable development of city's territory in the future."
11012,some people believe that governments must spend more money to build more schools in isolated areas but other think that providing instruments to access the internet for the online class. because in developing countries fail to access education to all. two views will examine and tell your opinion.,"The accessibility of study to all children is one of the most significant subjects that governments should undoubtedly disperse to all its' areas. The best method to provide these facilities is one of the controversies that require the best consideration. There is a belief that building abundant schools for each region must be the target, though others would strongly recommend making the internet achievable for every kid would be more beneficial. However, in my opinion, although both views would make obvious improvement in each society, there are some facts which require attention to choose a better route. Ċ In some developing countries, schooling for each member of the society, especially the younger generation, can be considered a major concern. Building enough amenities for teaching might be a fine solution. Otherwise, school gatherings might take place even without any roof on them. Therefore, it is obvious, having every day class is due to weather conditions. Such as some cities in the south of Iran. Ċ The other attempt could be making electrical gadgets and the internet free and accessible for every student. Consequently, that can be one easy way in which each child, unrelated to his/her location, can connect and learn online by either educational software or recorded online classes, without any necessity of physical attendance. Though, the government should be able to apply wireless connections and computers available for every kid. Not to mention that it relies on their sufficient budget . Moreover, if people have problems handling their daily needs for food, literacy for their families is not going to be their priority. Therefore, it is possible, they would sell those products for their other needs. For instance, a city called Sistan in the south of Iran that they even have no electricity on a daily basis. Ċ It can be said that both having no burden on inaccessible educational buildings and gadgets for teaching online, would definitely help society to become illiterate. Overall, in some developing countries, there are some more major issues, for example, insufficient medical care, homeless people, and hunger. Therefore, for addressing literacy their policy relies on many other factors to come to a conclusion for the best option."
11013,"The Internet is now used all around the world as a source of information and communication. However, it's often controversial, so many people think it needs to be controlled. Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.","One of the conspicuous trends of today’s modern world is a colossal upsurge in the use of the internet for communication and gaining knowledge but some individuals believe that it should be used in a controlled manner whereas others believe that there shouldn’t be any interruptions.I personally agree with the latter statement as misuse of online media is done to spread terror and crime. Ċ To begin with, the internet is a boon or bane nowadays is the most debatable and controversial topic.There is a deluge of arguments in favour of my stance. The most preponderance is that criminal activities nowadays has surged by the illegal use of various online platforms.This has lead to the formation of various cyber security agencies which can overview all the illegal activities going on these platforms.For instance, research conducted by Oxford University reveals that cybercrime has increased enormously so watch by international agencies is mandatory. Ċ Secondly,a lot of news circulated on social networking platforms are fake .Consequently,adequate checkback is important.For example, a survey conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology,Ranchi revealed that both public and private organisations should come forward to curb this practice and stringent measures should be taken against lawbreakers.Defamation of any political figure could be done by circulating fake news in such a situation involvement of police and judiciary is important to deliver justice to the affected person. Ċ In a nutshell, nowadays use of the internet is very important for educational and research purposes but in my ,opinion check back is crucial to maintain law and order or consequences of its negative outcome would be detrimental for the society in long term."
11014,The teaching situation of teacher and students in a classroom will no longer be exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? a threat for classroom existence?,"It is considered by some that the teaching and learning environment of teachers and pupils in a room in reality will disappear before 2050. In my opinion, I do not agree that there will no longer be any learning interactions between the two group of people in the real world, but the virtual classroom may somehow replace the functions of a physical classroom. Ċ Firstly, technology becoming more advanced may be the main reason leading to the disappearance of teachers teaching in a classroom. The invention of different communication applications favours the exchange of ideas online, through the Internet in any place at any time, which lowers the importance and uniqueness of a real classroom. In other words, applications like Skype, Facetime or even other teaching and learning websites can link up teachers and students conveniently, allowing them to meet and interact at their homes or offices, without needing them to gather together at the same place. Ċ However, the importance of the existence of classrooms cannot be ignored, as they provide a platform for people to socialise and learn to get along with others, which this cannot be fulfilled and replaced by online learning sites or lesson videos. Teachers are not only teaching what are told in textbooks, but also the manners and communication skills which are essential to students. To illustrate, students are learning to respect teachers and classmates when having regular face-to-face lessons in the classroom. Such vital skills required as an individual living in the society ensure the stable and unreplaceable position of real classroom. Ċ In conclusion, classrooms will still exist for a long time in the next few centuries as places for teachers to teach and students to learn, since new popular learning methods, in particular the commonly used of the Internet, can only take up part of the functions of classrooms."
11015,Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas. Ċ In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way. Ċ Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily. Ċ To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice."
11016,some people say that the main purpose of television should be education; while others say that it should be for entertainment only.discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is generally believed that the learning educational skills should be the paramount role imparted by the means of television. Although this is favoured by some, others counter argument that telly should be solely used for relaxation and enjoyment. In my perspective, both the purposes are solved by the TV set, and play an equal role in nurturing an individual. This essay will delve into both these aspects with relevant examples in support of my view. Ċ To begin with, it is globally accepted that media box is an essential virtual platform for edifying new knowledge of the surrounding sitting at one place. This technological product has enabled the all concerned to learn hobbies, manners, historical events, ongoing global happenings. For instance, The Epic channel showcases the episode of the past happenings and are really beneficial for students to learn from these in the pictographs and visualising manner. Furthermore, the advertisements telecasted on the TV have a great impact on the minds of the individuals, as they are mainly related to daily habits and social taboos. Thus, the small media are enhancing the educational aspect by running episodes of subject matter and the social content in an effective way. Ċ On the other hand, considering television only as a source of entertainment and relaxation is regarded as an argument by some. Watching movies, programmes, listening to songs can be relaxing to one's soul and the small technological automation has proved the best to serve the individuals need by telecasting the taste of the people globally. This vogue is dispensable as it acts as a source of entertainment by providing them with the content of contentment. For an illustration, a survey conducted recently revealed that 70 percent of the people globally prefer to watch television to divert them from the hectic work schedule. Moreover, today the smart TV is capable of recording our favourite programmes, which we can enjoy later on in our leisure time; it also offers thousand of games to play. Hence it is inevitable from the lives of the individuals as it provides a rich source of soaps, songs to rejuvenate. Ċ To conclude, I strongly agree that the shaping the educational skills as well as for the rejuvenation purpose TV plays an indispensable role. However, to use it solely for educational and fun motive would be wrong."
11017,"Some parents allow their teenage children to live independently, away from home. Other parents don’t want their teenage children to live away from them. Which do you think is better and why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer","Parents around the world have different styles of raising their children, some may be strict and others may be lenient. A number of teenagers are allowed to live by themselves, far away from home, whilst others are under close supervision of their parents. In my opinion, I think kids should not be permitted to live independently and I will give reasons to support my position in this essay. Ċ Firstly, teenagers can be carefree, irresponsible and with little or no experience about life, they make wrong decisions. Allowing an adolescent to be completely self-reliant is a disaster waiting to happen. For instance, teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise due to children who lack parental guidance. However, some exceptions may be allowed when teenagers live independently in boarding schools under the supervision of teachers and mentors. Ċ Secondly, studies have shown that teenagers who lived with their parents until their early twenties turn out to make better life choices than those who lived alone from the age of thirteen upwards. For example, adolescents who stay with their parents do not concern themselves with accommodation or their next meal which poses as a distraction to their academic lives. Whereas, those who live alone are plagued by these concerns. This shows that parental guidance is important in shaping the life of a young adult. Ċ In conclusion, teenagers should be allowed to remain under close supervision of their parents in order to help them become responsible adults in the future. Even though some parents tolerate their wards to be self-reliant with the purpose of making them mature quickly, it does come with a lot or risks. Parents should be fully present in parenting their children until they are old enough to live responsibly."
11018,"The Internet provides us with information about life and cultures of different the countries, and some people say it is not necessary to visit these countries to learn about them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and relevant examples.","These days, modern people are willing to explore new places, learn about other cultures and travel around the world. In this regard, advanced technologies can provide the people with information about the nations or places through the internet, leading to gain some information about their culture, social life and art. However, some people believe that individuals should visit the countries in order to learn about their lifestyle. Personally, I believe that travellers should visit the new places, as they cannot receive enough dates though the net. Ċ On the other hand, it is true that visiting the countries may be beneficial for personal development. The tourists can enhance their interpersonal skills, during the conversation with local communities. Furthermore, travelling will give the life experience. To illustrate, tourists are supposed to overcome many obstacles to get the point of destination, such as inconvenience of transport, lack of money and inability to speak a foreign language. In addition, they will be able to tell about their trip to other people in the future. Ċ On the other hand, travelling can pollute the world. In this case, the most essential thing is a transportation, as planes, trains and cars are dangerous for the environment. In this reason, many individuals believe that gaining knowledge about the other culture, though the social networking sites are beneficial for the surrounding world. Moreover, this method can also save the wild animals, as due to travelling, many species of animals become extinct. For example, the African Leon extinction is caused by the tourism, as many foreign people are keen to hunt this animal. Ċ In conclusion, although many people tend to think that the online resources can replace the travelling, in my opinion, visiting new countries and places are beneficial for the citizens, as it can develop their soft skills. In addition, they will gain a life experience."
11019,To what extent do you agree that people in high positions should get paid more than those in lower positions.,"In the contemporary era, people tend to take for granted the income gap between employees with different positions in companies or organizations. On the other hand, disputes concerning the financial distinction in society are getting increasingly heated. In my opinion, while paying workers based on their occupational levels is reasonable, the government should put emphasis on the fair distribution of social wealth to avoid the widening gap between the rich and the poor. Ċ From the perspective of employers and corporations, it is necessary to distinguish employees' wages on the basis of their positions. This means that managers taking charge of certain major programmes are supposed to get more rewards than those who just follow the orders. It is obviously because leaders tend to have more responsibility in the team, such as making plans in advance, organizing personnel and resources, and always being prepared for any unexpected circumstances to ensure the implementation of projects. These arduous tasks can impose heavier burdens on high-status employees both physically and mentally. By contrast, ordinary workers have less to be bothered, if they can receive clear instructions from their managers and cooperate with colleagues to address problems in a joint effort. Therefore, it is reasonable that the former get more salaries than the latter. Ċ Nonetheless, countries should be alarmed about the trend that individuals with high social status are being paid too much, while disadvantaged groups are quite the opposite. In many cases, this is an unhealthy development in the distribution of social wealth. Since the well-offs have already possessed a huge amount of social resources, they can use their power and influence to make more profit, which could further take away the cake that could have been consumed by the poor. For instance, some large organizations pour money into developing the logistic chain to deliver fresh fruits and vegetables to customers who do the purchasing online; such a commercial activity could have a devastating impact on vegetable markets where small-hold farmers used to sell their products to make a living. If governments stepped aside from this phenomenon, the less advantaged ones would find it harder to sustain and survive, since the favourable resources have been taken up by those who have more power and higher status. Ċ To conclude, I believe that in the job market where staff compete for higher salaries according to their responsibility and the effort that they put into their work, distinguishing earning based on positions is understandable; however, on the social scale, the priority should be removed the unfair resource allocation to prevent high-status ones from getting paid too much."
11020,"Topic: some people argue that companies and private individuals, not government, should pay the bill of environmental pollution cleaning up. To what extent do you agree or disagree.","As we all known, the main duty of government is to improve citizen's living standards. Therefore, some people maintain that it is the government that should be responsible for eliminating the pollution to promote our living condition. Instead of the government, however, I would argue that companies and individuals should be charged for the payment of cleaning pollution up. Ċ The major reason is that the payment from companies and individuals can effectively help to get rid of pollution. Companies and individuals have to change their environmentally unfriendly ways of operating and living to be greener, if the payment for cleaning takes a main part of their incomes. For example, in some countries, such as China, manufacturing companies are asked for paying plenty of money to eliminate the negative effects of industrial wasted gases. So they have already improved their manufacturing methods with less wasted gases emission. As a consequent, the air pollution in industrial areas has been better than before. Ċ Although the government gains the amount of tax revenue from companies and citizens, it can hardly afford the expense on solving the environmental problems. Except eliminating pollution there are a great number of more important issues, such starvation and poverty, needed to be solved by the government. Especially in some developing and less developed countries, the government there has to spend their revenue purchasing food and building infrastructure to make their people survive and be far away from poverty. Therefore, the government is unable to eliminate pollution by paying a lot of money. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that companies and individuals should pay for eliminating pollution, but the government also has the duty to make appropriate policies to lead their people to work and live in a green way."
11021,some people think that a person improves their intellectual skills more when doing group activity to what extend do you agree,"In today's fast-growing world, intellectual skills are required by each individual to sustain. Many people think that one can improve their communication skills by involving more in group activities. This essay will discuss why it is beneficial to take a share in different activities which include more people. Ċ Having good communication skills gives you an extra edge over others. You can develop these skills when you get involved with other people through some work. In other words, when you take part in group activities, you tend to increase your confidence which can help you in other fields. For example, I was an introvert in my schools days due to which I had very low confidence while talking to others, but when I joined the school drama club, all my shyness disappeared. This actually helped me develop my personality. Ċ However, there can be a chance that one might not be comfortable in groups with a lot of people. This can actually worsen the condition of that person. They may lose whatever ability they had in the first place. Furthermore, some group activities are done just for namesake and do not have any benefits. For instance, some HR activities involve employees are mandatory for everyone. Employees just take part in them in order to finish them and not enjoy them. Overall, just opening your personality in front of others can help you in building self-confidence. Ċ In conclusion, although there can be some ill-effects of doing company activities. Nevertheless, I believe that these things can significantly improve the intellectual skills of the people taking part in them."
11022,Essay about technology. An increasing number of people are now using the internet to meet new people and socialise. Some people think this has brought people closer together while others think people are becoming more isolated. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"It is widely acknowledged that the Internet has transformed the way that people communicate with others. Some argued that people are more likely to feel lonely, while others claimed that the internet enables individuals to connect closely. This essay will discuss both these points of view and argue in favor of the latter. Ċ It might be claimed that the massive usage of smartphones and social media could contribute to loneliness. The main reason is people often pay attention to their mobile phones rather than engage in face-to-face interaction with a friend who sits next to them, which poses a threat to relationships in real life. According to the latest study conducted by the ministry of health in Taiwan, one-third of people suffered from mental illness, such as loneliness, because of addiction to social media. Ċ In contrast, there are several reasons why the internet is considered beneficial to socialize. To begin with, it allows people to contact others regardless of geographical distance. That is to say, because of the development of the internet, people can easily send a message or a mail to their friends or relatives who live in different cities, or even other nations. Facebook, for example, enables users to chat or have a free call to their friends around the world, which helps to cultivate friendships. Moreover, owing to social networking, single people can simply have a date with each other and foster romantic relationships. For example, in 2019 it was reported in The New York Times that over 30% of Americans have met their partner online. Ċ In conclusion, although it is undeniable that the internet may make people feel a sense of isolation in some ways, I believe that if people use it properly, they will develop intimate relationships and connections."
11023,"There are many extinct animals’ species in the world. Some people think we should protect animals from dying out, while others believe we should spend more time on problems of human beings. Ċ Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","A lot of species have extinct in recent years. It is been argued by some people that time should be dedicated towards their protection others oppose and state that time should be given to address the human-related issues. Animals should be protected as they are a part of our ecosystem while the welfare of humans should be kept in mind. I strongly believe that issues of both animals and humans can be solved simultaneously. In this essay, why to address the problems of animals and humans will be discussed. Ċ To begin with, animals are a part of our ecosystem and this ecosystem should be in balance always. Animal’s extinction disturbs this balance which can lead to issues affecting the environment in which humans thrive. For instance, if lions are extinct, the deers can grow in number and could pose a threat to the vegetation and grasslands. Hence, to maintain the equilibrium, the animal’s survival must be defended. Ċ On the contrary, problems of human beings must be curbed in order to have a stable ecological community. If human issues remained unattended, stability could jeopardize. For example, if the hunger issue is ignored then the existence of the human race will face difficulties. Thus, to maintain a balanced ecological community the human issues must be attended. Ċ In summary, the worries of both humans and animals should be addressed hand in hand because both are part of the food chain which must be maintained. One’s extinction will pose a threat to the other’s survival. In my opinion, there is no compelling reason that the animal’s problem could not be attended alongside humans."
11024,music should not be taught in schools instead other subjects such as computers and science should be taught. do you agree or disagree with this statement? teaching science and technology instead of music,"it is argued that art lesson, especially music, is not allowed to be put in curriculum when teachers teach in school, some people think information technology and science more important to be learnt by youngster today. this essay will discuss about why science and technology should be learnt more in educational institution. Ċ According to urgency level between music and computer technology and science, music is not too urgent to be taught in school. it is because development of technology is increasing in this modern world, people are demanded to know how to operate digital devices such as smartphone, vending machine, and laptop. moreover, in the near future, all daily activities are connected into the internet. one great example to describe this situation is people now be able to order food through smartphone. Ċ beside that, learning music can be done in everywhere. people can learn music not only in school but also in the cyberspace. there are a lot of websites, which provide information about how to play guitar or how to read block note, to be accessed anywhere and anytime. Grace Vanderwaal is a great example to describe this condition. she won a singer competition, after she studied about playing an ukulele from Youtube. Ċ to sum up, because of development of technology always increase day-by-day, people should prepare themselves to be able to operate high-tech. therefore, school should include science and technology to curriculum instead of music lesson."
11025,Many people believe that individuals over 65 should not be allowed to continue working. Others think that people should be allowed to work for as long as they choose. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"A highly controversial issue today relates to whether elderly people should not work anymore or not. In this essay, I am going to examine this question from both points of view and then give my own perspective on the matter. Ċ There are people who argue that the benefits of stop working when over 65 years considerably outweigh its disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is that they could not be exposed to some problems in the business environment anymore such as a high level of stress. It is also possible to say that they have worked a lot and need to rest and enjoy their life from now on. One good illustration of this is that people usually work their entire life hoping to be able to retire and spend their time travelling and resting with their grandchildren. Ċ On the other hand, others believe that older people are still able to keep working. It is often argued that some of them have enough health condition to work and only stop when they choose it. People often have this opinion because many of them, in general, continue to have the strength and patience to execute their role for many years along. A second point is that a lot of workers above 65 years old do not have sufficient money to survive without a job. A particularly good example here is in poor countries where they could spend their entire life working and still have bad life condition, being not able to survive only with their retirement money that, in general, are low. Ċ In conclusion, I believe both arguments have their merits. On balance, however, I feel that they should keep working. Although their advanced age, they still able to define what they want to do and only they could choose when to stop or not, it is a freedom right."
11026,"Do you agree or disagree that the government should require all young adults to perform some kind of national service, such as military service and social work","Your mom, one day, said loudly "" Hey my son Military writ is came for you"" Then Some young men think that it is my duty, for another one who say to himself whether the government necessary require it? while, if were they, I strongly will agree that the government should require young adults to perform some kind of national work, specially military service, for following below reasons. Ċ Military service can provide physical improvement. All of young adults except already have fulfill the military service, have a weak physical. Because they are just 17 or 18 at this time. For example; before my brother go to military service, we used to wrestle everyday and I always won. However, after he arrived, I can't win him. Ċ Moreover, Military service is give chance that young adults discover themselves. By this time that military, they need to recognize themselves. Most young adults begin interesting everything that they don't know at this time. So, They seduction into the bad habits sometimes, such as alcohol, marijuana, and drug and others. That is why Military service need to them and give chance. Ċ Finally, one of the most important reason that I agree, Military service teach how can I real man and independence adult. What is it mean? All high school never teach about be brave, durability and doggedness in life. Ċ In conclusion, I feel that Military service need to all young adults and government should require all young adults to perform military service. Consequently, Military Service which is can help you to learn new experience, new lifestyle and it is become beginning your new world."
11027,Prompt: In some countries students who misbehave have to leave the school and are not allowed to continue their education. In other countries they can return to their studies after a suspension period. Discuss both options and give your opinion.,"Policies at school are tend to assure that everyone is doing the right thing.In addition, punishment policies are existed in order to deal with any kind of abuse or any wrong activity. No one can deny the fact that those policies must be strong. However, the main aim of all policies is to prevent misbehaves but not to get revenge. Ċ On the first hand, we must acknowledge that termination from school is a very effective policy. In other words, students that misbehave will be dismissed from school. As a result, this may lead to ruining the student's life. At least it will have a very bad effect on his/her educational path. At the same time, educationalists chose termination rules in order to be strong enough, so that all students will be afraid of making mistakes. Hence, they will rarely misbehave. Ċ On the second hand, some schools adopt a less restricted punishment policies.For instance, a timed suspension has a very good balance between law enforcement and preserving the value of the student, so that a student can continue his/her educational path after a period of reconsideration. Moreover, this time tend to be a recovery time for the student that will be back in the right direction. Ċ At last, weather schools' policies implementation were pessimistic like termination or optimistic like suspension. They are just rules to prevent any wrong activity and keep everything on the road."
11028,Nowadays there is an increase in social problems involving young people because more parents spent time at work than with their children. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"It is irrefutable that parents play an imperative role in influencing child’s behaviour. In recent days, social concerns involving teenagers have been rising at an exponential pace due to the matter that the guardians are spending less time with their kids than at work. I personally agree with this statement to a large extent and will elucidate my views in the following paragraphs. Ċ There are several attributes to this concern. To embark on, most of the adolescents face Isolation. In other words, due to the case that guardians spend a very limited amount of time with their offspring, they often tend to play computer games and mass media consequently getting influenced by violent. For instance, a recent toll conducted by researchers state that kids with single parent face more number of crime and other social problems in the society. Furthermore, As most of parents are in a rat race to win a luxurious lifestyle, they tend to forget inculcating moral values to kids, thus most of them lack soft skills like team spirit, cooperation and tolerance. Ċ On a contrary, when youths are provided with freedom, most of them try to learn challenges and overcome them. Also, they try to be more independent due to the evidence that most of them solve their problems. To add on, It provides a platform for the teenagers to express their own ideas and emotions. Which indirect them to follow their passion instead of learning suggested by parents. To illustrate an example, Ranjit and Edwin are few among the individuals who have followed their passion without parents' guidance and have been successful in life. Ċ In conclusion, Despite the evidence that few individuals can express their ideas and emotions without the guidance of parents. Parents should spend a considerable amount of time with children, to nurture them in an effective way by inculcating variety of soft skills which in turns help them to become better citizens of society."
11029,"In some countries, it is thought advisable that children begin formal education at four years old, while in others they do not have to start school until they are seven or eight. Ċ How far do you agree with either of these view.","The early you learn, the early you begin. Many nations are encouraging academic learnings from the beginning of their birth. Others, however,believe that one should not make them occupied in define training and can make them disinterest in future teachings. In this essay, I will elicit upon the rational supporting my views then only I will give my opinion. Ċ To begin with, initial learnings is very essential in one's life and by introducing structured tuition may inculcate various required skills among the juvenile, such as being confident and having good communication, it is very well proven by the researcher that from the age of 0 to 5years old kid, their brain function three times faster than the adult and this is the best time to get them acquainted with vital studies. As much as the teaching they get to explore, it aids them in getting familiar with things around. To exemplify, it was said by the world richest man Mr Bill gate that the initial 5 years of a human being, decide the next 85 years of their life and this has been followed by various parents around the globe. Ċ On the other hand, there is a small section of society which have a different point of view. The kids should learn on their own and should not restrict to the school preparation , this may stop them from being creative. Such pedagogy commonly pressurised the toddlers and may result in less interest in university education when actually needed. To illustrate, according to the survey done by the University of Delhi, most of the kids do not like the early tutions and more interested in extra curriculum activities only. Ċ To conclude, in my opinion,I firmly believe that early preparation makes youngster fast learner and a good performer in their exams and which eventually give them a bright future ahead."
11030,"More and more people are using computers and electronic devices to access information. Hence, printing of newspapers and magazines should be stopped. Do you agree or disagree?","In this contemporary era, there is a lot of value in technological assets which subsequently make work succeeds very quickly and conveniently. Some people say that the handling of printed paper should be abandoned. Although I agree that the adoption of technological tools is very helpful in today's work, the importance of printed writing cannot be denied. Ċ Firstly, it would be fair to say that with the advancement of technological assets, our lives have become much more convenient. Electronic devices and computers have made it much faster to do the daily work in our lives by making it very convenient to be able to investigate any subject from home on computer and internet instead of travelling to do research. For example, many of the organizations in India, such as Tata and Microsoft, have branches all over the world, can make wise and prudent decisions by discussing any business at home. Additionally, in the old days, it was almost impossible to achieve onerous tasks, whereas now the solutions to the most difficult ones are easily found through technological advancement. Ċ However, we must not forget the benefits of printed prints. Printed booklet, newspapers, novels have a place of their own ,therefore cannot be left out. Our elders and grandparents are only interested in the value of antiques and they prefer to read newspapers and booklets only. For example, ancient scriptures like Ramayana and Guru Granth Sahib are considered by our forefathers to be the source of culture and religiosity of the country and reading through books is the only way to one's spiritual development. In addition, due to the generation gap, the people of old times are reluctant to use today's technological resources consequently, they tend to use stuff that runs in their time. Ċ Lastly, I reiterate that the evolution of technological devices has made our life much easier but on the contrary, the value of famous things in ancient times cannot be left behind because people related to our background are fundamental to be connected with antique printings as they see compatibility, on that account should never be forgotten."
11031,"Some people say that parents should places restrictions on the hours their children spend watching TV and playing computer games, and encourage them to spend this time reading books instead. Do you agree or disagree?","It has been a ubiquitous phenomenon that most children use their free time to play video games or watch TV in the current society. Some people advocate that parents should allow children to read more books and restrict them from using technology products. Which approach would be the most suitable for children? This essay will discuss my view in detail with supporting examples. Ċ On the one hand, there is a proclivity to believe that children who watch too much TV and play video games will have a detrimental effect. Mainly this is because these TV shows and video games are easy to get addicted to them. For instance, video games usually design a lot of levels that allow players to spend considerable time to solve them, and TV shows are highly entertaining, that makes children reluctant to leave. As a result, there would undoubtedly be a significant impact on children's physical and mental health when parents' do not set up restrictions on video games and TV time. Ċ In addition, one should consider that children can benefit from reading, such as increasing reading speed, learning more words, and developing an abundant imagination. In other words, the description of the story can help children to create different pictures and sounds in their minds, which can improve their creativity. Take my own story as an example: when I was a child, I like reading detective novels because the descriptions in the books were highly vivid. I would imagine myself how to crack the case if I was the detective in the book. Therefore, such influence would definitely have a valuable contribution to children's character training, which may even affect their future learning and career development. Ċ In conclusion, albeit limiting children's time on TV and video games may deprive them of their fun, it would be more beneficial in their life in the long run. In my view, if parents show as a role model to turn off the TV and read books with their children, they would naturally cultivate reading habits from an early age."
11032,Some people think government should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help people prevent illness and disease. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"No doubt, people’s well-being is influenced by the environment and housing conditions. That is why some people opine that governments should focus more on the environment and housing to prevent various ailments. While I do admit that these areas require attention, in my opinion, by simply addressing environmental abuse and housing scarcity, we cannot see much of an improvement in public health. Ċ Indeed, environmental pollution and dirty surroundings cause many fitness problems. For example, air pollution is a major issue in cities and consequently many urban residents suffer from respiratory ailments. Lack of access to clean water is another problem that millions of people face in poor countries. Unhealthy surroundings are the breeding grounds of mosquitoes and fleas which spread many diseases. Therefore, if the government looks into environmental pollution and provides basic housing, amenities such problems can be avoided to a great extent. Ċ Nevertheless, simply focusing on the environment and housing will not prevent all diseases. The government has to do much more. It has to allocate a portion of its budget to prevent diseases through vaccinations. It should also spend on screening tests through which serious diseases such as cancer can be detected long before actual symptoms occur. In earlier stages most cancers are totally curable through inexpensive treatments. Launching health awareness campaigns are another thing governments can do to improve public strength. Even if the authority provides housing for all, diseases can still spread if people are ignorant and allow stagnant water to collect in their surroundings. Ċ In conclusion, although giving priority to environmental issues and housing will improve public health, a lot more has to be done to eradicate diseases. The ministry, for example, has to launch fitness awareness campaigns, provide free vaccinations and regular energy checkups to ensure that people live a healthy and long life."
11033,"Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree？","My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs. Ċ Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system. Ċ Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all. Ċ To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life."
11034,"Some people think that the best way to improve road safety is by reducing the maximum speed limit on vehicles, others think there are other better ways. Discuss both sides and give your opinion","How to ameliorate safety in roads is becoming the debatable issue in which some individuals have an opinion that minimising the speed of automobiles will be an effective idea, while others contend that other means of alternatives should be implemented to mitigate such trouble. I shall discuss both these views before coming to a reasonable conclusion. Ċ To commence with, diminishing the race limit would be the first and foremost strategy to overcome this problem. Firstly, if one keeps in mind the speed limit while travelling then the chances of accidents and casualties might be very little or nil. For example, the automation department demonstrates that the main reason behind road mishappenings or accidents have been because of fast driving in which pupils to reach their destinations on time drive rapidly and in turn bear consequences. Secondly, lowering race will ultimately help masses to monitor their vehicle on journeys as easily and comfortably driving would be ensured by following that method. Therefore, excursions without the aim of reaching early would be most beneficial and efficient to ensure safety which ultimately saves precious lives. Ċ On the contrary, some who argues to follow other means say that there should be complete rules and restrictions for individuals to not to drive while drinking in order to provide insurance to themselves as well as other humans. Moreover, provisions like to follow red lights and wearing helmets might be suggested to deliver a remedy for insurance. For instance, a report by the Ministry states that wearing helmets on bikes and seat belts on cars would be indeed essential for the survival to deter the occurrence of troubles. Thus, official bodies should charge fines and punish those who stand against these restrictions. Ċ To conclude According to me, along with slow driving it is also imperative to wear seat belts or helmets and not drink when anyone travels to deter the chances of casualties."
11035,"Throughout the history, male leaders often made the society more violent and conflicting. If women governed the world, it would be more peaceful world. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give an example to support your idea.","It is often argued that women leadership in society may bring the most peaceable sense. While it is true for some major reasons, I agree that men could be an eligible chief in keeping world peace. Ċ The decrease of international credence is caused by several national conflicts. Libya, Egypt and Syria are the notorious examples as Qhadafi, Asa'ad and Mubarak ways to conduct their country result on many terrible chaos. In this view, it seems to allow women who have leadership quality in endeavour peace to their county. Au San Suu Kyi, a political leader from Myanmar, has proved that woman has peaceful way to lead. Even though she is in powerful opposition in against military government who arrest her in unfair way in that era, she, further, could create stability around Myanmar in collaboration with the junta. Her steps, then, bestowed her as one of the peace Nobel Prize awardee. Ċ However, women could prove illusory as the best leader from womanhood as they way of leading depict violence and hostility. Margaret Thatcher who ordered British Navy to conquer Falkland Island from Argentina is stance stronger as an obvious example. As results of this force, many victims died and the protest from world peace-lover around the world raised. Apart from the execrable example, history told Mahatma Gandhi as one of the inspiration in leading with peace. He leads in complex struggle to show his basic precepts Ahimsa, no violence, and Satyagraha, resistance from foreign helps. Gandhi proves that leading on against not always use weapon and bomb. Together with Suu Kyi, Gandhi success to become Nobel awardee and also become the symbol of peace. Ċ In conclusion, although women might appropriate to become leader owing to their success in shunning violence, based on the historical fact, I believe that men are too capable to become peacekeeping leader."
11036,Topic: Usually directors are paid much higher salaries than simple workers. Some people agree with this but other believe it is unfair. Discuss both views and give your own opinion on the topic.,"Most of big corporation's CEO salary is incomparable to that of ordinary workers. Some people believe that they are deserved to earn it because of their high education, responsibility and skills while others are against of it. In this essay, I will examine both sides of view and present my personal opinion on this matter. Ċ On the one hand, it is a true that most directors have higher education than its staffs. It is a face that when people's education level increases, rate of earning also rises, even directors are exemption. They are highly likely to have tertiary education from top universities. Furthermore, responsibility they shoulder is much heavy than others. Decision they made about business is matter of failure or success. They bear higher responsibility while competing in the stiff market. Therefore, their responsibility should be equivalent to their salary. Similarly, they are much skillful than others by acquiring leadership and communication skills that are vital for negotiations and deals. Ċ On the other hand, some people strongly oppose the high earning of top directors. It is probably because ordinary workers execute main parts of job while director are less aware of operation. For example, in power plant, electrical engineer is main person for operation of generating electricity, not directors since engineer know day-to-day function of factory. Moreover, ordinary could be distinguished from directors by their less ambitious character. Thereby some people believe that high salary should be paid to ambitious, less responsibly and talkative directors. Ċ In the conclusion, I am convinced that it would be Fairless if director's salary is equal to simple workers. Their earning must be higher than others because their knowledge, skills, practice and reputation are significant parts of corporation's growth and future."
11037,Most countries are compared by their economic success. Do you think there are some other important factors that need to be taken into consideration? Give your opinion and relevant examples,"Economic is consider one of most important factor in the classification of the countries, I think nobody can deny or refuse this idea , but the peoples have many view points about assuming this factor, is this the only one to compare or there are another factors ? Ċ In the first place, there are al lot of people believe economic must be the only thing to decide which countries is the best, because the economic has a power to change financial live for people by give them many opportunity for jobs, beside this economic can far away the problems of unemployment such like grime etc ,and the poor countries can be good example for this relationship between unemployment and grime. Ċ But in second place, another people believes there are another factors must be put side by side with economic , like freedom, education, healthy and comfortable live for people. as example for this idea the second economic in the world I mean China have not enough freedom and many people in prison because their opinions while the best country for live is the Norway, and this country not in first or second even third in arrangement economic countries. Ċ as a result , I think as we modern society we should look for new standards to choose which is the best country and this standard must have different factors like economic, freedom, education, healthy also pollution level , and result for these we can decide which country is the best ,also by this way we can push countries to do the best to them citizens."
11038,"Advertising is now becoming more popular in modern society. While some people believe this is a positive development, others see it as a negative one. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","It is claimed that advertising has a vital role in our daily life. While there are strong arguments against advertisements, I still believe that advertising is beneficial to consumerism in various ways. Ċ On the one hand, there are several drawbacks of ads that should not be underestimated. One major negative is that advertising manipulates people. For example, advertisement stimulates communityCorrect article usagethe communityIt seems that there is an article usage problem here. Ċ show examples for impulsive buying by providing different promotional offers that lead to buying goods without function. Ads also create an artificial want, which persuades individuals to seek for what they don't really need. But through advertising, some companies provide exaggerated and unrealistic reviews of their products so people are cheated by such marketing tricks. Moreover, it only highlights the positive characteristics of a product and tries to hide its negative aspects Ċ On the other hand, I would agree with those who believe that advertising could bring us many advantages. One of the main purposes is that advertising is a key part of modern business. Advertising is an effective way of spreading awareness among people about the use of new and existing products. For instance, if a cloth store offers a discount on its items, consumers will know the deal through billboards or TV ads. Furthermore, it enables the customers to compare a product with other competitive products available in the market so that they decide whether a product is worth buying or not. In addition, for busy citizens that do not have time for shopping, advertising will help them to make their minds."
11039,"Earlier, people wore cloths which were related to their culture but now people people wear the same type of cloths all over the world. Is this a positive or negative development?","The globalization has had a predominant impact on the people’s lives; especially for their attires. In the past, the people were used to wear their conventional cloths influenced by their culture; while in globalized village, the diversity in costumes has been faded. Such enhancement in fashion is beneficial to the mankind and the supporting arguments are discussed further. Ċ To begin with, the most lucrative side of the common types of cloths is that the discrimination among the people based on cast, religion, colour, wealth and nationality has been faded. Such revolutionary practice plays a vital role to build harmony in the society, which is the most essential element for the sustainable development. For instance, in the eighteenth century the dress code of a layman was decided based on the social taboo and religion, which was the clear violation of the human right. Thus, by wearing similar attire all over the world, the people are representing the global culture of the developed society. Ċ Moreover, the similar dressing sense of the people make them more comfortable with each other. The traveller in abroad could interact with the native people with an ease, if they have some common factor between them such as an attire, then they feel quite familiar with the situations. For example, the tourist in India can easily indulge with the local people due to common attire. Although people wear their traditional clothes in festivals and marriage ceremony, for their own rigorous and social beliefs. Thus, the culture can be preserved with the development of the society by avoiding radical practices in routine life. Ċ In conclusion, the advancement in the human being has changed the dressing sense of an individual dramatically. This change in fashion is a first step towards the bonding between the people and the social equality. The society is not only benefited due this practice, but also the future generations will have fruitful results."
11040,"Task2:Some say that learning to play a music instrument is a waste of time, agree or disagree?","The role of musicians has brought many arguments in a society. One topic of discussion is the amount of time spent on learning musical instruments. Many people claim that it is just a waste of time, I firmly oppose to this statement. In this essay we will be discussing how teaching oneself discipline and gaining self-confidence as a result of learning to play an instrument could be beneficial to an individual. Ċ Learning an instrument is not as easy as it sounds. A person needs commitment and dedication to be successful .Thus, discipline is a key requirement to achieve good results. For instance, learning a guitar cannot be accomplished overnight, it is essential to spend at least two hours daily for your practice. This shows that you have taught to discipline yourself in the aspect of time management. Ċ Being able to play an instrument makes you feel better about yourself and it gives you a sense of belongingness. An example is heard from stories of most talent show candidates like America's Got Talent. In real life they are struggling their way for survival and they feel unworthy of themselves. But once they are on stage playing an instrument, it is like living a dream for them. This makes them feel special about themselves and thus they have gained self-confidence. Ċ Both aspects shown above clearly proves that learning a musical instrument brings positive results to oneself. Therefore, it is unrightful to claim that time spent on practicing an instrument is wasted. In fact, it is considered as an investment for self-improvement."
11041,The movement of people from agricultural areas to cities to work can cause serious problems in both places. What are the serious problems? What measures can be used to solve these problems?,"In recent years, more and more people are migrating from rural areas to cities. This trend has detrimental effects on both agricultural as well as urban areas. This essay will discuss the problems associated with the movement of people and simultaneously suggest some measures to deal with the issues. Ċ To begin with, the relocation of people is having an adverse effect on both villages as well as cities. People moving out from crossroads is disturbing the agri-economy. This is causing a shortage of labour in agricultural fields, thus, affecting decreasing the agri-output of the country. Another problem associated with this migration is the degradation of natural resources. This is because land and water are overused as a result of a large number of people moving into the city. To illustrate, water quality in metropolitan cities like Toronto is reduced by 20% in the last few years. Therefore, the movement of people from small towns to developed areas is disadvantageous for both places. Ċ While the problems may seem intractable, there are measures that can be adapted to control them. Firstly, the reason for this migration is the job opportunities available in urban areas. Therefore, by providing equal job openings in the under-developed area can keep a check on this resettlement of individuals. For instance, the government can allocate subsidies to the industries to settle their plants in rural places and thus generating a job bank. Secondly, the development of public infrastructures like transport, shopping complexes, and health facilities could also refrain the people from moving. Ċ In conclusion, the migration of people is a complex problem to solve. This essay discussed a few of the drawbacks of this on the economy as well as natural resources. While issues are evidently clear, there are measures that can be taken to alleviate them."
11042,Reducing global environment damage should be handled by governments rather than individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree? responsibility for Reducing global environment damage,"Global environment is considered one of the most pressing problems of the 21st century. While some people believe that authorities have a paramount role to play in minimizing green issue . Even though, I strongly agree that the damage to the environment ought to be tackled by individual's attempt Ċ Firstly, the governments could make more attempts to reduce environmental damage. They can run factories and industries by introducing laws to limit the amount of emissions, so it will help to maintain and balance the ecological system . Moreover, authorities should take place ""green campaign"" programme for the purpose of raising awareness of our energy use . For example, Earth Hour is an annual global campaign that encourages people around the world to reduce global environmental hazards by switching off for at least one hour. Ċ On the other hand, nobody can deny the roles of individuals in the environmental protection process. The uncontrolled use of automobiles can caused global warming because it releases a wide range of polluted gases. Therefore, people can reduce harmful habits into environment by taking public transport instead of private cars. Furthermore, the citizens should join hands to deal with these issues by sorting the daily garbage , enhancing environmental awareness tree planting to yield a healthier atmosphere. Ċ In conclusion, if citizens do not to try to raise awareness of environment protection, we will give severe consequences. However, fully address the threat of global environmental damage; we must need a comprehensive combination of the government and individual."
11043,Some people prefer activities and lifestyles in hot climates while others prefer living in cold climates. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Some would argue that warm and sunny weather is better for living, while others believe that cold climate is perfect for doing activities and lifestyle. Although the freezing season produces different types of green vegetables which are beneficial for health, I personally believe that the summertime brings out the best of living because humans have emotions. Ċ On the one hand, winter is one of the best seasons when new vegetables and fruits grow tremendously. At this time healthy, leafy green vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, beans, and carrots become cheaper and poor people can effort them easily. Hence, This reduces the risk of becoming malnourished for nations. For example, in Bangladesh, in the winter season, farmers grow potatoes, broccoli, lemons, carrots and tomatoes and the price is almost ninety per cent less compared to the market value in other seasons. However, I personally think that cold,foggy and hazy environments do not bring the bright side of the human mood. Ċ On the other hand, whilst in the summer season individuals suffer from extreme sweating and use air conditioning, this time gives the best emotional state. On bright sunny days individuals do not need to stay inside, they can work out outside and can have a family picnic somewhere on a lovely beach. For instance, it has been seen that the number of visitors to the world largest sea beach Cox's Bazar is higher just after the winter and it show that people love to break the monotonous life of the cold period.Therefore, I am convinced that everybody wants to move freely and become active with their family members on a beautiful hot blue sunny day. Ċ In conclusion, a bright sunny day brings the best psychological sides of humans, while freezing haze produces healthy food and it is, thus, I choose hot weather to cold."
11044,"Many people believe that exploiting animals by humans unethical. However, another group of people think that to satisfy needs such as food & research is acceptable Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion","Since the inception of life on earth, human beings have been utilizing animals to meet their requirements and this has been a controversial topic. Whilst some opine that it is immoral to do so, I would completely agree with those who deem that this approach is acceptable. This essay will discuss both sides, and explain my belief that it is completely justifiable to use animals. Ċ On one side, it is injustice to animals as their life is considered to be of less importance over human. In contrast, in many religions such as Hindu, and Buddhism animals are considered to be God because they are not things instead beings who can feel, touch and see. To exemplify, they can feel pain when medical experiments are conducted on them unsuccessfully and eventually could die of life-threatening diseases. Risking non-human life to benefit from it should not be permissible. Ċ Nevertheless, it is vital to deploy animals for human requirements of lab experiments and food resources. People could die early from illness, if animals were not used in scientific experiments to find the effective cures as there are no alternatives. Moreover, some animal products, for instance, milk does not harm animals, but are crucial for survival of human civilization. Consequently, it is imperative to depend on animals for health and diet reasons otherwise individuals would suffer and starve so it is worth the price paid. Ċ In conclusion, even though some think animals should not be eaten or used by researchers and considered equal to mankind, I completely concur with those who believe that animals are quintessential to satiate numerous societal needs. However, it should be permissible as long as animals are not tortured for entertainment and in unavoidable circumstances."
11045,Topic: Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons. Ċ The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry. Ċ In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts. Ċ Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature. Ċ To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work."
11046,"Courses and general online study have recently become very popular. However, some people still prefer to attend classes in person. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","These days, a large number of people prefer to attend classes online rather than physically. However, there are still certain individuals who think that it is always better to take classes in person. I strongly believe that classes taken on the internet can bring numerous benefits to the masses. This essay will light shed on both sides and outline my view. Ċ On the one hand, it is irrefutable that online classes are inexpensive and convenient which one can take any time or from anywhere in the world. Also, these classes are recorded and one can repeat those lectures infinite times without any hassle. Besides, people can share content with their relatives, friends, and colleagues. This way poor and rich students can get education easily. For example, a recent survey conducted by the New York Times, that reveals, the number of students has increased drastically in Virtual University which offers all the courses online to students. By contrast, it is very much likely that students might get stuck at some point where they need technical assistance which only can be provided by a teacher. Ċ On the other hand, in this modern era, it has become difficult for students to attend traditional classes due to many factors. First and foremost, schooling costs are increased dramatically in schools, colleges, and universities. This is because of the education demand and expenses at these institutes. Secondly, conventional classes are on fixed times. Thus, it is compulsory for students to attend classes on a pre-defined timetable. Last but not least, pupils have to leave their hometown and settle in other countries or cities to get higher education. As a result, they started living in hostels. For instance, according to the education department in Pakistan, academic institutes charge huge fees for accommodation. Ċ To conclude and present my opinion, technology has a great influence on society. Therefore, an increasing number of people are fascinated by online education. This is because it invites lots of advantages to individuals. Whereas the traditional method is too expensive and inconvenient."
11047,"Some people feel that boarding schools (where students or pupils live at school during the term) are an excellent option for children, while other people disagree for a number of reasons. Consider both sides of this debate and reach a conclusion. benefit from staying at school","Some people argued that children will benefit from staying at school, especially in today's fast-changing world. However, the issue is not entirely genuine and other arguments can also be made against the idea. This essay will elaborate both sides of the opinion and provide a conclusion. Ċ Those who supported the boarding school mention various advantages can bring to students. These range from building independent skills to learning how to discipline themselves. For example, children will form surviving skill by living far away from their home, and not depend on their parents. In addition, if children lived closely with their teachers, it would form the intensive relationship between them. Ċ Another argument is students who stay in school during the term led to several drawbacks. The example can be seen in major cities, where the cost of boarding school may be prohibitive. In addition, living with family, children will form family closeness between children and parents. For example, the parents able to see and control their children after school, and communicate more with them. Finally, it must be said that not all young people want to go to boarding school, because they have their own preferences, and if we forced them, it would be negative for their future because of learning without passion. For these children, boarding school should not be the suitable option. Ċ In conclusion, it seems advisable that the decision to enroll our children in boarding school should be based on both children and parents preferences only. It would appear that boarding school will lead to several benefits in terms of independent skill yet it not the only one solution for all parents."
11048,TOEFL: A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.,"I think that must be a little of the two things in balance, an ability for the teacher to relate well with students and good knowledge of the subject being taught. Ċ The teacher's ability to relate well with students can be useful when it focus on the course. And in both sides -teacher-student- must be some special qualities: teacher must be prepared in major of his topics and students must be eager, interested and responsible on classes. Then the relationship between a prepared teacher and an interested student can improve the dynamic of learning. Also if the student is participatory and have previous knowledge on class, he will be able to enrich the lectures or discussion, and encourage the teacher for going on. In this manner will probably exist empathy towards the course. Ċ However, this relationship can't always set and delve whereas for the teacher is a job and an obligation for the student, both working around the school interest. And as the matter of fact, exist an analogy of this relationship in game theory called ecology of the classroom, where a mathematical model of competition or predator-prey can be implemented in this dynamic. It should be mentioned that the teacher needs not only have an excellent knowledge of the subject being taught but also this knowledge must be part of their life, that leads to inspired curiosity and interest when attack the class problems. Ċ In conclusion we can say that both qualities (relate well with students and a good knowledge of the subject being taught) of the teacher are necessary insofar that exist respect, interest and balance from students and all focus on the subject to teach."
11049,Some high school leavers think that they should work or travel for a period of time instead of entering university. To what extent do you agree or disagree with that. Write at least 250 words. Gap year for high school graduates,"It is naturally observed that some high school graduates think they should spend a certain amount of time working or traveling before going straight to the university. In reality, there is a greater liking for a gap time among students who intend it for multiple purposes. However, from my perspective, this route serves its both advantages and disadvantages. Ċ On the one hand, working and traveling would give the students a great opportunity to gain invaluable experience. First, they can mount some campaigns and raise funds to financially support the livings of the poor and elderly. Second, young adults will not only run into many kinds of people but also enlarge our relationship networks. And therefore, I personally believe this can be the deciding factor in equiping seniors with essential skills to manage people in our future career. Last, they are more likely to secure a decent job and help strengthen our community. Ċ On the other hand, not everyone thinks traveling from one place to another for a while suits them. As a matter of fact, some can not afford, for example, the plane tickets, food and accommodation while others are scared of taking risks. Many high school leavers may consider working in gap time simply as a means of earning money more quickly but that makes them less competitive compared with their peers. Consequently, it might be easier for them fall behind of the game when they apply for a position in the future. Ċ In conclusion, taking a gap year between high school and university for work or travel will be of immediate benefit providing that would-be undergraduates may accumulate experience and learn more about themselves to be certain of what next step would be towards the future success."
11050,"high number of rare or endangered species many species of animals and plants are in danger of becoming extinct. what are the causes of this problem, and what can be done to prevent it from happening?","It is true that numerous plants and animals are becoming rare or endangered progressively with the pace of human society's growth and development. The disappearance of flora and fauna is alarming which results in imbalanced ecosystem. Once this system is disrupted it leads to disorder in the ecological food chain that effects every living creatures in it. For example, vultures are the scavengers that helps in maintaining hygiene of the wild life by consuming the dead bodies, which, otherwise would be infested by deadly bacteria, further leading to disease in other wild animals possibly. Ċ In order to find some effective solution to this serious issue, identification of the causes is necessary. To point out, there are three main reasons. Firstly, deforestation in the name of settlement expansion or trade of timbers that leads to destruction of animal and plant life. Secondly, trade of animal skin or rare plants that have medicinal value. Lastly, marine activities like over fishing. Ċ Needless to say that extinction of animal or plant species have adverse effect in the ecological order, possible measures needs to be taken to prevent or protect the endangered species. In regards to deforestation, council or state authorities should monitor this and punish if there is any fraudulent involvement of timber business. Considering the illegal trade of animal parts like leather boots, purse, and belts should be strictly prohibited from entering into the fashion industry. Other way of dealing with the issue also could be not using such materials. As far as marine activities are concerned, strict legal fishing limit should be maintained which then should be strictly monitored. Ċ Considering the causes of the problem, if the suggestion possible remedies are implemented than, world can be a better place to live with well-maintained ecology. As a result, this world will be like heaven with presence of varieties of flora and fauna."
11051,Some people think that family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people Ċ think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your opinion. Ċ You should write at least 250 words.,"A number of people advocate that family has the most profound impact on adolescents. Others, however, claim the opposite, stating that friends outdo family members in this contribution. From my perspective, I voice approval of the latter, in that I believe peers play an indispensable role throughout one's stage of maturity. Ċ In the first place, it is undeniable that fellows generally come in closer contact with the young than do their parents or siblings. In other words, by spending most of their day at school, teenagers embrace the opportunities to get along with their schoolmates, thus fostering mutual trust and intimacy among them over time. Hence, their personality shapes under the influence of their friends, at the same time reflects whether or not it is a healthy friendship. For instance, a large number of juvenile delinquents are talked into committing crimes or taking drugs by bad companies, while the morally good ones flourish by gaining huge benefits from peer support and guidance. Ċ What is more, there exist many other reasons for the close bond between young adults and their companions on a variety of grounds. That is, those in the same age bracket tend to develop a sense of empathy when it comes to sharing or seeking advice from each other, which would not be the same for the relationship between adolescents and parents, which is sometimes hindered by the generation gap. Take, for example, the case for many teen Facebook users is that they are inclined to befriend their companions, while on the other hand ban their parents from following them. This could be hazardous at times as teenagers would easily go out of control. Ċ All things considered, fellows have proved their worth in having a significant influence on one's growth, be it mental or physical. Therefore, I am supportive of the latter, consequently placing emphasis on having trustworthy and true friends."
11052,"Over-reliance on modern technology means that people are failing to learn, or are forgetting many basic skills. To what extent this is true? Are people becoming so reliant on modern technology that they are no longer able to do some things without it?","In the modern era, most people cannot get rid of technology. This brings effects to several inhabitants who they fail in the basic skills since they feel be easy with sophisticated device. While, this is true, I strongly believe that the technology can improve the skills of people. Yet, all depend on their personality. Ċ Technology is more likely to intervene in humans' problems. In this case, they feel comfortable if they can correlate to. Yet, this can lessen the capability of people who still in the first studying. As example, juveniles who still in processing to study mathematic, and they use calculator for helping them solve the math questions. This is a severe action because actually citizens cannot blame the calculator as the main issue formation of fundamental skills. In order to, the superintendence of elderly people is vital. Ċ Nevertheless, individuals use technology for solving their assignments. This is caused they state that technology has been a part of their necessity. But, in fact this statement is reverse. A recent study by Stanford University illustrates that average human being always check their smartphone every 6 minutes and they prefer to access it than sleep. This affects to the time for studying which they tend to be more focus on their entertainment. They should be able to separate the time between learning and playing. Ċ The aforementioned evidence reveals that technology has spread in all aspects even in the education. On the other hand, I reckon this is not threaten to the elementary skills. Indeed, they can improve their abilities and insight with sophisticated devices."
11053,"IELTS Writing task 2: ""Nowadays travelling aborad is more convenient and cheap than ever. Do you think this is a good or bad development?","In the past there were no so many opportunities for our ancestors to see foreign countries, because at first, it costed a lot of mayne and at second it was very hard , for instance, for health, to travel around the world. But these days it has became more convenient. To my mind this aspect has both good and bad sides. Ċ Firstly, I'd mention that person may get more versatile by travelling around the world. He learns new language, he makes acquaintances with new people , he sees a lot of monuments of culture - all of these make him become more erudite and smart. Furthermore, some countries have curative beaches or very good clinics, so that if you can't be given good healing in your country, it wouldn't cost for you much many to go abroad (but of course healing itself may be very pricy). Ċ But there are also bad effects of it on our society. For example, some rich people let their children go abroad and do there anyhing they want. There can be some very bad consequences , and the one I'd like to highlight is high possibility of joining bad company and taking bad experience from it. Because of this reason young folk may get worse and then after coming back to homeland , it may teach to other youngs bad ways of behaving. Ċ To sum up, I reckon that travelling aborad is very useful for people , trying to get more versatile and smart, besides there is a high likelihood of taking bad experience and bringing it back to fatherland"
11054,Some people think that schools do not do enough to teach young people about how to look after their health. To what extent do you agree or disagree,"People are considered to think that during studying at a school pupils do not get enough information on how to take care of their health. In my view, it seems to be false, because there are schools where well-qualified teachers learn looking after the health as well as solving mathematical problems. In addition, school education consists of various subjects which help to understand how a human being's organism is working. Ċ As soon as teachers are improving their pedagogical qualifications, they will study how to cope with basic life issues including being healthy. At first, the teacher is not only a person who teaches defined the subject. Actually, the teacher is the second parent who brings up pupils and educates them. For this reason, many modern schools oblige employees to take some courses which are about treating common diseases, for instance, treat sore throat. Ċ Furthermore, knowledge about processes in a human's body leads to realizing how to be healthy. Consequently, biology is an important subject that allows students to be aware of how to preserve different diseases. For example, biology explains why it is significant to sleep about eight hours every day because our brain recovers energy at night due to the hormone melatonin. Thus, during biology classes, young people can understand how to be healthy. Ċ To summarize, teachers, who finished additional courses, provide pupils with all the necessary information about a healthy lifestyle. Lastly, school education includes biology that learn students how to protect their organisms from different viruses and diseases."
11055,"As a result of growth in some urban centres, the environment in those cities is deteriorating. Ċ How could this issue be tackled by both the government and individuals?","Environmental damage has become a serious issue for the whole world. Many people present the view that as every person gets impacted by it, and thus, the government should tackle this. However, some believe that individuals should take up this responsibility. Ċ To commence with, the government needs to deal with the issue of environment because only it can establish the plants for the renewable and clean energy sources. These plants will help in reducing the consumption of fossil fuels, which release harmful gases as by-products, when used. For example, the ministry of Gujrat, India, have planted multiple windmills for production of electricity, which reduces the use of fuels such as coal. This initiative has decreased the rate of degradation of the environment there. Furthermore, the administration needs to encourage and spread awareness among people, about the use of such energy sources. Ċ On the other hand, people must own up the responsibility of taking measures, because they are the actual entities who can take actions. It is the people who must abide by the laws for the protection of the habitat. For instance, every nation in this world has the law of keeping a check on the emissions from the vehicles. But, if the individual does not act accordingly, then it is harming the habitat. Moreover, small contributions from the individuals such as: using the reusable cloth bags instead of plastic bags etc., can prove to be very helpful. Ċ To conclude, both the administration and individuals need to tackle this problem together. The government must make laws and provide with the equipment to protect the environment, and people must abide by these laws and try to use cleaner energy."
11056,"When talking about success, we often think of people who are rich or famous. Ċ In your opinion, what are the qualities that characterize a successful person? Why do you think these should be the criteria? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Some people think that success is related to either high-income people or public figures. From my perspective, I believe that self-discipline and level of education are the primary values to anyone who wants to be a successful person. This is because those qualities are the key to grab the attention of your clients and build trust with them. Ċ To begin with, I am an ardent supporter of the idea of self-commitment in order to elevate your business. The primary reason is that this trait is an indication to many customers that the company is willing to fulfil their future obligations. Extra stores, for instance, is an excellent example of after-sales customer care for most of their products, which resulted in increasing the sales volume. Another worth-mention point is that higher level of study of those businessmen. This is because not only tertiary schooling is reflecting the way of thinking, but also it is broadening the knowledge of the business stakeholders. Ċ Consequently, the personality values mentioned above will increase the market share dramatically. The reason is that many clients are attracted to those qualities, which indeed increases the sales force. Another contributing point to mention is that people with this such qualities will build long relations with their clients, and by the time, this will build confidence between both parties. Microsoft group, for example, is built by the world-richest man, Bill Gates, who has the most significant shares in this company, and thanks to his personality, the company becomes of the leading influences in the IT field. Ċ In conclusion, I hold the notion that the quality of education along with keeping promises, what makes people successful. This will lead to strengthening the relationship and build confidence with clients and companies."
11057,"Some believe that the Olympic games help bring people from different nations together, while others claim that holding the Olympics wastes money which could be used for important issues. Ċ Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.","In recent days, the public has had various different views about the importance of the Olympic games event held annually by certain countries. Some groups of people think that the Olympic games are a means of bringing peace for many nations, while some others think that it is merely a wasting activity, and there are still many parts of human life that should be improved. The following paragraph will discuss both views, and convey my personal thought which I think money should be spent on other sectors, not on holding the event. Ċ On the one hand, for some individuals, there are some reasons why the Olympic Games could bring peace among nations in the world. Firstly, the Olympic Games are a vast affair participated by most of the countries in the world. This occasion gives space to the fella states to meet and commence communication. Secondly, this situation has been believed to provide numerous opportunities for each nation to meet and talk. For instance, prior to the games or the competitions started by the host country, all athletics are gathered in a hall to have dinner together. This moment is normally used by them to talk and have some communication to understand one another among participants. Therefore, it is believed it could unite different regions. Ċ However, other groups of populations think that this event is considered wasting money, whereas other parts of life should be put as a priority. The main reason behind this is that frequently there are still countries that participate in the competition, are still categorised as poor states. The worse condition is when a country should be hosting the affair. For example, according to a report, reported by BBC News 2020, Indonesia spent 40% of the annual income which is from the taxation allocated to succeed the event, whereas, a number of regions in Indonesia are still suffering from hunger. Thus, this affair does not bring benefit to the local people, yet this leads to poorer conditions. Ċ In conclusion, while several people argue that Olympic games are deemed beneficial which could bring distinct nations together, others believe that this is merely wasting numerous amounts of money. Both sides have their own opinions. I personally agree with the latter argument that this is merely wasting of funds."
11058,Many people believe that film is a less important art than other forms such as literature and painting. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Movies are considered less significant as compared to other types of arts like literature and painting. I totally condemn the idea of giving less importance to films. In further, I will explain the cause of disagreement with the above statement and why movies should be given more attention. Ċ I firmly believe that there are many skills that are involved in making films. However, there are some people that still consider it of less value. Writing a good script is an art that contributes to the making of a movie. Moreover ,there are many artist that put their role in filmmaking. These all contributions of arts and artists result in a superhit film that we enjoy watching in the cinemas. For example, in many Hollywood picture nowadays there is the animation that portraits the whole scenes of a motion picture in a beautiful manner that they made the unreal and imaginative into a real image. These artists are visual painters that bring imaginations into moving virtual images. Ċ The film gives better entertainment in less time as compared to the composition, painting and other arts. Moreover, they are a good source of time passing, that can be watched anywhere and at any time. There are many institutes and universities that provide degrees in filmmaking. For instance, the first filmmaking institute started in 1919 in Moscow, after which it became a significant art that has been taught worldwide. It brings me to my point that with changing demands and interests of people the films and movies are getting more attention. Ċ All in all, the film was considered as of less value as compared to other arts like literature and painting by many people. Whereas, I totally condemn this idea, as I consider the movie as of more consequence in nowadays than any other form of art, because the picture itself is the combination of arts like literature, songs, acting, animation and much more."
11059,"Important truths begin as outrageous, or at least uncomfortable, attacks upon the accepted wisdom of the time. the painful truth","As a human being, we have a tendency to avoid truth because most of the time truth is appalling and it has a history attacking the accepted wisdom. Truth as it seems so simple but it has a deep and convoluted meaning hidden in it. Truth is never mollifying, it always causes a deep turmoil in an individual. As time passes, an individual unravels more about truth and it gets acerbic with time. Ċ To illustrate let us look at an example, there are many famous theories on the existence of nasal lines. These are the lines which can only be seen from universe and it was made 2000 years ago. There is this one famous theory which claims that these lines was developed by aliens so that they can see these lines from universe and land there. As we go deep in these theories we will unravel bit by bit small truth about these line and which is outrageous and not comforting. Ċ As a human being, we have a predilection to not hear acerbic truth, because it make us uncomfortable. We try to escape from the truth and when we confront them in future it is pretty obvious we will be outrageous. Ċ In addition, important truth is not always outrageous and attacks upon the accepted wisdom. Sometime, they support the experience and make us feel good about the truth. Ċ In conclusion, most of the time truth is caustic and unpleasant to hear, but it is important, for our development, to have better understanding of right conscience of right and wrong. Escaping from truth is inevitable and one should not avoid truth just for his comfort, no matter how much uncomfortable truth is one must accept it."
11060,Countries should restrict foreign companies from opening offices and factories in order to protect local businesses. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons and specific examples to explain your answer,"It is argued that to protect domestic businesses, countries should limit the number of multinational companies. However, I completely disagree with this point of view. Ċ On the one hand, there are some reasons why foreign companies should be encouraged to open their branches in other nations. The first reason is the technological advantage. To put it another way, foreign companies will bring high technology to the host countries which saves time for local companies to own it and leads to increased productivity. As an illustration, some Japanese firms which have a reputation for state-of-the-art technological innovations in the world are regularly invited to Viet Nam to build their new branches, which improve the quality of production. The second reason is having more opportunities to deal with international partners. In other words, developing countries have a chance to export their local productions to a wide range of industrialized corporations. As a result, local manufactures might enjoy supercharged economic growth. Ċ On the other hand, the local economy might benefit from receiving foreign investment in many ways. Firstly, when foreign companies open their branches and offices in a country, they help generate several jobs. This gives a boost to the local economy. For example, the Samsung corporation provides jobs for 10000 people in Vietnam in 2017, reported by a VNexpress. Secondly, the competition in the local market will be increased by the arrival of new companies. This will lead to the fact that the local companies have to price their products competitively. Furthermore, the tough competition will make the quality of products and services improved. Thus, foreign investment will bring benefits for not only the country but also the consumers. Ċ In conclusion, for the reasons I have mentioned above, I strongly believe that encouraging foreign companies will bring many benefits to the host countries such as receiving modern technologies, having potential dealers, creating more jobs, and improving the quality of products and services as well."
11061,Some people advocate death penalty for those who committed violent crimes. Others say that capital punishment is unacceptable in contemporary society. Ċ Describe advantages and disadvantages of death penalty and give your opinion.,"Many people believe that the death penalty is necessary to keep the security system efficient in the society. While there are some negative aspects of capitalism retribution, I agree with the view that without it we will become more vulnerable to violence. Ċ Death penalties can be considered unsuitable discipline for several reasons. The strongest argument is that we have no rights to kill other humans. Right to live is the basic right of any human being, and no one can infringe this right, irrespective of the person’s deeds. Moreover, innocent people can face wrongful execution. Such unfair sentences take away the lives of innocent people and make other citizens lose faith in law and justice. And besides, sometimes criminals repent of their acts. In this case they should be given a second chance to improve themselves. Ċ However, I believe that capital forfeiture is necessary in the society. Firstly, it is an effective deterrent of major crimes. The best method to prevent a person from committing crime is to show the consequences of his or her actions. For example, the government of Pakistan has controlled the rate of terrorism by enforcing death penalties for the members of terrorist organisations. Secondly, the governments spend large sums of national budget on maintenance of prisoners. Instead, this money can be used for the development of the society and welfare of the people. Ċ To conclude, although capital retribution has some disadvantages, I think that it proves to be the best way of controlling criminals, lessening governmental expenses and preventing other people from doing crimes."
11062,You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Modern communications mean that it’s no longer necessary to write papers. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 250 words.,"How much it was annoying to wait for letters for months until they arrived at their destinations? It is the perfect time to end this era. Technology helped humanity to build a communication bridge between all countries where services are instant, efficient and time-reducing. Therefore, I strongly believe that new communications are more significant than pieces of paper because they are productive and eco friendly. Ċ First of all, recent methods to communicate proved their ability to manage time and increase the exchanges between several communities. In fact, we can write a message for our foreign relatives , our employers and our favourite shop in a few seconds, and it delivers quickly without any restrictions. Time and money are the most important elements in the business where international companies aim to use emails, online conferences and social advertisements as very powerful weapons in the market in order to develop their profits. For instance, Zoom and Outlook are considered to be the top internet platforms where persons can interact and access easily with their interests. Ċ Secondly, protecting the environment is a global concern for governments and organizations all around the world. We all know that writing on paper will cost our nature many of its resources and raw materials such as wood, leaves, plastic and even animals. A simple electronic mail will be sent using only a small current of electricity that is already supplying the machine like a mobile phone or a computer. Another issue will be in the ink in pens which it fabricating process usually is destructive for the other living species. Ċ To conclude, it is vital in recent times to use modern communication tools in order to facilitate our social. I hope we will suspect more development and features in this domain because it was very helpful in the last decades."
11063,"It is commonly believed that nowadays main factors that affect a child's development are media, pop culture and friends. A different point of view is that family plays the most significant role. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is generally argued by some that external factors have several significant impacts on a child’s development; diametrically opposed to this, others propound the idea that the dedicated upbringing of parents plays an important role in children progression. Although both sides may advance equally compelling arguments in support of themselves, I personally incline towards the latter for the rationale that follows. Ċ On the one hand, it is a fact beyond dispute that there are a number of reasons why most of the child’s development is affected by technologies and their peers in the modern era. To begin with, the children are likely to copy the behaviour and catchphrases of their favourite personalities. For instance, more increasing of violent display and colloquial advertising is showed by the uncontrolled proliferation of media platforms, which negatively affects children progression. In addition, the young generation’s can be easily influenced by the digital world, trending fashion and peers. Because of the fast-paced technological innovation, children these days spend their time on the screen. Therefore, the young tend to immerse in different international cultures by the sharing of internet users and friends. Ċ On the other hand, there is no gainsaying that the training of parents is most significant to the development of the young age. The first point is that only parents can teach the children how to talk and behave toward others in accordance with the moral code. A further explanation worth mentioning is that parents are great friends for the pupil. Taking the typical example is that mom and dad can spend their spare time playing video games, do some outdoor activities or brainstorming ideas for homework at school after taking the school hours, which are extremely contributed to foster the family bonding. Ċ To conclude then, whilst there exist contrasting stances on the matter, it is taxing work to determine which may be more positive. Howbeit, in line with the previous discussion, I am convinced to assert that the parents’ guidance is a vital role in the successful development of the pupil."
11064,"Writing, reading and maths are the three recognized traditional subjects. Computer skill should also be the fourth largest branch. Do you agree or disagree?","It is often argued that numbers, composition and assignment stand the pick up on trios of ancestral dependents. Computer mastery should similarly stand behind it in the sector. I tend to agree with this belief. I believe that because of the abilities of the device must be the next conventional content. Ideas articulated further in this discourse will support my stand and at the same time highlight certain contradictory views that others in this society might give birth to. Ċ Firstly, in this contemporary globe utmost of the individuals work depended on the computer because it is very convenient and straight. therefore, the dexterity of this device is very essential which may helpful for surviving in a faster-growing world. for instance, currently in the covid-19 pandemic, every individual must have done their work from home and it becomes possible because of this machine. Ċ On the other hand, there are selves in the society who are of the outlook that it can move toward to be an addiction for the amateurs and they claims that there are many detriments of this apparatus. if it pleases a productive subject then excessive use of it can lead to misdirection. for specimen, if an offspring reads up illicit activity like hacking hence it serves formidable for him, their parents and others. Ċ To conclude, that surely are those in the society who seem to be convinced with the fact that this machine is hazardous and they assumingly have all the right reasons to back their conviction. I, however, am of the firm opinion that computer has to be most precious subject and nowadays it is very essential for people."
11065,Some people say that staying in a hotel in a foreign country when on holiday is not the best way to get to know about the country and its people. Do you agree or disagree?,"To some, staying at hotels when holidaying abroad is not the method to comprehend a nation and the people living in it. From my point of view, I consider myself in agreement with the statement. Ċ For a variety of reasons, it would be wrong to reckon that having an oversea holiday to learn about a country and its people is the best method. One of the main reasons is that hotels always offer tourists good and luxury services to confine them within the hotel zone to enjoy those services. It leads to the notion that quite a few tourists frequently be too lazy to discover the nation they are traveling just because of spending time on the services of the hotels. To make sense of that, for instance, quite a few hotels provide luxury meals and playing rooms to tourists so that they may take a whole day within the hotel zone. Ċ Another reason is that doing so causes tourists to fail to obtain the knowledge they want in an oversea country. Therefore, people cannot realize the local culture or even what happens outside the zone of the hotels when they are in that zone. Quite a few harmful impacts may place pressure on local tourism because of transferring the wrong information about the country by tourists. To several tourists, sharing wrongly the knowledge they know is frequently happen, because sometimes they do not realize the knowledge they obtained is the case or not. Ċ To conclude, my point is that if tourists want to comprehend more about a foreign country's culture and people, just go out of the comfortable zone and experience more so that they can know whatever they want.

11066,"Health care should not be provided for free regardless of a person’s income. The health of a person is in their own hands and they should, therefore, be held accountable for that. Ċ Do you agree with this statement?","Medical facilities to a person should not be provided for free irrespective of his financial status. The well-being of a person is in his own hands, so they should be taking care of themselves, entirely. However, I strongly disagree with this notion and believe that the audience living below the poverty line and government employees should be given free medical care. Ċ To begin with, the first and foremost reason to support my viewpoint is that the majority of the people in developing countries lie below the poverty line due to which they can not avail themselves of medications. The reason for this is they usually are uneducated and work on low wage jobs, as a result, they are unable to provide a nutritive diet and medical facilities to their family members. For instance, according to a survey by 'The Times', 30% of children in developing areas of Mumbai suffer from malnutrition as their parents have no money to feed them, therefore in that situation only government can provide a helping hand. Ċ Secondly, my opinion is further bolstered by the factor that the good health of working employees defines the growth of the nation as employment sectors are largely responsible for proliferating the economy of the country. In this modern and hectic lifestyle, individuals are working relentlessly in various sectors such as education, health, agriculture and information technology, as a consequence, the productivity of these areas leads to the development of the nation. Henceforth, to produce a healthy workforce for the betterment of the country it is important for the governing authorities to provide healthcare facilities. The free medical coverage for the native people of the USA serves as the best example of this approach. Ċ In conclusion, while everyone is responsible for keeping themselves fit, in my perspective, the provision of medical subsidies by the government is vital not only for the financially poor community but also for the working professionals to uplift the economy of the country."
11067,Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Others believe that students should spend their whole day on academic studies. Discuss both the views and state your opinion?,"The significance of exercises as part of the school curriculum has been a debatable issue. Some folks argue that school students should enrol in physical exercises while others say that they should focus on their grades. This essay will delve into both these arguments before reaching an opinion. Ċ To begin with, sports activities at a young age can have many long term benefits like height, weight and good body shape. This has been a noticeable fact that the children involved in games have good physical health and are more confident. Moreover, participation in games can boost their memory and concentration. Therefore, this will automatically enhance their academic performance.Further, sporting also teaches team values and punctuality. Additionally, there is a good career opportunity in athletics these days. For instance, famous cricketers like MS Dhoni is among the most famous men. Ċ On the other hand, a group of people say that kids should give their 100% to academics so that they can have a good job in future. Academic excellence is required for a lucrative job. For example, a person should have good marks in order to have a white colour job like doctor, teacher or engineer. Researchers state that students not getting enough time for their studies and have so much mental stress. Ċ In the conclusion, Although studies are important, sports should not be overlooked. In my opinion, Physical activities are very essential to avoid health issues, improve mental strength. It builds a good personality by embedding leadership, team spirit and honesty."
11068,"Topic: Topic: In some countries, the population is a mix of people from different cultures and ethich groups. Why is this case ? Discuss benefits and disadvantages of this issue ?","In some countries like American or Britain, the population is a combination of people from all walks of life with different cultural background.Some people belive that this is conducive to muti-cultural societies while others claim that more pains than gains behind this issue. My essay will shed light on reasons,pros and cons of this issues. Ċ One of the first contributors to this issue is that in order to secure job opportunities with high-paid salaries, people from poor countries tend to move to developed countries.Another reason is that Only by living in industrial nations can people receive better health care and education.That's why there is an increasing number of asian students seeking sholarships to pursue their passion at American universities.Finally,Countries having a stable economy and politic attract wokers and professionals who desire to avoid polictical conflicts. Ċ Advantages and disadvantages are noticeable. On one hand, living in different parts of the world enables people to expand their knowledge ceaselessly, deriving from learing different cultures and customs.As a result, mutural understanding can be nurtured. Equally important, No sooner have students from impoverished nations studied at high quality universities in developed ones than they are able to shake off poverty, climb the social lader and secure employment.Moreover, thanks to working with foreign experts for years, local people can learn good quintessence from punctuality, seriouness to pressure dealing.Howerver,owing to cultral shock,foreign studetns may feel isolated and depressed, causing their poor academic performance.Futhermore, without parental control, they can be lured into social evils. Another drawback is that To maximize their economic edge, bussinessmen who come to developed countries may pour a huge amount of money into the construction of industrial zones poor countries, which darkens the sky and results in healthy problems. Ċ In conclusion,there are pros and cons in living a country where people come from different culutures.I strongly believe that people should take actions to hamonize with others."
11069,"Nowadays, many people have to work longer time and they feel more stressful than before. What are the reasons? What can employers do to make their life easier?","In this modern era, stress is a big problem today.While some stress is a normal part of the organisation, excessive tension can decrease the efficiency of the employee and can reduce their mental and physical health.This essay will discuss the reasons why this is happening and put forward several solutions for this issue. Ċ There are many causes of pressure in the workplace.Firstly, employers wants more work, so they give unrealistic deadlines to the company person to complete the projects.In Delhi, for example, in the year 2018 as per Time newspaper survey, the tension level has been drastically increased as compared to previous years.Moreover, lack of proper training and poor working relationship with the management is also one of the reasons.The Employee may feel bullied or harassed, if he is not given work as per his experience.For instance, in most of the startup companies of the world, no formal training is given to the employees because of limited budget of the company.Due to cut throat competition, employers are considered about their own work only and they do not care about the health of the employees Ċ While the problems may seem intractable, there are solutions available.Firstly, Employers can take steps to cope with the office stress.They should diagnose what is causing strain, as it would definitely affect their business directly.From time to time, they should monitor the workload.If overwork is causing tension in the business, then they should try to reduce people's workload.They should ensure their targets are challenging, but realistic.In addition to it, weekly games in the office, proper holiday entitlement and small perks fro the employer would definitely make the bond stronger among them.For example, if any, of the employee is sick, it is the responsibility of the management to get in touch.They should take a sympathetic approach towards their staff member. Ċ In conclusion, while the issues are evidently clear, there are measures that can be taken to alleviate them.Stress in the organisation is an issue of great concern.The Employer should check workload among his staff regularly and should take necessary action, as it can reduce the efficiency of the staff which is ultimately detrimental to the company."
11070,in some cultures children are taught by their parents that they can achieve anything with hard work Ċ what are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend,"Parents, nowadays, are preaching their children to task hard and are also making them believe that everything can be gained in this way. While it is important to make children aware of the indispensable nature of hard effort in realising one's goals, laying over emphasis on it can have dangerous side effects. This essay will both advantages and disadvantages of this trend. Ċ As far as advantages are concerned, there is a myriad of these. Firstly, teaching children to task hard makes them more successful in life. To put it differently, there is no denying to the fact that being industrious, always pays and by making children to acknowledge the fact that being laborious is an inevitable step in the path of success parents are increasing their chances of becoming successful in life. For instance, people who learn the importance of the struggle, become greater leaders and entrepreneurs. Moreover, laying more stress on hard work also improves the personality of a person. To explain further, a person who himself is diligent, is always respectful of the efforts of others. Thus, making him humble and considerate of others. Ċ However, there are also a few disadvantages of this trend. The main disadvantage of this practice is its deceptive nature. This is to say, even though the struggle is the key to success, it is not the only thing which leads to victory. To explain, sometime other factors like luck and circumstances overpower all efforts. Hence, shattering the hopes of a person. For an illustration, a child may effort hard whole year to secure first rank in the annual exam, but may fall ill just a day before the examination, therefore resulting in unexpected failure. Ċ To conclude, although hard work is an essential lesson to be taught to the children by the parents, since it makes them more successful and a better human being, overemphasizing the fact that it can help achieve something is incorrect. Since victory depends upon many other factors too. As a result, the concept of hard endeavour should be introduced wisely to the younger generation, in order to protect them from the potential side effects."
11071,Many people living in cities these days do not get enough physical exercise. Ċ What are the causes of this? Ċ What are the SOLUTIONS?,"Nowadays, a great number of residences of the urban areas are not engaging themselves in physical activities. This essay will discuss the reasons for the inactive lifestyle of city dwellers, such as busy metropolis life and inadequate spaces for doing exercise. Furthermore, this essay will also recommend solutions to the above problems, including reducing the working hour and establishing more fields and physical activities centres. Ċ To begin with, the hectic and stressful life of towns is one of the main causes for showing unwillingness of the citizens of the town for doing work-outs. Since residents of the metropolis have to work under tremendous pressure in their workplace and commute back to the home after facing a bottleneck situation, they do not retain much stamina and energy to participate in physical exercise. Secondly, almost all the metropolitans have fewer numbers of parks and fields. Consequently, the inhabitants do not find adequate areas for jogging, running, and walking. For instance, it is shown in a recent survey that only 4% of the total land area of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, has been used for parks and amusement places. Thus, people of towns are devoid of having sufficient workout opportunities due to strenuous urban life and lack of free locations. Ċ In response to the above scenario, few steps can be taken to solve these problems. First and foremost, the government should take necessary steps to cut down the working time and traffic congestion in order to facilitate the city-dwellers with sufficient free time to maintain an active lifestyle. For example, In Sweden, working hours have been reduced to motivate its inhabitants to maintain a healthy lifestyle and a sound work-life balance. Another solution to these problems can be to build ample capacities and establishment for doing workout and physical exercises. Ċ In conclusion, arduous metropolis life and insufficient place for doing physical exercise are the major causes for the sedentary lifestyle of the urban population. Nevertheless, by lessening the work time and constructing more gymnasium and parks, the government can encourage them to remain physically active and fit."
11072,Some people believe that students should be made to have unpaid jobs in their free time. Do you agree or disagree?,"Due to the increasing prices of all goods, more and more people have started applying for jobs. A large number of the applicants who apply for jobs are students who have recently graduated from high school looking to pay off their student loans. Nonetheless, there are a small majority of individuals who strongly believe that students should not be paid while employed in their jobs. In my opinion, it is wrong to deny a paycheck to students who are working. After analysing the difficulties of students who are working to improve their financial situation as well as those who are looking to gain life skills while working in a job will prove this. Ċ Firstly, most pupils who are working in a job are often looking to make some money. The money they make is mostly used to pay off their student loans or to even help support their family. For instance, a survey conducted by the New York Times in 2017, has stated that 87% of those who are working a job are in need of some money to help pay for their college and this cash can help support them financially. Therefore, it is clear that denying students a paycheck even after working a job is wrong as they are exploited as free labour. Ċ Secondly, most students take up a job because they want to gain some knowledge and life skills. As a result, when companies offer unpaid internships in exchange experience, it seems attractive to these candidates. A study conducted by Singapore's ministry of manpower in 2018, has concluded that unpaid internships often lure applicants and use them as free labour. Furthermore, it is said that pupils can work on something worthwhile like either working on projects or attending seminars on their subjects of interest and gain knowledge in a better way. Hence, it is apparent that a few high school graduates are attracted by unpaid job offers that offer experience but in turn, need free labour. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that unpaid employment offers affect students in a negative way as it not only wastes their time by not providing them with the money they need to pay for their loans but also exploits them as free labour by convincing them they are providing valuable experience."
11073,"Some people think that strict punishment for driving offenses are the key to reduce traffic accidents. Other, however, believe that other measures could be more effective in improving road safety.  Discuss both views and give your own opinion. serious law enforcement for reckless drivers","It is common believe that traffic lawbreakers should be sentenced to severe punishment is preferred solution to answer the high rank of traffic accidents. While other though said that constructing enchanted infrastructures to improve physical safety of road should exceed more positive impacts. I personally believe that bold decision to make proper punishment would be better to overcome this issue. Ċ It is general for highway to be equipped by traffic tools to ensure users are comfort and safe. For instance, it is an obligation for local authority providing sufficient numbers of traffic signs particularly in area where it has more risk to crash to occur. Those would be very helpful for public to be noticed when they are spotted in right place. In contrast, the warnings should cost much expense of budget while it continues to use in future because high numbers of signs do not identically reflect the success of traffic accidents reducing. Ċ On the other hand, user's attitude and behaviour would impact more benefits through serious law enforcement. This kind of measure could be executed by officers to sentence the offenders with equal punishment with no exception from all of groups. Furthermore, it would educate people to understand how essential the law is in daily life where it should accidentally build the sense of law awareness. When the awareness are maintaining, preferable attitude in driving would be being part of habitual tradition. Thus, citizens may contribute to create a harmony to each other and to lead a firm obedience of official rules. Ċ To sum up, traffic rules breaking which causes more accidents should be tackled by firmly practical regulation for those who offend. It is cost-effective and most suitable to vouch the rules would be obeyed by public."
11074,Rich industrialised nations are responsible for global warming so it is their duty to find a remedy. Do you agree?,"There is no doubt that the global warming is currently a burning issue affecting adversely all nations in the world. It is said that the underlying causes of this problem are mainly addressed to the rich industrialized nations whose assumed responsibility is to seek to remedy. However, it leads to a debate of whether this onerous duty should be solely handled by a particular group of country or it is discharged by a whole world. In my perspective, it would probably be every country that must fulfill such fundamental responsibility. Ċ First and foremost, it is inevitable that this global issue results in rapid deterioration due to the industrial countries' excessive reliance on fossil fuels. The emission of carbon dioxide is concerned in the climate change, which is mainly generated from pollution-spewing factories of those nations exploiting fossil fuels as a valuable source. Taking China as an example, in 2008, it accounted for 23.5% of world's CO2 emission, whereby Chinese industry-based economy may not be prevented from consuming fossil fuels. Nevertheless, not only do the rich industrialized countries have to bear the forward consequences, but also other nations will soon face the results Ċ On the other hand, the responsibility should be shared between the countries due to their distinct uses of national resources . There are underdeveloped countries, developing countries and developed countries. Typically, underdeveloped and developing ones are unlikely to afford modern technology and have proper methodologies to create high-quality manufacturing infrastructure, resulting in the over-controlled emission of greenhouse gases affecting the climate. On the contrary, the developed countries or rich industrialized nations are currently using energy substitute to avoid letting the polluting gases into the atmosphere, but the consumption of fossil fuels is still remained. Ċ To sum up, in my view, the world should be in charge of finding a remedy towards this issue rather than solely a group of country bearing this significant duty."
11075,"Our cities are noisier than ever before. Why is this so, and what can be done about it? You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.","Nowadays, it is believed that people live in a noisier environment than in the past. My view is that industrialization and pursuit of night life-style are the main causes. Also, it is the responsibility of both government and enterprise to clear up the problem. Ċ To begin with, due to the fast development of industrialization, a series of infrastructures have been build in order to satisfy resident's demand. In order to complete the projects before deadline, construction companies would prefer to choose continuously operation and apply heavy machines during day and night. Consequently, constantly loud sounds make people believe that their living environment has been damaged. Apart from the construction, chasing night lifestyle is another contribution. Working pressure and interpersonal relationship led individuals to join the night activities such as shopping and clubbing, to release the pressure. Therefore, shop owners would try to extend trade hours to attract more customers. This is why streets are full of people even in the late night. Ċ In terms of solving the problems, government can take the primary role by introducing law and regulation. For example, government could regulate the trade hours for shops and reduce the accessibility of night public transport thereby controlling people stay night outside. Furthermore, construction companies should also take corporate responsibilities by limiting heavy machines operation during the night, and massive fine should be applied if companies break the rules. Ċ To conclude, cities development and chasing night lifestyle are mainly responsible for noise in urban areas. But joint effort by government and enterprise could return a relatively peace environment to community."
11076,There are many people who go to live in different countries. To what extent should people be allowed to move freely between countries and live where they choose? What are the benefits and drawbacks of this?,"Throughout all the times, many citizens ones' state has been migrating in different countries for various reasons. Therefore, the government most popular countries complicated relocation what has provoked outrage among some people who want freely migrate. Nevertheless, countries have not only benefited in immigration, such as fill most unpopular work area via foreigners, but also have a negative impact such as on crime or workplace parts. Ċ On the one hand, people cannot decline the fact what all immigrants are different, thereby they uncontrolled entry can worse situation in the country. Firstly, some perpetrators hide from the judging in other countries, however, there they do not forget their habits, thereby the crime level in such country increase. Likewise, different countries have various laws that complicate arrest and deportation after it. For example, for this reason is created the Interpol organisation that has always been searching such delinquents. Besides, foreigners relocate with different sickness, as a result, they or cannot work, or they help illness spread around the world that leads to ambiguous aftermath such as more spend from the country budgets or a pandemic outbreak. Ċ Although some people bring in the new country positive impact such as the new specialists in any unpopular work area. Since some people change homeland because want to expand their knowledge about their profession, and they can fill area their specialisation if the country there they go have scarcity such specialists. Furthermore, countries always have workplaces with small wages where citizens do not want work, nonetheless foreign, especially from the poor countries, work there willingly; as result, countries keep the balance of labour force via immigrants. Ċ To conclude, the government should strictly control the entry of immigrants for evading trouble in the future, even if they have a strong shortage of labour for an any reason. More importantly, people cannot freely move and live wherever they want due to it has ambiguous influence on the future of the country."
11077,"Nowadays , women as well as men work full time. Therefore, women and men should share household tasks equally. ( eg cleaning and looking after children ).To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In a fast-paced life men and ,women both are busy making their careers. Women are now becoming more prone towards building their careers instead of bounding themselves to household work. In my forthcoming ,essay I will discuss why both genders should be responsible for doing the tasks equally. Ċ Firstly, in modern-day ,life women are now more outgoing than previously. In past days men were allotedCorrect your spellingallowedIf you don’t want alloted to be marked as misspelled in the future, you can add it to your personal dictionary. Ċ to work to go outside and earn money. While ladies were more towards looking at kids and doing household chores at home. In the present-day ,situation it is a necessity for both men and women to work together whether it's outside or inside. Moreover, to strengthen the family economically it's essential for both of them to earn money. For instance, in the U.K. both genders work equally and they both work along by looking at their children at home. Ċ Secondly, there is a huge surge in inflation across the globe. It is too tough for a single parent to give better education and a better life for a large family. To give enough support as well as to alleviate the living standards of their family both genders across the globe performance together. Whether it's sports, music, film business or any other field. Women are doing great jobs and excelling in that area. Likewise, there are many developing countries too like India which has changed drastically in past few years. Furthermore, 70% of women in the total world population are involved in giving their valuable time and earning money. Ċ To conclude, nowadays working outside is not bound by being a woman. Giving privilege to ladies to work outside can not only boost the family growth while it also shows countries development. Thus, in my ,view men and women should definitely divide their tasks equally and endeavour side by side with each other."
11078,"Scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could. Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.","I strongly support the assertion that scandals are useful because they stir up all people in any level of social and education classification. Moreover scandals have some special properties which make them more useful than when a speaker or reformer wants to reveal such a wrong-doing, such as their high-speed spreading, subjects and persons which scandals are about, and the government responsibility about them. Ċ First of all, scandals are spreading between different people as quickly as possible, and nobody can stop them from traveling people to people. They do not need any resources such T.V. or billboard and do not need anyone to support or advocate them. Ċ Moreover, scandals are about famous people who have important role in societies. These types of people usually have many powers and influences so that no body has enough courage and power to reveal their wrong-doings. Scandals are the best way to make them known and destroy their specious character among all society. Ċ On the other hand, scandals usually are about important affairs which are crucial for all people's life. For example consider a senator who has used his power to possess a lot of lands and gardens. Or a bank boss who has paid a lot of loans to his relatives. These affairs are about financial resources which belong to all people and are important for all of them. Ċ Finally, when a scandal discloses a wrong-doing to all people in a community, the government has to deal with it properly. But, I think when a speaker or reformer tries to reveal such a wrong-doing or condemn an important person's action, governments tends to condone them or do not pay enough attention to them."
11079,"""Age discrimination occurs when a decision is made on the basis of a person's age. In the workplace, these are most often decisions about being employed in the first place, winning promotions or being unfairly dismissed. Should discrimination against older workers be made illegal. "" too old for this job or not?","Today, there are more and more age discrimination in the workpace, older workers are treated unfairly in a various ways. There are arguments about whether it is legal to discriminate older workers. As far as I am concerned, the country should set up law to make discrimination against older workers illegal. This essay will discuss about more details. Ċ It is usually true people may get sluggish when getting older. However, whether one is capable for a job depends more on his/her skill set, attitude and ability, rather than simply the one's age. For certain jobs, it is not required to be prompt physically, such as financial accounting and teacher. Ċ More over, older workers make great contribution to their company and are more experienced in their area. Firing older workers just because they are old is not wise. Experience is priceless, it can help the company to work better and can help new comers to grow rapidly. Lastly, age discrimination will cause negative effect on young workers, since they can forecast their unfair treatment in the future, they will lose passion on their job and become less dedicated. Ċ Taking considered measures, it is critial to establish laws to make age discrimination illegal in order to protect older workers, and promote competing fairly in workplace according to one's capability. By doing so it will help the older workers and encourage people to be more engaged in the work he/she is doing."
11080,Some people think that it is better for children to read books and other materials that are educational. Other people think that children should be allowed to read whatever they like. Reading for children,"Books, which are saved knowledge, are very important to people, especially with students. Unfortunately, books aren't always useful, so some people believe that it is more advanced for young people read books and other material that is for training. Other people consider that youngsters should be let's read whatever they like. Ċ In the first view, It is more useful for students to read books and other materials that are for informative academic. Educational books are very good for young people but children need to discover which thing they really like, it is more important than just following an educational system. Studying book always be used in school so actually, young people read them every day. It is the reason make bore for studying. Those reasons can harm youngster's dream, it may destroy young people's future.So read educational books is useful but it is not enough. Ċ In other hand, people understand that children should be permitted to read whatever they want. This way is very good for students but has some negative effects.First of all, the content of some books may not appropriate to the age of youngsters. Secondly, a plot may consist of violent and aggressive scenes. As a consequence, such kind of books can damage children's mind and make them cruel.Those effects may damage youngsters' life.So in this opinion, it is very risky to allowed children read whatever they like. Ċ In my opinion, I believe that young people should read whatsoever their parents allowed. Adults have many experiences about life so they knew which books are useful for their sons and daughters. This way is compiled between allowing and preventing so teenagers can read what they interesting but we sure the books are safed. I think that children will develop completely and strongly by this solution."
11081,"Some people think sports in schools is a waste of time and resources, while other believe it is a vital part of education. Discuss both the view and give your opinion.","It is considered by some that having physical education in an academy is not worth spending time and supplies, while there are others who think it is an essential portion of school curriculums. In my opinion, having exercise lessons in faculty has a very important role in offspring's health. Ċ On the one hand, a certain amount of people believe offspring should spend more time studying, not playing sport. While students are tested for their understanding level of basic subjects, such as math, literature, or science on the exams, the physical movement has less impact, or in some cases no impact at all, on the University entrance exam. They believe that institutions are meant to give their best in education, and if this does not happen, that leads admission and their parents to worry and get frustrated. They may be worried there will be a lack of time for learning math, literature, or science. On top of that, Distributing a budget for physical activity may reduce the amount of money that could have been used for other subjects stuff. Ċ On the other hand, there is a good deal of advantages of playing sport in institutions. To begin with, it is undeniable that physical enterprises are equally important as any other aspect of education. It is a good way to reduce scion's stress and relieve tensions from their bodies. Consequently, the heir is able to focus more on their studies after doing some exercises. According to some research, admission showed more concentration on study after they had some kind of exercise, compared to other children who did not have any moving activities while they are in the learning institutions. Furthermore, if it is a sport that involves team play, it is also a good opportunity to learn to work in a team and problem-solving skills. Ċ In conclusion, while there are some individuals who are concerned about having played in school lessons, I believe that it is essential for children to do some exercises between hours of studying, and it outweighs the drawbacks."
11082,"All over the world, the number of overweight people is growing. What do you feel are the main causes of this? What are the effects?","The obesity rate around the world has increased by a whopping 60% over the decade. Due to the development of ,mankind we are subjected to various changes that directly are the causes of overweight. In this essay, I will be discussing my notes of the causes and their effects. Ċ Firstly, we live in a fast-paced world where people do not have time to cook for themselves. Most people rely on fast foods and ready-made meals. Although they are very convenient, it is certainly not healthy and causes direct health-related issues. For instance, normal human calorie consumption in a day should be around 2100 Kcal on average, whereas, one burger from a KFC is above 1700 calories. Studies show that in the USA there are five times more grab and go restaurants operating in comparison to their population. That shows the number of citizens opting for junk food. I believe this to be one of the main causes of overweight in today's generation. Ċ Secondly, Obesity causes severe health issues. Most people with this problem are immobilized. In addition to this, doctors have also reported heart problems as one of the common observations in obese individuals. As a result, the death rate has certainly increased in youngsters'. For example, a healthy person has a lifespan of 60 years, whereas, on the other hand, an overweighed man might just have half the time. Although, most of them are not considering switching their habits, some are understanding the severity of the situation and seeking help. This can be stated as one of the effects out of many. Ċ To conclude, It is a severe concern to mankind. It is our responsibility to understand and take care of healthy habits. Each and every single human deserves to live a happy and joyful life; however, situations like these are very concerning are need action to be taken immediately. Therefore, I believe educating people about the side effects and possibilities to overcome them may be useful."
11083,Some people propose that smoking should be banned completely. What's your opinion? Give reasons to your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience.  people's attitude toward smoking,"Recently, people's attitude toward smoking has significantly altered. The habit once considered elegant of high-end people is now regarded as a bad habit. I completely side with people who suggest that smoking should be strictly prohibited. Ċ First of all, smoking is proved to have links with lung cancer and other cardiac diseases. WHO has released a report indicating that smokers have noticeable shorter life span than those who do not smoke, approximately up to ten years, as they are more likely to experience fatal illness. Moreover, people who smoke get more chances of giving birth to children with deficiencies. It should also be noticed that not only smoking affects people who smoke, passive smokers, those inhale secondhand smoke suffer as well. It is evident that the rate of non-smokers suffering from smoking-related diseases is even higher than that of smokers. Ċ Secondly, strict prohibition of smoking can save up a large amount of money for the government and related authorities. Many people argue that tobacco industry is one of the key contributors to the national economy, as the taxes imposed on such industry is extremely high. However, the cost that the government has to pay to proceed medical research and to address problems arising from smoking is much greater than those collected. Ċ In conclusion, I advocate the opinion opposing of smoking and convinced that the government should completely ban smoking due to the hazardous consequences it might bring to human's well-being, as well as the fact it would gradually hurt the national economy."
11084,Some people think that the crime among teenagers is increasing because of violent video games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is often argued by some that playing aggressive video games have been causing more offence by young people in modern society. From my point of view, I partly agree with this opinion since apart from brutal plays, other factors could lead to the intense behaviour of young folks. In this essay, I will elaborate more on this in detail. Ċ On the one hand, playing video games that involves intense actions have negative impacts on large numbers of teenagers' behaviours. Firstly, they are easily influenced and get the wrong idea of attacking people and think it is okay to be violent. For example, many young folks imitate the way of violent characters in games as if it is cool. According to some research, people who have seen violent actions for a certain amount of time showed 70% more aggressive actions and facial expressions. Ċ On the other hand, there are other factors involved in the increased rate of juvenile wrongdoing apart from online playings. To illustrate this, some juveniles commit crimes because of some academic problems or conflicts with their parents. Some research shows that the percentage of committing a crime tend to be 60% higher when teenagers are facing some kind of difficulties in life compared to those who have no problems in the academic field or in a family. For instance, there was a male student who attacked an elder citizen in February 2022, and he was suffering from his educational difficulties. Ċ To conclude, although aggressive online activities have a negative impact on great numbers of juveniles, it is not the only reason causing youngsters' crimes. Other factors that are surrounded by them are also undeniable."
11085,"In the 20th century, contact between many different parts of the world has developed apidly through air travel and telecommunications. Ċ Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","These days, in the digital generation where technology is involved in almost every aspect of people's lives, the contact between populations in many sections of the world has rapidly grown through air travel and telecommunications. This movement contains both advantages and disadvantages, therefore, both of them will be discussed in detail in the following paragraphs before the conclusion is reached. Ċ It is undeniable that everything on earth always come with both pros and cons, including the idea that air travel and telecommunications have become extremely noticeable in the public. There are numerous disadvantages that can be noted, but one will be explained in this paragraph. With rapidly developed technology nowadays, society tends to forget how they used to live without them. For instance, after using too much air travel or telecommunications such as telephone or other electronic devices, a person may become too dependent on them and would not be able to do anything or solve their current problems. Ċ However, I believe the positive effects made by air travel and telecommunications actually outweigh the mentioned drawbacks. They make humans' life faster and easier. To exemplify this, my grandparents used to send letters to each other in the past in order to communicate as there was no other devices or any internet connection. As a result, it took more than a week for those letters to be delivered and some of their letters were lost during the delivery. Moreover, they needed to sail overseas back then, which took them a week to meet each other, because there was no other convenient transportation like air travel. They said life was more difficult during their time compared to now. Ċ In conclusion, although people can become too dependent on living the easy life with highly developed ways to contact others like air travel and telecommunications, I strongly believe their advantages far outweigh the disadvantages because they improve humans' lives by making things more convenient, comfortable, and suitable in today's digital world."
11086,Some people believe that technology has made people’s lives easier while others think the opposite. Which do you believe and why? Give explanations and examples to support your opinion.,"The advancement in technology over the last century has been phenomenal, affecting the ways of life in several ways. While some opine that technology has made the life of people simple, others contradict. This essay will emphasize on my opinion on how the technological growth has aided in providing an easy lifestyle to the common man and elaborate on the same with supporting evidences. Ċ Firstly, I would like to explain how the improvement in telecommunication sector is revolutionizing the interaction among people on an everyday basis. Today, most of the communication happens over e-mails, phone calls, SMS, Whatsapp, etc. Because of these various advancements, it has become possible for everyone to reach out to their counterparts or business partners instantly and that saves a lot of time. For example, before the invention of emails, doing business was cumbersome and time-consuming because of heavy reliance on the uncertain postal system, whereas now all formal interactions happen seamlessly over emails and other methods. Ċ Let’s consider another major area of technological innovation, namely transportation. In current times, an individual can travel to any destination in any part of the World within 24 hours. Isn’t this truly a revolution? For instance, a journey from USA to India would have taken months, before the invention of aeroplanes. But fortunately, now it only takes 12 hours to reach India from USA by flight. The growth in transportation has brought upon a positive impact on the way people move around the World, promoting Economy and development. This sector has also led to the promotion of various other industries such as tourism, trade, etc. Ċ In conclusion, it can be inferred that technological development in various spheres such as travel, telecommunication, safety and security, has supported the mankind tremendously. Therefore, it is clear that our lives are made a lot easier, smooth and simple by technology. Further, it is recommended that the future innovations take into account the overall well-being of the society, ecology and environment, while providing comfort to the public."
11087,"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. Do you agree or disagree? growing company means more value for the community","Entrepreneur activities as a vital part in the social development. Although emparking on market share to build up company is commitment of managers, it also is significant to mention about social responsibilities as one of requirements of business. In this case, I totally agree with this pointview. Ċ Organisation should pay more attention to business development with the contribution of economy. Firstly, the growth of a firm can attract more talents to work for their system. If a company indicates best practices of their vision to recruit people, recruitment team of that company will have a chance to overcome unemployment of human resource of a region. There are some factories that are set up to places as a good direction to create more jobs for local people. Secondly, government have considered business expansion such a source to pay taxes for them investing others section. This kind of budget is a tool of government. With the development of country, enterprise tax can help the government to grow education system, strenghthen their policies or expanding highway. Ċ Enterprise blends into social responsibilites with the power to create change.

11088,I would be grateful if you spare your time to correct and mark my essay Question: Some people think that newly built houses should follow the style of old houses in local areas. Others think that people should have freedom to buid houses of their own style. Do you agree or disagree with this view? imitating the local housing trend,"Opinions diverge greatly on whether or not newly errected buildings are forced to retain the similar architecture with the previous one. From my perspective, I would contend that house owners should feel free to design their accommodations in their own way. Ċ It is unequal for architects to obey the same style for quarters in a region. Copying merchanically ways of construction might be associated with obstructing their creative ability. This may be explained by the fact that designing a house is still considered as a genre of art which enables builders and designers to show off their asthetic capabilities. This means that each architect has their own method and distictly different criteria in assessing a quarter as being well-appointed. For instant, some tend to take a keen interest in blending between tradditional and modern styles while vintage designed housing becomes more favourable for others. Ċ Another reason for this is that following the same architecture might be attributed to a monotonous and dull picture for the area. In fact, what new accommodation are formulated to look indifferent with the old one disregard the appearance element. The beauty of the way housing being constructed, conversely, becomes one of the appealing part in visitors'eyes when they set their foot to the local area. This is because something outstanding and special seems to leave unforgetable memory. Ċ From all existing justification mentioned above, I am firmly of the opinion that imitating the housing trend might be superficial on account of the architect's creativity hinderance and tediousness in design."
11089,It is usually foolish to get married before completing your studies and getting established in a good job. Do you agree or disagree? marriage vs diploma,"With the rapid development of the society more and more people are getting married before finishing studies and settling good job. Some are in favor of getting married before finishing studies is foolish, considering that there is no stable income source and the young students are not mature enough. But I disagree with that, in my opinion, by getting married in college the two people can benefit a lot from a range of measures, for example take responsibility, get closer and so on. Ċ It is usually true that students do not have good income source and depend on parents financially, but this should not be an issue for getting married in college. The marriage is more about live together happily instead of money. Students have a lot of time to study together, build common interests and so on, all these will help them to strengthen the connection. Ċ Moreover, getting married means the two people will take responsibility for each other and behave differently from before. Such change will get the couple to think and plan their future life and career more carefully, they can get mature during the process. The earlier the couple learn taking responsibility the better will they behave in the community, this in turn will benefit the society. And it is obvious nice having the two people study and discuss questions together, that can boost the efficiency of studying. Ċ Taking considered measures, getting married in college should be supported and encouraged by the society, since it can benefit not only the two students but also the whole society. With more happy and good marriages in college were our life and the society to be better."
11090,More and more people think that there is no need for printed paper newspapers. To what extend do you agree or disagree.,"Since a few years ago, technology is changing too many things worldwide. Nowadays, printed paper newspapers are losing popularity because too many believe that they are not necessary anymore. I partially agree with the statement due to the environmental issues related to paper material. Yet, there exists some drawbacks that should be taken into account. Ċ On the one hand, diminishing the number of paper-based newspapers could be highly beneficial. For instance, some environmental advantages such as less water pollution and less paper waste are crucial. These days, readers have several options to find news. Electronic devices are solving individuals problems. So, having access to cellphones, iPadsCorrect your spellingiPodsThe word iPads is not in our dictionary. If you’re sure this spelling is correct, you can add it to your personal dictionary to prevent future alerts. Ċ or laptops is the main benefit. Also, some people are only interested in reading just one part of the material. Then, it is not necessary to purchase the entire product, using websites could solve this situation. However, some individuals can not buy technology items due to the high prices. Ċ On the other hand, some inhabitants are not familiar with some technological devices yet. For example, older people could not know how to search through the internet. They will need assistance to keep enjoying daily information. Some others could be afraid of using personal computers. Even some regions have poor internet access. So, interrupting the regular delivery of paper-based news in some cities could decrease dramatically the number of readers. Moreover, too many people are facing view problems. Therefore, reading with glasses throughout bright screens could be harmful to some of them. Ċ To conclude, more and more options are appearing to sustain reading habits. Although environmental advantages are essentials, a high number of readers are steel willing and well-using printed material. For those reasons, I can not completely say that newspaper printed format is not needed."
11091,"In the past when students did a university degree they tend to study in their own country. Nowaday they have more opportunity to study abroad. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this development. You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience to support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.","Nowadays, more and more students dream to go abroad for getting a degree and looking the world in close aspects. Reality has proven this transforming is latent of merits concur with demerits. Ċ Going abroad to study means getting a better environment, coming in for a more professional system of academic education. Moreover, going out from country generates great values, even those benefits are the majority for desiration to come to another country. Students get opportunities of exposing many kind of cultures, magnificent history and diverse policy, all those predictors create knowledge and improve noteworthy experiences. In many international corporations, a degree from developed countries is much more respected than a degree from developing countries or underdeveloped countries. All the viewpoints are critiqued, with such attractive benefits, as a consequence, so many youths have demands for traveling to a high- technology nation for university. Ċ All the coins have two sides, this feature is not an exceptional situation. It is easy to dedicate that, going abroad takes an economic burden on poor family by the virtue of expensive cost of living in rich countries such as : Australia, United Kingdom, the USA,... School fees is also a problem unless students is a candidate of schoolarship or having got a grant. Additionally, the diverse of life environment can cause cultural shock and increasings the feeling of stray. However, graduated students who have adapted to all problems prefer to get a job and have a long stable living in that country than come back to their nation. This phenomenon is called ""bleeding grey matter"". Ċ After analysing all the viewpoints, my opinion is steady that going abroad is a magnificent experience, students should go abroad to broaden their horizon, however, they ought to consider it carefully and have fully preparations."
11092,"Cutting down forests is a real environmental threat; yet, this is still happening at a great rate around the world. Why do you think forests are being destroyed? Are there any benefits from the destruction of forests?","It is an undeniable fact that deforestation is occurring on a large scale in the whole world even though it is perilous. I personally opine that forests are being cut down to provide people with more space to live and the destruction of forests does not cause benefits but it leads to various other major issues. Ċ To begin with, due to the population explosion, people need more space to live, so they are changing forests into livable places. Everyone needs a house to live in. Moreover, with the advancement in technology, the government wants to provide modern facilities to its citizens for which they are transforming forests into huge malls and hospitals. For example, in the U.S. Almost 40% of the forest area has been changed into the hospital and residential areas. Ċ However, there are numerous problems which have been caused due to deforestation. Firstly, in this way we are destroying the natural habitat of the animals. As a result, some animals are on the brink of extinction because they are not getting a suitable environment to fulfil their needs. Secondly, it also leads to an increase in pollution levels. Since trees help in the conversion of gases which are harmful to the environment and purify the air. For instance, a recent survey report revealed that the pollution level has increased by 20% since 2016. Ċ In conclusion, although forest are being cleared to provide shelter to people, it has negative impacts on the environment. It is recommended that the government should take the necessary step to control deforestation and to maintain a healthy environment."
11093,More and more companies are allowing employees to work at home. Do you think it is a positive or negative development?,"It is obvious that nowadays most employers are giving working from home opportunities to their jobholders. In my view, it is a positive development. In this essay, I will explain my support by analysing how this chance save the time of both and helps talent to reach out to a great company without the boundary of physical barrier. Ċ One of the most important merits of working from home is to be able to work more and spend less time on nonimportant things. This assist employee and employer to utilize that moment of preparing and riding. Additionally, if an engineer has to go to the office the preparation and commute to the location can be utilized to research the project. This would definitely help to increase productivity. Therefore, providing associate performing virtually has an affirmative effect on both parties' life. Ċ Furthermore, many talented people, as well as organizations who are searching for matching skills and assignments out there, will get an opportunity to work for each other. There are many talents who can not come physically due to long-distance but has strong interest and knowledge in that particular field, which they would like to exercise virtually. For example, this facility resolves the problem of en-suit work such as using information technology many computer-related tasks can be completed without presenting at the destination. Ċ In conclusion, I strongly believe that letting people finish their duty through a computer network is completely plus point which adds value to company and worker as well by keeping less second for the unproductive sector. Moreover, by doing so both of them will be able to find their best match a competent and intelligent manager for job provider and the best working environment for job seekers."
11094,Many people choose to work or live abroad because of the higher standards of Ċ living they can find outside their home country. Ċ Do you think this brings more advantages or disadvantages to the people who follow this Ċ path?,"A rising number of people prefer to emigrate to foreign countries considering the improved lifestyle and standard of living these places offer. While, this might be true to some extent, I personally feel that every person should consider the pros and cons of the same and in my viewpoint the disadvantages far extend the advantages for people who prefer this. People are usually unaware of the cost of living in these countries and most of them ending up taking jobs that are below the qualifications they have acquired. Ċ Firstly, migration to a developed country comes with higher expenses that are often underestimated by people.They convert their income earning capacity based on the foreign currency and although this might be very close to their home currency, they get lured by the same. In some instances, the income earned might be significantly lower, which is further worsened if the person has taken leverage.So, effectively some end up with a lower standard of living. Ċ Secondly, in most countries the degrees that have been earned from one's universities are often not accepted. Furthermore, the work experiences earned from abroad are underrated which leads to many people taking a setback in their work life. For instance, some professional qualifications like accountants and doctors are forced to take up further studies which are often very expensive and forces people to further increase their debt obligations. Ċ In conclusion, one should carefully analyse immigration and the prospects carefully because it involves complete relocation to another country. It involves transferring of families, assets and being completely away from one's home.If the country you are planning to move does not provide you with a significant markup in terms of living standards, and does not recognize your hard earned qualification, then I am of the opinion that you should reconsider your decision."
11095,"'Born' artist or the one who learned the arts Kindly assess my essay by giving a band. my score target is 6.5 Some people say that art (eg. Painting, music, poetry, etc...) can be made by everyone whereas others believe that it can only be made by those with special ability. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","One of the most controversial issues among people relates to practise of art. while some people consider that making art is a speciality, others take the view that everyone is able to carry out a certain number of art. In this essay, I am going to examine this question from both points of view. Ċ On one side of the argument, there are people who argue that by making art, they can find pleasure and practise a hobby. Many people choose playing sport, doing music or writing poetry because this allows them to enjoy their spare time although they are not professionals. One good illustration of this is painting our bedroom or apartment by ourselves can positively affect our mood which will provide us a sense of achievement. It is also possible to say that practising art is a manner to reach mental balance. Ċ On the other hand it is also possible to argue that in fact art has compulsorily to be made by those with high ability and capacity. People often have this opinion because art like : sport, painting and poetry are considered as professions and specialities that require perfection when exercising. In order to get a groundbreaking painting or an original peotry, most of people trust in reliable professionals. Ċ As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question, on balance however, I tend to believe that everyone is allowed to practise the kind of art he likes since this permits him to follow his passion and makes him feel comfortable."
11096,1.	Some people believe that the most important aspect of their job is their salary. Others think that the job itself is the most important. What do you think is the most important aspect of a job? Include specific details and examples to support your choice.,"Individuals around the world have different considerations about how they are evaluating employment opportunities. While some would argue that financial rewarding is the standard, I agree with those who believe that other factors are more crucial. Ċ On the one hand, there are few justifications for people who choose the amount of wage over other jobs elements. Firstly, they could be focusing on securing themselves financially and hence, they need extra cash flow for that. Good-paying careers can provide a stable monetary resource for such people. For example, banks can offer saving plans for those with higher than average salaries and they pay profits for them. Additionally, some might consider jobs as an opportunity where it cannot be always yours. Because companies are always tending to find better-skilled personnel to run their business. Therefore, the wages people are getting is an important aspect to them. Ċ On the other hand, I would argue that the job itself is important because of two main reasons. The first reason can be the goals and aims of that position. There are some duties that can contribute positively to different international problems. For instance, staff who are working face environmental challenges and water scarcity problems. These roles have extremely benefited the world, regardless of the salaries offered for workers. Another factor can be the stability of the job. It would always be a better option for selecting a job especially if there are family obligations and responsibilities. As a result, it is prefered by some to consider stable jobs with goals that suit their background. Ċ To conclude, the aspect of looking for a certain job can vary from one person to another. Payment, stability, and job perspectives can all guide us to select a certain career. However, I do recommend looking to other factors and letting the financial rewarding be the last of our selection criteria."
11097,Some people believe that too many resources and attention are devoted to the protection of wild animals and birds. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"In the current times, one of the most trending topics is the future of wild beings. Few populaces think that animals and birds in the wild are given extreme importance through various means, and other people believe that this is not the case. I strongly assert that attention and benefits are provided to these habitants way more than required, and this essay will throw some light on the reasons for my opinion. Ċ At first, media plays an important role in sympathizing news pertaining to endangered species; however, the reality looks extremely diverse as the statistics provided by the news channels is not always true. Secondly, although hunting has been an integral part of our society for many centuries, it has been condemned only for the last few years. The reason for this is because of the involvement of some famous personalities in such events, and anything they do becomes a flash story for everyone to talk about. It has been observed that despite the percentage of hunting wild animals and birds by many Bollywood stars is minimal, they seem to have come under the radar way more than those who actually commit this act frequently. Ċ Furthermore, adoption and donation have started becoming popular, and many authorities availing these benefits are not fulfilling their responsibilities due to the cushion they have been provided. For instance, many individuals adopt wild species in the Zoo, and they take care of the entire expense that is incurred; nevertheless, the management of these wild parks collect the same entry fee from the public despite getting donations from people. It is noticed that this trend has come to popularity only in the last decade and more than 50% of Zoos are replicating this strategy to reap the benefits. Ċ In conclusion, I completely believe that humans have given extreme resources and attention to wild beings, either in the form of media hype or high net worth individuals donating money, and these things have been utilized incorrectly in many ways."
11098,Many people think that the behavior of professional sportsmen off the field is not important as long as they are good players. To what extent do you agree or disagree with it?,"It is a common opinion nowadays that the behaviour of professional athletes outside the playground does not matter if they are performing great on the field. Even though some people favour this idea, there is a tremendous part of society that does not support the notion. In this essay, I will discuss and provide reasons why I completely disagree with such belief. Ċ Firstly, the main ground for my opinion is that great sportsmen are generally influencing and inspiring huge population masses starting from the youth ending with the elderly. For example, famous football players are known for their charity work. These individuals are of great benefit to society as they often visit kids with severe health conditions, such as cancer, thus encouraging them to fight for their lives. Furthermore, players like Messi and Ronaldo have demonstrated tremendous effort in encouraging youth football players to stick with the hobby and develop further. Ċ Secondly, being a nice person outside the game is crucial for the player’s career development as it attracts various companies who would like to conclude the promotion contracts with the athletes for advertisement purposes. For instance, a famous tennis player Maria Sharapova has drawn business entities begging her to advertise their products. Moreover, such income has allowed establishing a brand of her own. Upon completion of the athletic career, this will be a solid base for income. Ċ In conclusion, despite others think that lifestyle outside the field is insignificant, I strongly disagree with their point. In my view encouraging society, stimulating sports development and investment in future career are of tremendous importance for sportsmen across the world."
11099,Some people believe that it is a good idea that older people continue to work if it is possible for them to do. Do you agree or disagree ?,"As an increase, the retirement age has escalated in recent years in developed countries. Whether the elderly residents should be empowered to continue with their occupation if it is still feasible for them. While there are admittedly several drawbacks to this perspective, I believe that the positive influences are more glaring. Ċ To begin with, it is understandable why some people are unlikely to subscribe to the view that senior citizens should not embark on their favourite jobs. First and foremost, people at the age of sixty and more regularly suffer from various health problems such as high blood pressure, stroke or heart attack. In light of this, some heavy workloads can take a toll on both their mental and physical health. Thus, instead of spending time competing at labour pains. They should be retired to enjoy the rest of life with their relatives. Finally, the influx of old people into the labour market is the primary driving force behind the rising youth unemployment. For example, many elderly candidates compete with younger ones for their jobs since they gained more hands-on experience than these young employees. As a result, a huge amount of young candidates must leave off the working environment. Ċ Nevertheless, despite the aforementioned drawbacks, I would convince that older employees can bring a host of benefits to their community. On the one hand, those who spend more time taking part in community services and volunteer work in their retirement support to alleviate government spending in some fields such as health care and environmental protections. Additionally, when working with satisfaction in these jobs, the elderly can avoid experiencing feelings of isolation and loneliness. On the other hand, a sheer number of older unemployment put heavy pressure on health systems and social care because they need more state funding for these problems. Therefore, if they can continue earning a living, the government responsibilities will decrease to focus on another important concern. Ċ In conclusion, I opined that old generation should be taken after by their family and also the government coffers. However, there is no right to limit our grandparents to enjoy their own life as maintaining their favourite career ."
11100,Many young people move out of their homes to live alone or to live with their friends. Some people think this is a good idea. Ċ Do you agree or disagree with this opinion? Ċ Give examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In this contemporary era, many youngsters prefer to live alone else with their friends. School thoughts consider this as the best option. So, I associate myself with the given line of thought. Ideas articulated in this essay will support my stand. Ċ To begin with, a lot of people in particular younger ones are moving to their new home to live alone or with their loved friends. This trend brings more fruitful outputs for them as it provides them independence for making their decision. Due to this, they can freely decide their stand on the topics which matter to them most without anyone’s influence. If the verdict proved not correct then they are taking it as a lesson and experience subsequently in upcoming life there are more chances of gaining success as they do not repeat the same mistake. A recent case study in the USA revealed that those people who left their parents’ home an adolescent age are proved as successful as compared to those who didn’t initiate this step. Ċ Another reason to upload my notion is when someone starts living in a new destination then unknowingly he or she learns the culture as well the language of the host place. As they acquire a culture of that place then their personality also reaches the top level. FurthermoreAdd a comma,FurthermoreIt appears that you are missing a comma after the introductory phrase Furthermore. Consider adding a comma. Ċ show examples communication skills are enhanced so they can easily narrate their stand to someone although anyone who is against that. last year, in India one research had concluded that those younger people are living alone or with their friends having more knowledge on any topic regardless of their field. Ċ To conclude, I strongly believe that in order to enjoy your life to the fullest point individual need to live alone. As this living style gives more output as compared with living with parents."
11101,protect the wildlife means protect ourselves. Zoos are often seen as important but poor alternatives to allowing animals to remain in their natural environmentm. Discuss the advangtages and disadvantages of keeping animals in captivity and then give your opinion.,"It is plausible that zoos has given the nature several positive impacts by preserve animals in capivity. On the other hand, it is argubly desperately condemned that some inevitable consequences cause the animals's aptitude and attitude changing compared to their natural kind in the artificial territories. However, I am strongly convinced that zoos is the most esseintial security system for the wild life. Ċ First of all, some negative affects are calling our name worldwide. Animals's natural proliferation beyonded all the dispute will be limited and the zoos certainly to take the most significant responsibilities of the animal's losing their elemental behaviours. For instance, recent studies has indicaed that the animals are getting more and more tedious and regaredless to the others. It leads to a predictable consequence that zoo qualities are worsen day by day. Ċ Despite of the terrible influencesn, the reality that animals are traumatically endangered by the illegal hunting while there are no really efficient approaches has been set-up by the gorvenment therefore reduce the biodiversity. Hence, zoos are playing a unreplaceable role in the animals conservation, with the main aim to protect fauna from the brutal deeds. Futhermore, economically speaking, zoos have contributed an paramount prominent globally in nations's economy especially african countries with the prestigious paremeters. Ċ In conclusion, I particiularly agree with the statement that zoos are necessary for the human race in order to preservate animals because species interact each other. As a true result, protect the wildlife is protect ourselves."
11102,Subject : Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.,"Nowadays attending classes in universities is a very controversial issue that everybody has his own ideas about this matter. Some people might suggest that going to classes should not be mandatory, I personally believe that it should be obligatory for students.There are two main reasons why I think students should be required to attend classes. Ċ One of the reasons for this is that students learn better when they attend all classes. As a salient example for this is that students have the chance to ask their questions immediately to their teachers and it facilitates students learning. Secondly, while students spend a lot of time to comprehend subjects on their own, with teachers' help they can learn effective techniques to solve questions and to understand them. To my view, if students are obliged to attend classes, they can acquire information much eaisier and more effectively than studying alone. Ċ Secondly and more importantly,coming to classes improves students' social relations. Firstly, a student who comes to classes regularly can meet his classmates, have chats with them and share his happiness and sadness. Another example for this is that universities have lots of activities that students can join, enjoy their time and make new friends. Otherwise, when students study on their own and lock themselves in their rooms, making friends and having social relations become harder. In my opinion, it effects students' life in a good way in terms of having better relations with people. Ċ In short, for the reasons above, I once again restate my view that students should be obliged to attend classes on the grounds that they can learn excellently and have a better social life if they visit the university often."
11103,"Food standards in education Scientists agree that many people eat too much junk food and it is damaging their health. Some people think that this problem can be solved by educating people, while others believe that education will not work. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","In recent years, there are a large number of people having obsessed with junk food, therefore, researchers believe that this phenomenon will result in health problems. Although some people argue that such issues can be addressed through education, others hold opposite perspective on it. In this essay, I will breakdown both thoughts and state my own view. Ċ Advocates state that inculcating consumers with healthy dietary style is undoubtedly the best solution because of raising concerns on nutritional values. It is their view that a large proportion of customers ignores the fact that these unhealthy food is invariably high in sugar and salt. Nonetheless, with modest education, understanding the consequences of consuming an excessive amount of junk food can help them realise the importance of forming a wholesome dietary habit. As a result, they believe that consumers will ultimately alter their diet patterns by decreasing the frequencies of purchasing such merchandise or increasing the intake of greenery vegetables. Ċ However, opponents think that it is impossible to reduce individual's addiction to junk food merely by education. They believe that the vast majority of consumers clearly know the detrimental effects on health, however, because of its convenience and low cost, they cannot help being a slave to such products. In addition, they also insist that education will only have negligible effects if related national policies do not regulate the advertisements and promotions on junk food. For instance, government can pose higher taxations on these products and limit the content of junk food advertising, so that fewer customers will be attracted by relatively low prices and appealing marketing strategies. Ċ In conclusion, although education plays a significant role in ceasing people from overconsuming junk food, I firmly believe that it is inevitably never enough to resolve the issues. Concreted efforts should also be executed by national administrations."
11104,"Some people believe that taxing companies, which cause it, is the best way to reduce industrial pollution while some suggest that there are several other ways to solve this trouble. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.","In recent times, the hazardous waste emitted by organizations had a detrimental impact on the environment. To reduce this phenomenon few individuals believe that levying a high tax would help to combat this situation, whereas others argue that alternative methods should be adopted. This essay intends to discuss both perspectives. I, however, opine with the lateral view. Ċ To begin with, imposing heavy charges on corporations would help the government to have enough capital for cleaning up and reducing pollution. In addition, this amount collected from factories would help the governing authority to employ correct equipment for eradicating industrial waste. Following this, it would also put pressure on the industries to reduce perilous extracts to save themselves from paying a hefty tax. For example, studies suggest that companies imposed with ponderous taxes have later reduced emitting pollutant particles by 40%. Ċ On the contrary, the country's high authorities can mandate firms to set up effluent-treatment plants. Additionally, subsidies can be provided for such projects to motivate manufacturers. For instance, the water contamination caused by effluents from chemical industries is controlled to a great extent by implementing plans for treating the pollutants. Secondly, a law should be passed to plant several trees around these private operational bodies. As a result, plants help to reduce the dangerous gases in the air, thus, purifying it. As an example, in Singapore, strict rules of planting trees around every industry has helped them to be a pollution-free nation. Ċ To conclude, the benefit of taxation implied to overcome the exploitation of nature can be limited, moreover, the gains achieved by the substitutional measures such as tree plantation and subsidizing the pollutant-treatment project are overpowering."
11105,"shaping children's well-being Topic: For school children, their teachers have more influence on their intelligence and social development than their parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Children of young ages are easily affected by the adults around them, in terms of intelligence and social development. Although it is true that teachers have more significant impact on children's academic knowledge, I believe parents are more responsible for their socialization. Ċ The school teachers' job are meant to broaden the knowledge of children and enhance their abilities. All teachers must have gone through strict education and training, making them qualified enough to help their students to discover new horizons. In addition, teachers have indispensable skills in working with children, take care of their different individual needs and at the same time deal with unexpected situations, especially when it comes to young kids. Besides, the subjects students learn at school are theoretical knowledge that changes children's concept of the world. Certainly, teachers are the most suitable adults to orientate them. Ċ On the other hand, the role of improving children's social life is for their parents. It is undeniable that parents are the first people that kids reach out to when they encounter problems, as well as their initial role models. Children tend to imitate their parents' speech and behaviors. Moreover, compared to teachers, parents spend much more time with their own children - more time for kids to pick up good characteristics from their parents. The bond between them is extremely powerful and heartfelt, same as how strong parents' influence on children is. Ċ In conclusion, both parents and teachers hold vital positions in shaping children's well-being. While teachers role is leading them to the world of intellectual knowledge, parents are responsible for developing their social life."
11106,International organizations have failed to help everyone who needs help so they should only focus on helping the poor people in their own countries. To what extent do you agree?,"With limited money, international organizations, indeed, could not manage to help every needed person. But it doesn't mean that the international community should only provide help to their own poverty-stricken citizens. From my perspective, International organizations have irreplaceable obligation to help the poor. Ċ The purpose of establishing international organizations is help. For example, the World Bank composed by affluent countries offers lower-interest loans to the poor countries. Through this way, the less wealthy countries have enough money to develop the infrastructure facilities, such as roads and pipeline, which could generate massive job opportunities. As more job vacancies will be provided, more lay-off workers in the poor countries could make a living by themselves. Therefore, the living standard of the local people could be apparently improved. Ċ Maybe it seems unfair to the wealthy countries which still have the poor people in their own countries. It is true that the action to help the poor in other countries will damage the interests of the taxpayers in the affluent countries. However, it isn't unfair if we consider the fact that hundreds of thousands of the poor are under starvation in other countries in contrast to fewer poor people in the wealthy countries. Ċ Even though the international organizations have failed to help every the needed, offering help will still make a difference in change the imbalance of fortune in the globe. Without international aid, a large number of poor people may die of starvation in the year to come. Further, the poor may take violent measures, such as stealing, to support their lives, which may drive up the crime rate and cause inability in the country as well. Ċ To conclude, international aid is necessary, despite a few countries will benefit. For the wealthy countries, they should give priority to the needed in their own countries before helping the poor in other countries."
11107,Some people think that zoos are cruel and should be closed down. Others however believe that zoos can be useful in protecting wild animals. Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.,"Many individuals have an opinion that the places where animals are kept should be shut down due to the vicious nature of them. while on the other hand, some contends that these wildlife centuries could be necessary to prevent the ecological balance or endangered species. I shall articulate my view in the next paragraphs. Ċ To commence with, the masses who suggest to wipe out the regions where livings are taken care of, often say that the aggressive nature of wildlife creatures act as a threat to human beings. To illustrate, a report by the education department demonstrates that the freedom of the animals to roam freely in the same area where populace visit to see them turns out to be dangerous for humans as in the Rajasthan zoo the man was killed by the destructive lion who was not controlled by care-takers. Moreover, in zoos, the wild structures might not able to grow in which they are kept under a cage which eventually makes them vicious beasts. Therefore, it is imperative to send them to forests where they belong which further ensures their survival and growth. Ċ On the contrary, this type of structures must be kept in wildlife centuries in which proper care may be given to them which conserve them from other predators. Furthermore, their presence could act as a benefit instead of a burden in which the creatures who might not able to control by masses will be monitored by these cruel species. For instance, the tiger (predator) hunt the black deers(prey) which are not controllable by the man in those situations their preservation is necessary to sustain flora and fauna. Ċ To conclude, meanwhile, it is indispensable for humans to free the habitat species from the zoo and transferred them to forests which provide protection to humans which also beneficial for such creatures to survive or adapt without restrictions."
11108,"Issue: The surest indicator of a great nation is not the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists, but the general well-being of all its people. the comfort of a regular citizen","In general, Great is a term depicts the distinguishing qualities that make someone or something great. The statement denotes the cause to become a great nation, that depends on the comfort of general citizen.Indeed, the most plausible, significant basis of a great nation lies in the citizen's welfare. Ċ If common people get treated impartially, that is the indication of a great nation.In India, before the 21st century, there is a castism.The higher hierarchy people had been living in pleasure, while lower hierarchy people had been incurring.The nation had a wide gap between poor and rich, low class and high-class people. Higher class people were happy, in contrary lower class people suffered humiliation. In such circumstances, the nation cannot be called great. Ċ The citizen of the country plays a major role in development and advancement of the country.Each and everyone's contribution helps to regulate the country.For example, farmers provide food to us.The doctor treats people's illness.Teachers teaches people in order to aware them about the world. Everyone is special.The country becomes great with the support of these people. Ċ Many people in the country become worldwide personalities through their extraordinary achievements.Does that mean the country is great? In India, there are lots of actors with worldwide fame. Their achievements make them great.They are known as great people who belongs to India, not the people belong to the great nation.This makes a difference.The achievements of people are rather personal than national. Ċ Although scientist, artist, rulers help to enhance the development of the nation, the greatness of nation does not totally dependent on them.As a conclusion, with the every citizen of the nation, whether the citizen is an ordinary man or a famous person, the country will be a great nation by cherishing its people and take care of them."
11109,"It has been suggested that everyone in the world wants to own a car, a TV and a fridge. Do you think disadvantages of such a development outweigh advantages? the evolution of human needs","The desire of having own items is human nature. With the boost of economic development and the growing number of advertisement, raise the desire of having more and more products. Whether owing a car, a TV, even a fridge is essential or not, I think the drawbacks are by far than the benefits for following reasons. Ċ First of all, these kinds of products are certainly not necessary. I suppose the first thing people should consider before purchasing is that are they must to have? Since people are easily manipulated by ubiquitous media, which persuade people to buy the goods they actually do not require. Moreover, some people consume beyond they can afford, inevitably causing the debt they have no ability to pay. Ċ The second reason for the negative influence of this development is that it widens the gap between rich and poor people. The encouragement of having own vehicle, entertainment and electronic appliances raise the desire which can only fulfill by the wealthy instead of the poor. Under such situation, jealousness, unfairness and anger emerge. Ċ Some people may argue that the purchasing stimulates the economic. It can be partial right, however, the reasonable consumption id limited in an affordable range, which means, the over-budget consumption generate the bad consequence, dragging the economic dramatically. Ċ To sum up, the over-chasing of owing products is not encouraged. People should evaluate their financial condition and think twice before action."
11110,"It is often said that the subjects taught in schools are too academic in orientation and that it would be more useful for children to learn about practical matters such as home management, work and interpersonal skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The primary purpose of educational institutions is to produce well-versed employees capable of completing their work with efficacy. In this regard, urging schools to focus on the practical aspects of the work at hand is a laudable initiative. Nevertheless, this essay disagrees with this viewpoint because academic knowledge is of paramount importance in Specialty occupations and it helps students to deal with various circumstances in a systemic approach. Ċ To begin with, while some occupations, such as waitressing and barber, necessitate a little academic background, other fields of work such as law or medicine require a profound knowledge of the subject area. In the former situation, the know-how can easily be transmitted from the manager to the trainee. However, in the case of law and medicine, one individual is unlikely to retain such a vast amount of facts which can only be embedded in the books, explaining the years of academic studies which the student must spent before being permitted to practice. In the course of their career, modifications in law or health practices are likely to be common occurrences, requiring continuing education. As such, an academic learning is a must for certain professions. Ċ Furthermore, I personally believe that academic teaching favours the student by adopting a systemic approach which can be replicated across all situations. Practical experience often negatively biases certain students, for instance, a hairdressing trainee may only be tasked with a particular type of haircut since this is the only one demanded by the customers. Through academic teaching, school ensures that the student face all types of situation and document their material in such a way that students can easily review them at their own convenience. Ċ In conclusion, academic knowledge is of paramount importance for speciality occupations and it also provides students with approaches in all situations they may face when enter labour force. Therefore, the opinion that practical skills are more useful than academic ability cannot be supported. This essay argues that theory-based lessons should continue to be appreciated in school settings."
11111,"Some information in films, books and on the Internet has a negative influence on young people. Some people think that such information should be controlled. Give your opinion on both sides of view use your own experience and example.","Nowadays, information travels across the globe in a matter of minutes on the Internet or any type of media thanks to globalization. Despite its' several benefits, on the wrong hand, it may be used to negatively persuade the young generation into the wrong path. Likewise, there is an argument whether the content on these publishing should be regulated or not. Evidently, I strongly disagree with the statement. Ċ First of all, it is undeniable that publishing is a powerful tool for exchanging ideas globally in the 21st century. It allows people to freely express their thought, opinions or even theories to the world without any restrictions. For example, in my experience, juveniles widely use Twitter to share their concern about the current political situation in Thailand because the main channel such as TV or websites is controlled by the state. Nevertheless, they are able to communicate and share information that they found about unfairness, news or wrongdoing from the government which is not available on the other platforms. Hence, without restriction, they are able to share the world their creative works without middlemen claiming ownership and selling their arts without permission. Ċ On the other hand, many argue that false data of harmful content is easily shared and spread out if there is no regulation from authorities. Therefore, juveniles are at risk of being exposed to false facts, claims or even business deals. For illustration, I found that social media such as Tiktok are used to trick kids to join suspicious businesses, participate in dangerous trends such as digesting powdered cinnamon and many were found choking from that or even Flat earth community which influence people to believe that the earth is actually flat. Certainly, without proper control from responsible ,bodies this can lead to dangerous situations and many adverse effects from crime, physical injury or even death can be expected. Ċ In conclusion, I disagree that governments should control all the content shared in the community as it restricts the human right of thought and freedom of speech. However, the data should be limited to certain levels such as criminal activities, unproven facts or news. Thus, users should be aware and filter news before sharing as well."
11112,"In recent years, tv has contributed most to changing people's quality of life. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","These days, television has shown a greater impact on society's way of living. It is agreed that the introduction of the digital box has become a revolution that totally redefined the quality of life. Analyzing the way it revolutionalized news and entertainment industries will prove this. Ċ To begin with, Before the 19th century, the announcements to reach every nook and corner of the world was a difficult feat to achieve. To illustrate, the two popular ways of being aware of news during that time period were by the spread of mouth which often gets corrupted and turns inefficient. Likewise, newspapers which would require enormous logistics are ineffective as well. The invention of TV quickly revolutionised the world by making it easy to spread the message in the most efficient manner. So, most communities were able to get accurate information from this digital box. Ċ In addition, Firstly, the digital device provides entertainment by various genres to viewers in today's world. Some of the most popular genres viewers prefer are arts, comedy, action and horror movies and series. Secondly, television has given lively hood to several people. To illustrate, my father who is a makeup artist earns his bread from this industry. Hence, it can be clearly stated that video station has enhanced the lives of many. Ċ To sum up, TV has impacted the lives of many. For some, it's merely a source of entertainment and news while for others, it's the livelihood. It can be completely agreed that the TV's contribution showed a positive impact on the lives of many people."
11113,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on the society.","It is impossible to disprove that fact to the number of science students was shrinking when compared to other discipline. This trend has been increasing and causing many problems. An upcoming paragraph will analyse some explanation for this reason. Ċ Firstly, to study a science subject requires hard work and patience. Many students around the world does not have those qualities due to this, they choose any easy stream (such as commerce and engineering) and these students indulge in leisure. In one instance, after completing four years in science, they require to do another two year course in any specific subject to become a specialist. Students have to devote their lives for 4 to 6 years in university and they want to have that passion about that subject since it will motivate them. Secondly, getting jobs for science students is very difficult in this competitive world, whereas other degree students having more number of opportunities Ċ As a result, there will be a shortage in a research field and this would bring more problem to our society. Science field is a very important subject in the earth because nowadays people do not care their health an account of this many of them affected by various kinds of disease. If students decreased in this area, then many innovative ideas which will come from mind would be disappeared and it will create more pressure on exciting practitioner. Ċ To conclude, although having many difficulties in science, it will give the best future for who worked hard. Moreover, the world needs their service to acquire a healthy life."
11114,Some people believe that part time job can ensure better job opportunities in future. Others think job can easily distract students from study. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is a great debate between community members whether a part-time job may provide opportunities for a job or will hinder scholars from completing their studies effectively.As we see nowadays because of huge technological evolution, many individuals tend to have some tasks besides their studies, which I extremely agree with. Ċ One point is that some population think work may cause a distraction for juniors ,and decrease their application quality. such this public need pupils to focus more on their studies and learning process,for example, they just go to school and come back home to memorize and study their lectures. this point of view greatly emphasizes undergraduates .As a result, they will miss gradually a crucial part of social life, like meeting new folk and detecting some different cultures. Ċ On the other hand,working along with study helps them to gain new skills and experience ,irrespective to the field which they work in .for instance knowing how the world is ongoing ,in addition ,learning patience,hard-working and many other good characteristics furthermore they will be capable of gaining money to use it not only for buying their special items but also to go for picnics and journeys and enjoy life.so I think that a part-time career along with class is important from all perspectives. Ċ To conclude , there may be many attitudes and points of view towards the issue of having a part-time activity or being free for studying only.I see that if learners are working and studying at the same time ,this will open their minds and comprehension levels,hence it will have a better impact on their lives."
11115,"A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college. Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim. In developing and supporting your position, be sure to address the most compelling reasons and/or examples that could be used to challenge your position.","All students should study the same national carriculum at the school level is the main issue. when students study the same carriculum then they can be judged equally. Students are judged by a certain examination at the time of admission in the college. A examination is based on certain types of fact in the questions and the student can answere only if he/she can understand these facts. so if the all the students have study the same carriculum then they all are perform equally. Ċ for example, in India, IIT examnination held for admission in bechlor of technology(an engineering course). million of students appread in the examination. these students studied different-different course in their higher school carriculum. so students that studied the higher school in english medium can easily fight the examination and the students who are differernt background fight difficulties to clear the examination. And things does not end here, these students find more difficulty when they admitted in college and studied the same subjects which is difficult for other background students rather then english background students. Ċ Take a another example of GRE examination, students find it difficult to chase the examination as all the students have different backgrounds. Students whose mother tounge or native language is english they can easily clear the examination: and other nation whose native language is other then english find it quite difficult, though, they can chase the exam. Ċ at last, if the student studied the same nation carriculum then they can equally perform in all the field of test then the real meaning of the examination reflect. so, at my stand, all the students must study the same carriculum."
11116,It is more important to have a good family than to have friends. Family can always compensate for absence of friendship. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is often believed that a good family provides better support when friends are not available. I entirely find the aforementioned statement to be logically sound as we live in a more comfortable environment and we can get financial help from our parents as compared to companions. Ċ Most importantly, one can feel convenient to share his problems with the family. The reason behind this fact is that a person has been lived with his family since birth; therefore, parents and other members are well aware of his behaviour as well as help out in various issues. Consequently, they may not only advise in an appropriate way but also present mental support to the individual whereas friends are not too mature to give advice to them. For instance, in the research done by University students, it is found that 80% of people prefer to ask for help in trouble from their immediate family members than mates. Ċ Besides feeling comfortable with family, one can get financial help from them than friends. This is due to his biological relationship with his parents; they have selfless love. Owing to which parents provide full monetary support to their children whenever they need it without expecting it back. On the other hand, friends can help with money to a certain extent only as they are not well grown to be economically sound. Hence, parents keep rolling until their children get settled in their life with jobs. To exemplify, had my friend’s father spent money on his education and fulfilling all his needs, he would not have been selected in a reputed company such as Amazon. Ċ In conclusion, since it is always satisfying and economically beneficial to be with family. I am convinced that family can have the upper hand rather than friends."
11117,"In many countries these days, the number of people continuing their education after school has increased,and the range of courses available at universities and colleges has also increased. Do you think this as a positive or negative development","In today's modern world new developments can be cited in every field,education is no exemption. In recent years more and more number of people are seen persisting higher education, also a wide range of courses are now offered at universities and colleges. I perceive this as a positive advancement. Ċ Varoius reasons can be assigned to support this statement.Firstly, increase in number of persons with higher education have benefitedany country's overall progress,as they can earn more and eventually can pay more taxes.Also companies and employers can now have more employees who are trained and familiar with relevant job profile. Also as an individualit is never too late to study and hence by studing more one can develop as a knowlegable ,more cultured and more responsible person. Ċ Further, universities and colleges are now offeringa variety of courses alongwith the traditional courses.Even this aspect have optimistic effects. This wide range of courses helps a student to comply with his subject of interest. Also this leads a possibility of exploring new fields. It even helps in employment as many options can be available. Addition of some contemporary courses like music,art,acting have made people to see this fieldwith more respect and helped its perseveres professionaly. Ċ Hence to sumup, I believe that knowledge never goes waste hence it is a positve advancement that more number of people are opting to study after school and also the universities are now providing more diverse courses facilitating people to after school"
11118,"huge salaries to sports stars? Some people believe that the salaries paid to professional sportspeople are too high, while others argue that sports salaries are fair. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","People have different views about the amount of money paid to top sportspeople. While there are some good arguments in favor of the idea that these athletes are overpaid, in my opinion they receive fair salaries. Ċ The main reason why many people might disapprove of high salaries of sportspeople is that they do not make much contribution to society despite their huge income. Many skilled athletes earn much more than workers in other professions, like teachers and doctors, even though their roles are not as vital as these workers. Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi, for example, took in $127 million from his salary, earnings and endorsements. By contrast, high school teachers in the United States made a median salary of $60,320 in 2018; the best-paid 25 percent made $77,720 that year. Most people believe that we should therefore value professionals such as nurses and teachers more highly. Ċ However, I believe that the best sportspeople deserve to earn a lot of money. Firstly, being a top sports player requires years of practice and hard-work, and in this regard athletes could set good examples for young people. Secondly, a sports star usually has millions of fans who are willing to pay to see him or her play. Finally, sport is a multi-million-dollar industry; there are many firms that want to use popular sportspeople for advertising purposes, by making considerable investment into advertising their products. In Lionel Messi's case, $37 million of his income came from endorsements. Ċ In conclusion, although there are good arguments against paying huge salaries to sports stars, I would argue that they deserve the money they earn."
11119,"When people need to complain about a product or poor service, some people to complain in writing and others prefer to complain in person. Which way do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.","Grievance is unsatisfaction about quality. Usually, folk complaint about goods and poor merit. There are two ways grievance likes writing or face to face. Actually, the both choose it similar purpose to accomplish a complaint. I prefer grievance by writing. Therefore, it is economical cost and waste time. Ċ Quality Assurance is guarantee about product quality, when customer gets defect product or poor service therefore QA receive about grievance client. In this case, customer sends complaint by writing because for thrifty cost. Sometimes, folk prefer writing because they have not tome for meeting face to face. So that, writing is alternative to complaint. There are two kinds send complaint by writing. Firstly. We send grievance by email which type writing prefer by almost people. Secondly, writing complaint by post. Usually, it grievance send document and things which relation with complaint. For instance. ADR group is company assembly oil filter. Everyday, it always receive writing about complaint defect filter and kinds of complaint writing and post. Because, almost people think send complaint by writing is saving cost. So, i prefer complaint by writing because saving cost. Ċ I prefer complaint by writing because we do not waste time. Usually, we need time for complaint to person. Because, we should have enough time meet person. So, complaint by writing is more comfortable than another method and waste time. For example, Mr. Anton is manager QA at PT. PJM which is customer PT. XXX. He has many activity at company. One day, he want to complaint about his product but Mr. Anton does not time for meet person. After that, he always send writing. Because, writing is saving time. So, if we complaint to meet person is waste time. Ċ In conclusion, complaint by writing more effective than meet person. Because, complaint by writing gives benefits such as economical cost and waste time."
11120,"Some people think that children should learn to read from traditional paper books, while others feel that it is fine to start the reading process on an e-reader (like a Kindle or iPad). Ċ Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.","Nowadays, young folk tend to study on e-book rather than old design paper books. Some people believe that they should start reading from the printed book than e-reader meanwhile other parties are the opposite. This essay will discuss both views and in last, I will give my personal opinion on this statement. Ċ On the first-hand side, juveniles should start learning to read from traditional paper the reason is that it is very convenient for them to catch information from textbooks. For example, manual books (some kinds of book special for children) has got big handwriting and quite a clear picture which make them take information quite easily and quickly. Furthermore, teenagers can retain visual information in their mind for a long period of time so it is undeniable fact that young people should start to learn reading from hard copies. Ċ On the other side of the coin, in fact, it is also undeniable that e-readers are very effective for learning not only for youngsters but for all age groups. Because of innovation in technology, nowadays electronic booklets are available in different versions such as video so if adolescents can see and hear at the same time it helps them learn even more quickly than papers or copy. But sometimes electronic gadgets might be very expensive so children from poor families can not take an advantage of this. Ċ In conclusion, this essay discussed the convenience of hard copies of text and the effectiveness of electronic editions. In my opinion, both books have their own value and similarly plays an important role in teenager's learning and reading process."
11121,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people face today are not very different from the challenges their parents and grandparents faced in the past.,"I don't think that the personal and work-related challenges that young people face today are not very different from the challenges their parents and grandparents faced in the past for the following two reasons. Ċ Firstly, with communication style changed dramatically, we have to offer communication tools more cheaply. Nowadays, we can have a conversation with each other with cell phone, Skype, Facebook or Twitter anytime anywhere in the world. On the other hand, it was not easy even to meet someone at particular time and place because they didn't have cell phones and kept in touch. Therefore, they thought of making communication more easily and developed a personal computer and a cell phone. However, most people have a PC or a cell phone now, so we have to offer a variety services making people have fun or enriching people's lives at lower costs. Ċ Secondly, in Japan, many companies have been more globalized recently, and have to cooperate with other countries and compete with not only domestic companies but also global companies. Also, there are so many companies that enlarge their business into other countries, and seek someone who can speak English. But in the past, most companies didn't need to seek bilingual, and people can work even if they can speak English. Moreover, although they got promoted by their age because there was a seniority system, this has been breaking down and they are likely to be evaluated based on their merits now. Ċ In conclusion, as stated above two reasons, the changes of communication style and work conditions, I don't think the personal and work-related challenges that young people face today are not very different from the challenges their parents and grandparents faced in the past."
11122,Prompt -  Should people be treated according to what they are capable of achieving instead of what they have actually done.,"""We don't reallk know what a person can so until he has done it"". In a performance oriented world however society treats one's past deeds as glimpses of the future. The ground braking figures in society, literature or science up until the present day have all been and continue to be fostered by valueing the potential over past achievements. Ċ The man who lead the world to rediscover non-violence and peace in fact had not always been an achiever. Starting out as an amatuer barrister in South Africa, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was just another youngster in search of a secure livelihood. It was by chance that he decided to adopt the cause of equality, that too only upon his own humiliation. His beneficiaries: victims of aparthied, restrained from judging the novice and bolstered his attempts to gain liberty after seeing hints of his potential from the oppressive regime. Had they rejected him for the lack of past achievements, India wouldn't be the republic it is today. Ċ In the world famous play"" Les Miserables"" the sagacious Bishop discerns Jean Vilejeous chances of becoming a better man, while at the Bishop's house in a bid to escape fromt he police. Jean shows remorse for the sin he had committed in the past. Having faith in his own judgement, the wise Bishophelped the convict run away to Paris, so he could turn over a new leaf there. Ċ If the examples of Gandhi and the Bishop are too high in stature to connect with, an example from my experiences at my music school might perhaps be more convincing. Every student ranging from the senior most tenor voice to the meek soprano is treated well irrespective of their credits and awards. IMportance is given to those students however who show immense dedication to the art. Ċ Though past deeds or lack there of may project a precarious future the spark in the fireplace foretells how big the flames may be."
11123,TOPIC:-  Some people believe the government should spend money on sport training for top players. While some people believe they should spend money on sports training for everyone. Discuss both the views and give your opinion. funds for a few sport stars or for every athete,"Sports play a major role in the overall growth and development of the individuals. Nowadays, a major chunk of the overall budget is allocated to the sports training. Some people think that the government should invest their funds in providing the sports training to their top players. However, there are a few who feel that the government funds should be utilized for imparting physical health education to the commoners. Ċ Some believe that the government should focus on all the individuals as compared to the top players, which are significantly lower in proportion. By utilizing the government funds in imparting sports training to all the individuals will make them fit and healthy and reduce the frequency of several hazardous diseases caused due to limited physical movement. Nowadays, people are leading a sedentary lifestyle, these physical health education sessions will encourage them to pursue a healthy living. This would further boost the overall economy of the country. Ċ However, there are a few who believe that the government should spend the money on providing fitness training to the elite players as compared to the entire nation. They feel these champions are the biggest asset of the country. As they bring pride and glory to the nation. By spending the government funds in providing them advanced and specialized sports training will further enhance their skills. As a result, while participating in a tournament, they will be more competitive and would have an edge over other participants. Ċ In my opinion, the government should follow a balanced approach in distributing the funds to provide sports education to the commoners and top players. As both these sections are equally important for the overall growth and success of the nation."
11124,"Topic: discuss the reasons that make a person, especially a teenager start using drugs and lead to addiction.","One of the most urgent problems of modern times is teenagers using drugs, which goes so far as to addiction. It is a multi dimensional problem and experts search for its various reasons among which are emotional pressures and group acceptancance. Ċ With the difficulties brought about by the modern world, along with the adults, youngs began to have hard times. Because of the expectations of parents, abundance of exams and the decrease of communication between peers with the advance of technological devices, pressure on teens is increasing day by day. This situation leads them to express themselves by doing something extreme and harmful like using drugs. With the help of using drugs, they can get rid of these emotional pressures such as anger, stress and depression, and forget everything and relax. Ċ Besides, group acceptance is not commonly known but one of major reasons of using a drug. Considering that a teenager, who feels lonely and confused, wants to be a part of a group of his peers and if there is just one condition which is using a drug, it would be inevitable for him to do that. Also, there is another situation of group acceptance, for example, a guy may not like or want to use drugs but he may want to be part of the group of guys who fel depressive like him, soo he might imitate them and use drugs. Ċ Over all, for a problem that has such a scape there can be inevitably many reasons ,and emotional pressures and group acceptance seem to be the widely recognized ones. Using drug is a critical and vital issue which needs a solution urgently and it is the responsibility of all people."
11125,"When people need to complain about a product or poor service, some prefer to complain in writing and others prefer to complain in person. Which way do you prefer?Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.","In the contemporary world, the usage of corporate services and products is increasingly popular. Sometimes these many not satisfy individuals experience, where some people think to report it through a mail or a letter and others prefer to complain to management in person. I believe that the former would be efficient and practical , this essay explains the reasons with proper examples. Ċ The easiest way to send the feedback to an organization would be letter writing. Since everyone has access to technology, sending complaint emails is a piece of cake , which is mentioned on the products. Indeed, to acknowledge the unsatisfactory on gaint company products is laborious, as offices might be in different states. However, in this ,case feedback can be sent on a post, unless they won't provide a mail address. For instance, if one felt unhappy with a biscuit packet that cost five dollars, then it is not value for money to go to an office and report the complaint rather than text them a message. Ċ Also, it makes organizations pursuit easy to have followed up on unsatisfied service. Having a word with workers about the product defect, which they forget or not acknowledge to higher authorities; So, the paper-based complaint may help them to track and enhance the quality of service. Moreover, they can update the customers by reverting to the same mails. A good example is reporting glitches in google, whenever a bug is reported that would be escalated to the manager who is responsible to tag the issue with the concerned team. Thus, paper reporting helps to acknowledge the problem to the proper person. Ċ To summarize, I believe that written feedback would be effortless and help the organization to track the issue and take appropriate action."
11126,"Children in some part of the world have less responsibility compared to children in the past. Some people think this is as a positive change, however others think of it as a negative change. Difference in requirements for children","In the past, children have several responsibilities to do, they do not only focus to study but also they must help their parents to earn money in order to fulfill their necessity. In contrast, children today do not have responsibility as much as they did in the past. In my point of view, this is a positive change as children will focuse to only study in their childhood. Ċ Ideally, children have responsibility to build up their knowledge when they were children. This is because they have to looking for their own self, in particular their strength and and weakness. By reducing responsibility, it will provide a wide time for them for finding their own interest and talent to improve in the next time. I will be emphasize that study is not just about learn in cognitive way, but also in psycomotoric and afective aspect too. Ċ Another reason regarding this, is relating the fact that reduction of children activity indicates that their parents have done their own responsibility for covering the necessary of their family in all aspect, either on financial, or social aspect. As such, It is true that this condition is a positive change for children. Ċ Taking everything into consideration, less responsibility of children can make student focuse to their study because they did not have any distrubtion to ignore their lesson. This also appears the fact that parent has done their job in a proper way. Moreover, student just use this chance to benefit their self by ensuring that they are realy study in the whole of time provided."
11127,Many people patronize larger industries and ignore local shops because the big firms invest a lot into promotion and marketing. What can this cause to the local shops? What can be done to make people patronize the local shops?,"Nowadays, due to the effects of globalization, many companies tend to open their showroom across the globe. This has led to the majority of people think that bigger industries are better than local shops, because the big companies put their efforts in promoting and marketing. This has an impact on local shops and there are certain steps that can be implemented to make people patronize the local companies. Ċ To commence with, as big industries are expanding aggressively, they invest in promoting their goods, which has caused local shops their business. For example, companies in food and fashion industry has a tremendous impact on the buyer. Companies like MC Donalds have created adverts for younger children, which has caused 70% of the business to the local shops. In addition to the business impact, these big firms are also able to change the mindset of the people, that these products are localSuggestionlocally and not that durable. Ċ Educating people and making them aware about the benefits of local shops is the first step to patronize local shops. Secondly, educating people about the marketing gimmick and what impact does it has on the society and the country overall. For instance, a country like China has been successful in inculcating these values in their citizens. Because of this the country has been able to grow drastically. Moreover, government can give some benefits to the business to start manufacturing in-house. Due to this benefit, there will be more number of people who can open their local shops and succeed. Ċ In conclusion, although, big companies with marketing strategies are able to lure the customers, there are some countries which are able to manufacture products in-house. With the help of government and local leaders there are ways to help these local shops grow and prosper. This eventually brings prosperity back to the country."
11128,Some people think that teenagers should follow the example of older people. Others think that it is natural for teenagers to challenge what older people say. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"A highly controversial issue relates to whether elderly people should be listened by youngers or if it is common that their experience is not applicable for younger lives. In this essay, I will examine both points of view and explain why the arguments for accepting elderly advice are stronger. Ċ It is commonly believed that the elderly's experience should be used as a model by youths. The main reason for believing that is because they have the knowledge acquired through decades of life experience. Furthermore, they are a way mature, which allow them to know how to deal with drawbacks in life. Therefore, they are able to help teenagers avoid committing mistakes on their own. To illustrate, they already faced some challenging times that called for resilience such as war or economic crises that most parts of youngers nowadays will never have do deal with. Ċ On the other hand, some people claim that older's experience is not important for teenagers nowadays. This is mainly because youngers must to known how to deal with their own flaws, which can be used as an effective method for teenagers to flourish themselves. Thus, the world has extremely changed in the last decades, which turns older's concerns obsolete due to the new society's trends. For instance, having a family was the most important factor to be considered as a happy person for the ageing people, unlike nowadays which people rule out families and try to achieve the professional success that will make them cheerful. Ċ In conclusion, both arguments have their merits. On balance, however, I believe that the younger should definitely learn with their older ones in order to avoid mistakes that their parents or grandparents did in the past and also to help them to evaluate."
11129,"Here is the topic People have different job expectations for jobs. Some people prefer to do the same job for same company, while others prefer to change jobs frequently. Discuss both these view and give your own opinion. Here is my answer: reasons for changing work places","Many workers change jobs frequently in these days and they think that changing jobs leads to more opportunities. Meanwhile, the other people believe that staying in the same jobs is a better choice. Ċ One of the benefits of staying in one job increases the job security because changing jobs always means losing the stable income or moving house. To stay in one job is also means that you can avoid these problems. Another benefit to not changing job is that you can gain more experience and also increase your salary. The company may increase the salary as a reward or even give the promotion. On the other hand, those people who often change jobs may do not have enough experience to get the same salary compared to the people who stay in the same job for a long time. Ċ However, there are also have some benefit of changing jobs. One of the benefits is that worker can learn more skill because working in the different company also means that learning more different kind of skills. Meanwhile, to change jobs can also bring some new challenge compared to not change the job, because new things can always enhance the people's motivation and keep the job flash. The last advantage is these kinds of people are seems as more confident and well-rounded because of facing the new things or learning the new skill. Ċ In my opinion, to change jobs once in a while it means more benefit and is also a way to keep the life flash, and it is also another opportunities to challenge myself and learn more skill through the job."
11130,crimes in the media Topic: Some people suggest that there should be restrictions on a detailed description of crimes in the newspapers and on television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent years, the question of whether or not officers should control the detailed description of crimes in the media has sparked a controversy. Although individuals have right to know what happened specifically, the details of offence should not be entirely public in the newspapers and on TV. Ċ Several reasons can be cited to explain why the information of crimes should be limited on the Internet. First, if polices made the details of crimes public, offenders and would-be ones could become more subtle in committing crimes. In fact, by gaining unlimited access to detailed description of previous crimes, they are able to apprehend process to work cases of polices and offend more perfectly, which creates difficulties for polices to solve down the road. Another reason is by revealing the details of offence, these articles can trigger victim's and their family's torment, which implies the information should be limited in the media as a way to protect them. This means that journalists and reporters will contact victims so as to exploit information, which makes them irritated and wretched when remembering again. Ċ The restrictions on a detailed description of crimes, particularly serious ones, on the Internet is reinforced by more supporting evidence below. Firstly, if whole information was revealed, this could shock many people, especially young children. For example, horrible sense of the blood and violent images will cause obsession to kids who are vulnerable in a long term, which implies this limitation is imperative. Secondly, in order to boost ratings, many newsrooms spare no expense in drawing public attention through currently hot crimes. This means that they can provide inaccurate information and exaggeration, which shows insensitivity and cause irritation among the masses. Ċ In conclusion, the description of crimes in the media should be strictly controlled. By considering the pros and cons of this suggestion, people can make best decisions for themselves."
11131,Topic:-People prefer to use their own transport nowadays. What could society do to encourage people to use public transport?,"Utilization of private transportation is one of the major problems that the world is facing today. If immediate and consequences and measures are not taken to tackle this problem, the consequences would be unimaginable. However, in order to find right remedies firstly, the real reasons must be unearthed. Ċ There are several factors responsible for great usage of private transportation. The most important reason for this problem is, it is becoming like a passion. Mostly youngsters use their own vehicles to showoff. In the same vein, travel on private transportation is largely attributed to avoid the environmental effects. To escape from the sun powerful rays and the acid rains, People are using their own transportation to reach their exact destination. Daily, lacks of vehicles are bought by the people in the world. Ċ But how can this problem be countered? Firstly, I firmly believe that, government should increase the public transportation. Why because people may not have time to wait for the government vehicles. And also, People can travel by having a seat. On the same lines, it is strongly recommended that government should hike the petrol and diesel prices, and also reduce the prices of public transportation. By this, utilization of private vehicles will decrease and prefer public transportation. Ċ Unless concerted and war-footed efforts are made to address the malady of surge in private vehicles use, there will be more traffic jams and burgeon of global warming."
11132,Some people believe that employment over the age of 60 is not right and creates lots of problems. So people should retire after 60 and not work. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"A popular belief is that employers who is over 60 years old is not inappropriate for the job and they make several mistakes in their workplace. Repercussions, authority should not be working with them and should be given evacuation. I totally agree with this statement. This essay will explore the positive and negative aspects of retiring at sixty years. Ċ On the one hand, there are certain advantages to retire at 60 years.Life is more important than job, leading a healthy life is also crucial. For example, the stress at endeavour can impact your physical and mental well being. The risks of diseases such as heart attack, and diabetes are quite high over fifty years and if one continues to task, it might be detrimental to their health. By getting retired people will not face this health problem. In addition, production stress can be compulsory them to make any mistakes because they will not have sufficient knowledge about advance technology and they will not be able to increase their knowledge as technology due to overage. For instance, one of my uncles work a private bank and he is in the mid sixties and he can’t do any technological work because he has no enough knowledge about it. The authority should have retired him. For this reason over 60 ages is not accurate to do any job, the government should bestow retire those types workers. Ċ On the other hand, there is a multitude of negative sites to retire at sixty ages. If government retire them, government will face financial problems due to a large amount of money have to pay pullout parson. To put it another way, retire person feels more isolated and socially inactive due to they do not effort anything and they always set home so they feel dull. A good illustration of this is Bangladesh don’t give retirement at sixty ages for removing financial crisis. Another disadvantage is that if bureaucrats provide withdrawal at 60s ages, they will not get better suggestions from elderly people. That’s why a common opinion is that authority should not give evacuation at sixty ages. Ċ In conclusion, this essay discussed good and bad sites about retirement for sixty ages. I completely agree with this statement because it is beneficial for employers and authorities."
11133,Childhood obesity has become a serious problem in recent years. Ċ What are the primary causes of this? Ċ What measures should be taken to reduce childhood obesity?,"Children obesity has become a worrying topic in recent years. There are several reasons leading to this. Ċ There are a number of reasons for the rising levels of childhood obesity. First, since the eating habits of today’s children are more unhealthy than that of previous generations, they tend to consume too much fast food, candy, and sugary drinks. In fact, these foods are very high in fat and sugars, but low in vitamins and minerals, which can cause kids to gain weight quickly. Second, by having sedentary lifestyles, modern kids tend to watch TV, browse the internet or play computer games instead of playing outside or doing sport. As a consequence, they are becoming increasingly obese. Ċ There are several actions that could be taken to mitigate the problem mentioned above. Firstly, in order to ensure children have a healthy diet, parents are required to choose the daily foodstuffs carefully. For example, they should favour organic foods, like clean fruits, vegetables or meats, over-processed foods, which leads to a fit body for their kids. Secondly, if parents restrict the time their children spend on sedentary activities and encourage them to take regular exercise, they would help their kids have more chances to do sports and other social activities. This means that by burning excess calories that otherwise would be stored as fat, these physical activities would help them control their weight. Ċ In conclusion, there are various factors leading to the increase in child obesity and measures should be implemented to tackle this issue."
11134,Topic: It is more important for schoolchildren to learn about local history than world history. To what extent do you agree or disagree ? (about 300 words) native and world history education,"It is argued that national history plays a more vital role than other countries' history and therefore students should focus on their native history. As far as I am concerned, while local history lessons are crucial to children's development, world history could also benefit them a lot. Ċ There are many reasons why children are made to learn their national history. Firstly, teenagers can understand their indigenous history carefully such as significant historical events and famous heroes who protected their countries, which helps them adjust their behavior to fit the society they live in. For example, by learning native history, schoolchildren will respect their ancestors as well as express their gratitude toward their parents and grandparents. Another reason why national history is mandatory in schools is young generations can draw lessons from the process of protecting and constructing their countries of their ancestors. Using this knowledge, youngsters can deter their nations from making similar mistakes in the past and also make their countries prosper by experience collected from the past. Ċ On the other hand, young people can also gain many benefits from learning world history. It is an inevitable fact that by studying history, learners can acquire more knowledge about other nations in various aspects. Due to the close relation between history and indigenous cultures, teenagers can have a deeper insight into customs and traditions of other areas. As a result, a deep understanding of historical situations and cultures can prevent students from offending local values when travelling to other nations. Furthermore, studying world history can provide young people with experience to develop their countries. For example, the underdeveloped nations can imitate other prosperous countries such as following their educational curriculum or strategies to make their own nations flourish in an effective way. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that native history and world history should be taught all over the world because they are of the same importance."
11135,"Learning english at school is often seen as more important than learning local languages. If these are not taught, many are at a risk of dying out.  In your opinion is it important for everyone to learn English? Should we try to ensure the survival of local languages, and if so, how?","Nowadays, English is being taught as a first language in many schools in favour of the regional languages. Some fear that if these are not given equal representation in the curriculum, they might be forgotten entirely. I am of the opinion that an attempt to protect regional languages should be made in these communities. Ċ First off, I feel that any indigenous language in a particular region must be included in the coursework of every grade. In addition to that schools must conduct daily readings of the news in the morning assembly by the students in that language. This can be extended to yearly events that promote the literature or cultural background that comes with these local languages. The same can be done by non-academic institutions as well. This should inspire interest among students in finding out more about their community. Ċ Moreover, there are many endangered languages currently in the world, and a large number of ancient languages that we can barely decipher anymore. For example, the Persian language of one of the largest ancient empires is completely forgotten today. That said, we have also lost the ability to translate their texts accurately. Which leads to gaps in our knowledge of their society. Ideas and concepts that we could instead learn from are now shrouded in obscurity. Ċ Finally, English is certainly an important language to learn simply due to its global influence on science, commerce and academia. By no means does that indicate that we must allow a local language to fizzle out of existence especially when we can prevent it."
11136,"Nowadays, many people have to work longer time, and they feel more stressful than before. What are the reasons? What can employers do to make their life easier?","In modern times, the issue of stress in today’s workplace has become highly controversial. It is nerve-wracking for the people who need to work for longer hours. Before offering any solution, it is important to discuss the root causes of the problem. Ċ To begin with, there are a plethora of causes of stress in the workplace. Firstly, this is due to excessive workloads with unrealistic deadlines resulting in anxiety among the workers. Added to this is the bullying or harassment by management for which staff member feel undervalued and it affects their self-esteem. For instance, a survey by Google revealed that 72% of employees who are criticized often become stressful and feel demotivated to do the job. Ċ Turning to possible solutions, perhaps the immediate step would be to reduce people’s workload. This could be done by ensuring that the workers are offered realistic tasks with target-related payments so that they feel encouraged to complete that task. A potential remedy for the ongoing torment of management may be to counsel and educate them to provide the employees with weekly performance reviews or appraisals in the meetings to motivate the workers. For example, a group of researchers studied and reported that employers who are counselled properly treat their employees with positivity and affection. Ċ To sum up, although people have stress due to work overloads and abuse, it can be overcome if the aforementioned solutions are adopted. In the future, employers will be taking precautions such as providing perks or financial rewards to the employees so that it results in job satisfaction."
11137,Some people believe that residents are responsible for the place where they live to be clean and tidy. Others believe that government is the responsible. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"A place where we live-in requires actions to taking care of it. Some people think that the cleanness is the owner's duty, whereas others are willing to put the responsibility on the government. In this essay, I will discuss both view and state my opinion as a conclusion. Ċ Some people think that the responsibilities of the government include cleaning peoples's neighbourhood. The nation needs to provide either money as a maintenance spending or workers to clean all residential places around the country. For example, the state could hire one person for each neighbourhood to do cleaning service. As a matter of fact, the country has numerous number of workers to handle the cleanness of public infrastructures, yet not for personal assets. It is done due to the comfort of people while using the public infrastructures. Furthermore, the budget for it is huge as well as the budget for other essential services provided by the nation. That is why spending for personal matters is not a priority. Ċ For some other people, they do the maintenance of their house as they are the owner who understand that every activity regarding their possession is their responsibility. Moreover, citizens could do anything it takes to make their places comfortable for them to live-in. For instance, a person who has an artistic skill will treat their assets with a lot of abstract features. Conversely, farmers will plant fruits or vegetables around their property. Therefore, having a private place gives us freedom to use it as we want to. Regarding that matters, if there are activities that potentially harm the others, then the state will take an intervention. Ċ In conclusion, I convince that it is the owner's responsibility to keep their places clean, tidy, and treat it as they want. Having said that, it is the nation's job to protect the residents from disturbing each other."
11138,"‘Because so much information is available on the internet today, traditional secondary schools and teachers are no longer necessary.’ Do you agree with this statement?","Nowadays anyone can get information about anyone or anything online. Since the abundance of data available on the web, many people say that secondary schools and teachers are of less importance. I completely disagree with this and think schools and teachers are extremely necessary and play an important role in a students growth. Ċ On the one hand, I believe that attending school and learning from experienced people such as lecturers is the building foundation of a child's growth. In other words, when a child goes to a school, he meets different children and tends to learn from them and also involves various completions which they can not learn from the internet. Furthermore, reading information from the web can not make you understand it. For instance, you can copy a solution of maths equation from the websites but you could not understand the method to solve it. Hence schools and teachers are important. Ċ On the other hand, there can be several drawbacks of just reading information on the internet. Firstly, authenticity is the major concern of the data on the internet. Anyone can publish their thoughts on the web and there is no check on it. Secondly, being introvert is another aspect of not going to an academy. For example, one can gather as much material from the website and learn them but you have to be able to talk to people. But not going schools at an early age can make to an introvert. Ċ To conclude, I strongly believe that schools and teachers are important because it gives them the right knowledge and confidence to speak in public. Moreover, if a child skips school, it can affect their speaking abilities and lower their self-belief."
11139,"With growing populations in cities, more and more people live in homes with little or no outdoor space. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?","Due to the ever-increasing population, many people today, not by choice, reside in apartments with no place for recreational activities. In my opinion, it is vital to have sufficient space for families. Ċ Firstly, the expansion of urban areas has led to deforestation and loss of farmlands, and to reduce the impact on farms and forests, humans have resorted to living in flats. A concept wherein an area is allotted to an individual within tall buildings. The carpet area is just enough to construct a living room, a kitchen, and one or two bedrooms with no room for anything else. In addition, it leads to nuclear families, which has its consequences. Connection with individuals in one's life is lost, causing seclusion and isolation. For instance, it can no longer be witnessed that one entire family comprising of different generations is living under one single roof. Ċ Secondly, these days youngsters do not have access to any playgrounds where they can enjoy playing sports with other children of their age. They tend to lose out on their precious time by staying inside the house, not socializing and spending time with their peers but instead forced to stay indoors and in front of the screen. With no physical activity, the impact is seen on the health of the youth as one tends to gain weight and become lazy in nature resulting in various health issues. For example, the youth these days spend the majority of their time playing computer games and not playing any sport. Ċ In conclusion, apartments and flats could be a possible solution to save the environment, but it has a downside. Populaces living in such places have health-related problems to deal with, be it physical or psychological, as fewer space results in lesser physical activities and social interactions even though humans are inherent to be social animals."
11140,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.,"In the past,people prefer reading books in the free time,it's a kind of enjoyable entertainment,however,according to the progress in society,people are attracted by the high definition motion pictures,which quality is much better than ever.Nonetheless,I would prefer reading books. Ċ Apparently,watching movie is an interesting diversion,which being shared with friends,it's the important factor of watching movies,additionally,such as those hazard and saga movies which bring us the visual stimulus.Vivid spectacle,clear picture,famed movie stars,these are the attractive factor to bring us into the world of movies.Did you find out the movies of ""Harry Porter""is famed by the movies instead of it's novel. Ċ How about reading books? is it really tedious of reading the whole book than watching movies? actually,I don't think so.I believe most of students are poor to write a coherent essay even a complete paragraph,that's why I suggest you to read the novel,in that,you will learn how the author put the words and words together naturally,how they imagine and describe something they have not even experienced.Reading books can also improve our reading skill and writing skill at the same time,besides,it's a good chance to know some rare words that we have never heard. Ċ Last but not least,The obvious difference between watching movies and reading books is that we are being able to visualize and imagine the spectacle and ambience in the bookas by reading,throught reading,you may vicariously experience the story in the books such as you are actually there,this is the most attractive part of reading books. Ċ I like watching movies as well,but I always believe that reading books will be more intesting than you have though if you truly enjoy it."
11141,Many companies offer their employees the opportunity to work from home. Ċ Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working from home for the company. Ċ And give your own opinion,"Currently, with this pandemic ,situationAdd an article the situation a situationThe noun phrase situation seems to be missing a determiner before it. Consider adding an article. Ċ show examples we are living in, several institutions had to rethink the way to get their job done. The home office seemed to be the only choice to control this rampant disease and continue working. There are upsides and downsides to it, however, I tend to believe is more advantageous to work from home as it is more affordable to everyone. Ċ On the one hand, the obvious argument in favour is the time consumed to get ready and commute to work. Take a physically impaired person as an example. They need more time to prepare themselves for work, like, showering, having breakfast, get in the car or public transport, all of these are time-consuming. Furthermore, you can save money from transportation fees or maintenance in case you have a car. Therefore, working from the comfort of their homes seems more appropriate. Ċ On the other hand, making your house a workplace can be challenging if you have children or pets. For instance, children can interrupt you because they are hungry, or have injured themselves, moreover, pets can easily distract you and make you lose the track of your work. Additionally, you will need proper equipment and use your own utilities during your time. Thus, the downsides of a home office are the distractions, interruptions and kind of costly. Ċ In conclusion, the positive side outweighs the negative. I believe that every job which can be done from home should be that way, as it is more affordable to everyone and can be a life-changer for people with movement restrictions."
11142,"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. going after our goals continually","Our goals are what defines us through life. As a result, I agree with the statement ""Never, never give up"" that translated as we should never stop pursuing our goals through hard working. Working hard to reach our goal reveals our true identity as a hardworking person and how strong we are to reach our goals. Ċ Showing passion and endurance in our journey to reach our goals identify us as a hard working person. As a result, we can be proud of ourselves. For example, an athlete who practices months or even years to win a one-time competition defines himself as the best athlete in his field. He can claim himself a winner and show us this feature in reality. Additionally, not being tired illustrates that we value our goals which is an acclaimed personality. Therefore, people will respect us more and consider us a reliable person. Ċ At times, achieving a goal can be cumbersome. By trying hard and remaining on the track to reach our goals we can show how strong person we are. Researchers, for instance, spent many years to find out reasons behind some natural phenomenon. They do several field experiments and field observations until they could solve mysteries of life. Spending such a long time to understand reasons reveals that they are a strong person. Another good example would be Paralympic games athletes who despite their physical restrictions overcome their difficulties and stand on the winner's side in the competition. Ċ In brief, going after our goals continually is one thing that I have been agreeing to it all my life. It not only shows our passion and value for our goals but proves what a strong person we are. This is a trait that every individual should acquire it."
11143,It's generally agreed that the amount of rubbish created by humans today is a worldwide problem. What do you think are the main causes of this situation? What measures can be used to tackle the problem,"It is known that the vast amount of litter produced by mankind is considered to be the main cause of the climate woes, degeneration of maritime zones and environment. Many scientists are concerned how to cope with this problem reducing the number of refuse, albeit, very few of us are inclined to spare a thought to the causes of our actions. Ċ From the point of my view, the majority of rubbish such as bottles and other non-biodegradable materials created by humankind can be seen on the surface of the oceans and seas. Virtually all of the rubbish is released owing to the human consumption, and most of them are non-biodegradable therefore man has no choice but to throw away them into the oceans, however, apart from degenerating the ocean, they debilitate the stability of the marine biodiversity that might be served as a dish to us. Ċ Nevertheless, professional approach when dealing with this issue is remarkably noteworthy in terms of human healthcare and stability of our ""blue planet"". It is crucial to reduce or avoid incorruptible materials when making products available to the public. Furthermore, paying attention when transporting fossil fuels overseas is also important since acidic substances are considered to be lethal. Ċ In conclusion, if we do our best in every action we do in terms of proficiency, the nature will take care of itself. In addition, we are supposed to recycle the unnecessary wastes, only in these ways, will there be not any ripple effects."
11144,Men do most of the high-level jobs. Should the government encourage a certain percentage of these jobs to be reserved for women? What is your opinion on that? Use your own knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.,"Discrimination of gender equalities are an ongoing process since the beginning of life. Regarding this ,issue government can play a vital role to keep balance. In my point of view, there are should keep some high paid salaries for qualified women. Following , an essay I will describe some of my knowledge and the arguments with the above topics. Ċ In spite of biological ,facts women are never behind men. Women have more qualities than men to keep a balance between work and family life. For ,instance motherhood is the most precious thing which female-only can feel. According to current surveys, it is proven that females can do any kind of job including the most highly qualified job besides man even after becoming mothers. Take as an example profession like a doctor, both gender has abilities to be the best doctor. Moreover, female patients feel more comfortable with women to discuss their issues. Therefore, governments should reserve certain vacancies for women. Ċ On the other hand, another reason to support my arguments is that the government should not underestimate the quality basis of gender. The country's population consist of together both men and women. If both genders are unable to contribute to the nation well being then the country itself will lose the value of its own. For instance, nowadays females also can work in NASA. Eailer no one even thinks of that female could able to that. There are more no of increasing the participation of different kinds of job both gender. I think its a matter of consideration Ċ To sum up, to right uses and developments for nations government should take measure for keeping the proper amount of reservation for women."
11145,Many educators believe that it should be mandatory for all students to wear uniforms. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is true that more and more teachers think that wearing uniforms at educational establishments ought to be obligatory for all pupils. This essay completely agrees that making students wear the same uniforms brings a sense of unity and enables learners to focus on their studies. Ċ The key aspect of adopting a uniform in a school or college is equality that makes pupils look the same despite their social status. It is undeniable that if students are allowed to wear what they want, they tend to show-off themselves by having different trendy outfits on which might cause discrimination among students. For instance, the last survey conducted by Oxford revealed that more teenagers try to wear fashionable clothes to keep up with their peers. Therefore, schools must maintain the discipline of dress code among students, which makes students feel much better as their classmates. Ċ Another major factor why I completely agree with this view is that school outfits help schoolchildren concentrate on their studies instead of wasting their worthy time on choosing diverse clothes. It must be stated that more pupils spend too much time on what to wear, especially many girls as they follow the latest trends like their mothers. This can cause a lack of attention to their studies. For example, recent research held by Cambridge University showed that there are more high-achieving boys than girls at schools on average. Thus, it is better to have a uniform among students. Ċ In conclusion, there is an increasing number of teachers who would think that mandatory school uniforms is necessary, and I believe that it is a must since school outfits enable every student to have a sense of community and make them achieve their educational goals without distraction."
11146,People in the community can buy cheaper products nowadays. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages? industrialization makes products cheaper,"It is obvious that consumers can buy products with lower price in this time and age thanks to the industrialization. While I accept that there are some drawbacks, I think that these are outweighed by the benefits. Ċ On the one hand, there are certainly some problems associated with buying cheaper products. It is clear that customers should take the quality of products into consideration. As a company have to balance the proportion of capital and profit they make, to manufacture low-priced products, they may used materials that are not guaranteed. If people use that kind of product in a long term, undoubtedly, they may suffer from some health problems such as cancer. Besides, along with the mass production, there will be more wastes and emissions disposed, which obviously exacerbate the environment pollution. Ċ On the other hand, I believe that the advantages will not be overshadowed by those drawbacks.The greatest advantage can be seen when people are provided cheaper products is that they could save a great deal of money spent on daily expenses and thus, they invest that saving amount on other important aspects such as education or housing. In addition, it is particularly favorable for low-income families as they will have a wide range of options to improve their living standards. Ċ Another benefit is that there will be a rising demand for purchasing commodities due to the fall of price. As a result, the more expenditure people spend, the faster the national economy grows. Not only are manufacturers beneficial but also other parts of a supply chain take advantage of this phenomenon. Ċ To sum up, it seems to me that the advantages for consumers and the economy of buying cheaper products these days have more than compensated for the downsides"
11147,Some people think that trial marriage is currently a positive trend for youngsters in order that they know each other better before marriage. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, the rate of divorce surges to a great extend, and one of the reasons is, the life partners do not know each other properly or any of them is not able to satisfy physically, which make people think about that engaging in cohabitation is good or bad before the marriage. I partially agree with the above notion and the reasons for my inclination are articulated in the following paragraph. Ċ To commence with, the pre-married situations are a good to create a strong base to the relationship and there are many advantages of it. Firstly, both the partners can know each others good and bad habits and after knowing that, they can decide to marry. Secondly, they can easily identify the future skills or responsibilities require to be part of the family, which diminish the number disputes in the later life. Lastly, it provides a better mental health. For example, singles and divorced people are mentally disturbed; while happily married or pre-married couples are more satisfied with their life. Ċ On the flip side, the live in relationships is having many dangers, and one of them is the pregnancy, as the couple is not fully financially independent. Moreover, the only option for them is abortion, which is perilous for the health of a mother in the long run. Furthermore, if they decide to give birth, the child is not legal because parents are not officially married.In addition to that, pregnancy may become the reason for the divorce if any one of the partners is playing with another. For instance, if they give birth to child without planning, it might turn to the adverse conditions. Ċ To conclude, however cohabitation is advantageous as it not only provides the freedom to partners get familiar with each other, but also offers good mental health; it is having the major risk of becoming pregnant and immature parents, which negatively affect the growth of a child in the future."
11148,It would be better for them to be outside playing sports and taking part in more traditional pastimes than spending all day indoors. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"As technology is advancing in a rapid way, people are increasingly getting into the electronic entertainment world. The perspective of having more children following indoor activities rather than outdoors has to be discussed further. Ċ To start off with, children nowadays asks for computers or gadgets for their presents not a bike or a scooter. This is clear that kids are more interested in what best game to play or which console is perfect. Having children consuming their energy by sitting in front of a computer or on a sofa all day is not healthy at all. At a young age, they should not be left being lazy cause that will lead to health problems in their growing process. Ċ On the other hand, today one can find various outdoor activities that are good for children. Considering the large number of parks one can find nowadays, parents should take children to help them grow into physical activities and interaction with others. It is proven that communication skills between children of ages up to 5 years are better in those kids that play and communicate with other kids of same age. They learn how to share, how to talk and play with others that are not easily retrieved by staying inside playing on a computer. Ċ In conjunction to outdoor activities, any sort of sport is another subject that will help kids to be healthy and active. Swimming is a simple and inexpensive sport to introduce to children at an age of even 1 year old. It will increase the challenge, satisfaction and health in young children. Ċ To conclude, in my opinion, I think that teaching kids to be actively outside and limit the use of using electronic devices will help them balance between indoor and outdoor activities."
11149,"Question: If you could study a subject that you have never had the opportunity to study, what would you choose? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details.","Subject is area of knowledge studied in schools or boarders. If I would have opportunity to study a subject, I do not know yet. I think that I would choose to study religion more deep. I am very like about religion. I ever studied about it until bajuri book. However, I am interested to study more high again. Ċ I think it is very interesting to know knowledge about religion from bajuri, jannah, and om. It is book that give many knowledges about Islam law until root it. For example, it explains about married law. I think that every persons interested about it because each persons has wanted for getting married. However, some people have not many knowledges about responsibility establishing household. Ċ Another important for studying religion can know about cause of several matters that forbidden by Islam law such why we forbidden to eat pig and dog. I think that all forbidden there is because of it. That is all explained in om book. Hence, I am very curious about many becauses from forbidden. I want to know about it. Ċ In conclusion, I think that if time gave me self realization, it makes me to get more opportunities for reaching what I want. However, time never wait us. It always rotates on its axis. It makes us to forward because the world increasingly sophisticated. Therefore, we should study many skills that can compete with abroad."
11150,"Some people think that government should be responsible for crime prevention, while others believe it the responsibility of individual to protect themselves. Ċ Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","According to some in order to deal with violations in the world authorities should have to come forward,whereas, others opin that it is everyone's own duty to talk care of themselves. I personally partially agree with both viewpoints and I will elaborate on both these viewpoints in the upcoming paragraphs. Ċ On one hand, the state is the main strength of any country as they make laws for the betterment of their citizens. If government make strict rules and punishments for the criminal and set an example so that the other Violent people learn something from that punishment and will later on not try to do the same crime then this problem can be resolved to a large extent.For example, Paris is the country where the rules are very strict for criminals, as a result,the crime rate over there is almost negligible. Ċ On the other hand, other people believe that everyone should have to be aware of their protection. As cops or other guards can't be around everyone all the time.There are some situations where folks have to work smartly to protect themselves. For example, the masses should have to learn some basic safety tricks and tricks to protect their own to become a victim of any crime and for this teachers, parents should have to teach their kids since from their childhood about their safety. Ċ In conclusion, although the government can take some necessary steps against the prevention of crimes, yet I personally believe that this situation can be resolved with the collaborative effort of the government, individuals and society on the whole."
11151,You have just returned home from a holiday and have received photographs from a friend who was on holiday with you. Ċ Write to your frind thanking them for the photographs. You should include: Ċ -a description of the photos Ċ -the most memorable thing about the holiday Ċ -invite them to come and stay with you,"Hi Amy, Ċ How are you? I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to thank you for the photos and an unforgettable trip. Ċ I can not thank you enough for showing me your city and landmarks. Last week, I received the photos you've sent to me. Looking at the photos brings me so many happy memories of the time we spent together so vividly. I especially like the one we took in front of the zoo. I really enjoyed feeding koalas and kangaroos. That was such an amazing experience and I will never forget it. Australia is certainly a scenic country with remarkable landscapes and wildlife, particularly up in the north where you live. Ċ Next time, why don't you plan a holiday and stay with me in Japan next spring? The weather is great at that time of year and besides my husband and I will be celebrating our wedding anniversary. I could take you to see beautiful cherry blossoms and a famous castle. The scenery is spectacular. I'm sure you will love it. I'd be delighted if you could come and celebrate with us. Ċ Take care. And I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon."
11152,"Although more and more people are reading the news on the internet, most people still prefer reading the news in a newspaper. Ċ What are your views?","Since, the popularity of the Internet has been inclined, a plethora of masses prefers the news on it, whereas there are still some who choose a magazine for reading the news rather than the online articles. In my opinion, though the internet has brought several benefits, especially, broadcasting news in the online media, the journal is incredibly beneficial in order to improve mental capacity and learning habits. Ċ On the one hand, it is undeniable fact that the internet has revolutionized the way of reading news. This is because it is convenient to study the news articles at any location and time with the help of the Internet. In this contemporary era, people use various social networking sites such as Facebook and Instragram, where millions of the news on different topics are uploaded on a regular basis. For instance, a recent survey reveals that over thousands of the online articles can be published every day. Furthermore, it is inexpensive, so that it not only saves the person's money, but also saves time to visit to market for purchasing the books. Ċ On the flip side, the number of people continues to utilise the journal to keep updating about what is happening across the world in order to develop regular studying habits and foster the relationship. In other words, people are busy in their hectic employment and it becomes challenging to manage time for developing the creativity and knowledge through reading news. Similarly, this practice not only assists to develop intellectual ability, but also helps to alleviate stress and work burden. Moreover, the older generation would rather unfamiliar with latest technological advancement or never want to change their traditional way of reading the news. Hence, they still prefer to embrace the current news through the magazines. For example, my grandfather always reads a newspaper in the morning with colleagues. Consequently, it builds the strong relationship with them and enhances their knowledge as well. Ċ In conclusion, even though reading news on the Internet could be convenient and the cheapest, the newspaper would be the best choice for the elderly as well as in the far away places where internet facilities would inaccessible in order to strength relationships and improve the learning habits."
11153,Question: Private car ownership has grown grammatically in recent years. This has led to a rise in traffic congestion. What could governments and individuals do to reduce congestion?,"Growing car ownership has become a matter of great concern in the recent years. There are several effects caused by this adverse trend, one of them that interests quite a lot of government as well as people in society is traffic congestion. However, I believe, there are several measures to overcome this problem. Ċ In today's modern society, a person who own cars is not a considerable thing. Along with this, related issues can be anticipated. To tackle these problems, I think the most obvious solution would be that government could tax car at a high level. The advantage of this policy is that the one who would like to purchase a car will have to consider carefully before they spend a large amount of money on this. Ċ Another opinion is that government could make and ban enforces laws for these transport types. For example, we need to stipulate clearly that which streets the cars are or not allowed to run in. Besides, for the streets where the traffic jam is frequently take place, we might restrict an active time for these transports, especially, at rush hours. Ċ Furthermore, traffic congestion could be significantly declined if there are contributions from each individual in society. Besides seriously obeying the traffic laws, each person could reduce their dependence on cars, instead they can travel by the public transports such as buses, train, ect. Ċ In conclusion, various measures can be taken to combat the problems that are certain to arise as the ones who possess cars growing up quickly year after year."
11154,Most people accept that we now live in a globalized world but not everyone agrees that this is beneficial. To what extent is globalization a positive or negative development?,"Globalization is everywhere now and so, while some people approve of it, there are others who do not accept that it would be a benefit. There are a variety of positive developments, nevertheless, this does have some negative developments that need to be considered. Ċ Firstly, globalization has led to many futuristic developments and has a great impact on society. Furthermore, it had opened up to free trade and communication with other nations and thus, have improved technology, education, health care and consumer goods worldwide. For example, one of the most delicious products that have been enjoyed in everywhere, Nutella, which gets its ingredients from several countries. Ċ On the other hand, globalization had, unfortunately, led to homogenous cultures, which unfortunately made the unique cultures and languages of each distinct country extinct. For instance, Sri Lanka has many languages with the most prominent being Sinhalese and Tamil but there is a risk of more people speaking English and other languages in the future due to further studies and job opportunities abroad. Another drawback is that, it has also given rise to certain environmental issues. Due to the increased consumption and production of products. As follows, due to the rising demands of wood for doors and furniture of new houses built for people moving in from another country, could in turn lead to large areas of trees cut down and consequently, causing deforestation. Ċ In conclusion, living in a globalized world, has improved technological innovations, consumer goods, as well as, educational-wise, nonetheless, it could lead to homogenous cultures and many stressful environmental problems due to drastic production and consumption. Considering the above reasons, the negative movement appears to overrule the positive movement."
11155,"Some people think that in order to deal with the problem of congestion in cities, privately owned vehicles should be banned in city centers, while others consider this to be an unrealistic solution. Ċ Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","In recent decades, private vehicle ownership has boomed as car prices have started to go down, therefore allowing more individuals to purchase them. Some people believe that personal cars are the main reason city centres are congested, hence they should be prohibited, while others argue that this idea is impossible. My opinion is that city centres are too crowded and measures should be put in place to restrict access to personal vehicles. Ċ To begin with, many people think that an excellent solution for solving the overcrowding of town's centres would be to stop private automobiles from entering this area. That is because the air and noise pollution rates are really high, especially due to an enormous number of workplaces and business buildings. In other words, many employees live in the city’s outskirts and commute every day to the centre using their cars. Moreover, some city centres were built centuries ago and have small and narrow lanes, so traffic jams are more common here than in any other area. For instance, cities like Rome, London, or Paris have already introduced measures for banning private cars in order to stop traffic congestion. Ċ On the other hand, many individuals have the opinion that banning car owners to bring their cars into the city centre is an impossible solution due to a lot of difficulties citizens may face. One of the reasons is the fact that a lot of employees live in suburbs and a lot of them do not have public bus routes to use to go to work. Also, real estate is really expensive in city centres so some people cannot afford to buy or rent an apartment downtown. For instance, London rents are so expensive that people prefer to commute from nearby cities, like Winchester or Southampton, instead of renting a place there. However, these difficulties could be resolved if governments and councils introduced new bus services or lowered the high-speed railways' fees. Ċ To conclude, although many issues make banning privately owned vehicles a difficult measure, I believe that the authorities should create programs that would benefit both the commuters and the urban area’s infrastructure."
11156,Many processed foods and ready-made meals contain preservatives and additives . what are advantages to this? Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Since a few years ago, too many people are busier than before. For that reason, many companies around the world are developing options to cover the nutrient necessities. Those options of food include a lot of products to endure longer in the fridge. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of ready-made males and fast food consumption. Ċ On the one hand, ready to serve food is faster and cheaper. Since some people have longer labour journeys, they do not have time to cook. Then, buying this type of product is saving several hours to develop another activity. For example, some may prefer to go to the gym while others would choose to read a book. Also, several individuals never skip lunch because they always have something to eat. Otherwise, some would only eat chips or chocolates which are usually more expensive. Ċ On the other hand, good nourishment is not secure due to the chemicals contained in these products. For instance, while some individuals are allergic to some natural components, it is known that a small percentage of users could present an allergic response. Moreover, most companies are using too many plastic products to store and sell their products. It is causing environmental problems that would be worse in the future if people sustain the consumption of it. Ċ To conclude, definitely more and more workers, parents and, students are solving economic and time problems by using this kind of nutrition. In my view, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. However, responsible consumption is needed in order to diminish the increasing global warming."
11157,organising the olympics Holding Olympic Games is an exciting event. Some people think it has positive effects while others argue that it is a waste of money. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"That whether a country should host the Olympic Games has aroused a considerable controversy. While some people deem that it could bring enormous advantages, others assume that the nation would squander a substantial amount of money on it. In my opinion, I partly agree with the former statement. Ċ On the one hand, there are some justifications why a handful of people contend that being the host nation is a waste of money. This is because the country have to squander a host of money on constructing the state-of-the-art facilities for Olympic Games. If the national government is unable to compensate for its crushing financial loss, the country will be burdened with enormous debts. For example, in 2004, the starry-eyed government of Greek spent huge amount of money investing on up-to-date facility without considering its long-term use, resulting in its debt crisis for over two decades. Ċ On the other hand, it should not be forgotten that organizing Olympic Games could exert profound effects on the host nation's economy. It is because the country cost nothing to be its image to the world during the time the Olympic Games takes place. This led to the rapid development of tourism as well as other pieces of work relating to this special event. For instance, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona produced 88.7 percent of the city's decrease in unemployment. Ċ In conclusion, despite the fact that the country could suffer from financial damages, being the host of the Olympic Games would open up ample opportunities to stimulate its economic growth."
11158,Too much money is wasted on repairing old buildings that should be used to knock them down and build new ones. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays there have been so much money spent to repair old buildings. But I think instead of repairing them, they should be broken & new buildings should be built. Ċ There is a clear evidence that day by day so many buildings are turning into abandoned wastages in city areas which are causing harm to the environment of the places. Moreover, many people are living in those old buildings & that is risking their life severely. To keep them risk-free at a minimum rate, the building owners are somehow initiating some construction works to repair those buildings. But such a temporary step can never be a perfect solution to the main problem. As there is a chance that outworn buildings might face major collapses anytime without giving any pre-notice. That will lead to a massive accident. Ċ Such an issue can be solved by building new ones rather than repairing the old ones. The repairing process of old buildings will waste a lot of money & cause huge environmental pollution as well. Mostly that step won't bring in any positive outcome. On the other hand, new buildings can provide enough security to the people living there. Furthermore, that will turn into a permanent solution to the dwelling situation of many people. Money will be properly utilized in that process too. Additionally, there have been so many modern architectural innovations taken place in the modern world. The new buildings can get the touch of such innovation & become a significant piece of beauty. Ċ To summarize, repairing old buildings instead of building new ones doesn't look like a good idea at all. Therefore, I personally believe building new ones are a better approach than repairing the old ones."
11159,The average age for individuals to give birth is increasing. Some people think that it will have negative impact on family and country. What is your opinion about this?,"In this present era, pregnancy and deciding a baby has also become modern. In a few people's opinions, this will have an adverse effect on the family and society. However, in my point of view, it's totally the individual's decision to decide their child's delivery and it has no negative impact. The goals and passion towards their work may make the person decide it later. Also, the fear and the commitments they have to face after the birth of an infant can make people think upon pregnancy in a later point of their life. Ċ To begin with, every individual has a dream and running hard every day to achieve the same. Few people think that the kid's birth may ruin their life goals. For instance, when a woman gives childbirth and when she doesn't have much support from her family, subsequently she will be the one who gives up her job. Rather she would have a lot of personal and professional commitments to be fulfilled, which indeed would be collapsed due to the new responsibility. Consequently, it's good if a person fulfils their dream at least to some extent and plan their baby. Ċ Secondly, people are frightened to decide upon delivery as there will be many responsibilities after the delivery of the toddler from medicine to studies. Therefore, people are preferring to get settled financially rather getting committed into a family zone. For example, a person from a poor background cannot afford even the medicine and the post-vaccination charges offered by some private hospitals. Next comes the luxurious schools and studies, which fascinates both parents and students, but to get into such big schools cost a large amount of money. As a result, couples from this contemporary generation have become smarter and deciding their babies accordingly. Ċ In conclusion, the dream towards their work and the cost of living is making the individuals anxious to decide upon a kid. As highlighted earlier, it's a decision taken between a father and a mother and the society has nothing to do or comment in an individuals life. Hence, from the above statements, I claim that there is no negative impact on giving birth to a child after the average age."
11160,"Some educationalist argue that non-exam, art-based subjects such as music, drama, art and craft, should be compulsory in the secondary-school curriculum. They believe that activities such as these can improve overall academic performance. Art-Based Subjects and Student's Performance","Curriculum is the important aspect in educational system. Some educational experts believe that non-exam, art-based curriculum have to be applied in secondary schools because it can increase student's performance in the class. Others, however, believe that non-scientific subject such as music, drama, art, and craft only improve student's art skills. In this case, I strongly claim that art-based curriculum in secondary school is very useful in increasing student's useful skills and their academic performance. Ċ To begin with, the art-based subjects teach several vital skills for students such as confidence, team work and leadership. Firstly, art subject like singing, forces student to have good confidence. They must sing in front of others and show their voice. Secondly, taking drama as instance, pupils have to interact with each other to conduct a role well, so that it builds their social skill. After they involve in team work, their leadership skill is also gradually developed. So that, it is clear that pupil's skills are increased by art-based subject. Ċ Furthermore, the improving of their skills supports on their performance in learning. Art-based subject contain many activities which cover all student learning style; for example, Painting covers visual learning-style, kinesthetic style is covered by dancing, and singing can cover the student who is auditory. D' Potter, an educational expert launching his quantum teaching method in 2001, succeeded on improving student academic performance. His method developed by art method such as dancing before learning, using colour in remembering theory. Moreover, his experimented result showed that student motivation is improved by 80%. Ċ Taking everything into consideration, i totally agree that art-based subject more effectively in supporting student on getting optimal performance in school rather than scientific subject. Student predominant social skills will be improved and it is helpful for them in their future. In my view, teacher should apply learning method which cover student's learning style"
11161,"When cars and cyclists use the same roads, there are often problems. Ċ Why is this the case? Ċ What are the solutions?","Nowadays, the amount of transport is growing very quickly, while trail infrastructure is remaining to be as it was constructed in past times. The more variety of vehicles, the more difficulties appear, especially when such types as cars and bicycles are on the route simultaneously.The only decision to abolish this is expanding lanes and building new ones. Ċ The main reason for problems on the lane which car drivers and cyclists experience is that the major pathway was constructed many years ago when there were fewer participants. As a result, driveways are narrow and their capacity is not sufficient for the current circumstances. It creates dangerous situations and threatens the lives of drivers. For instance, the width of highways in many old cities does not allow a car and a bicycle to move next to each other, they should drive one in front of the other which creates traffic conjunctions and hazardous conditions on the roadway. Ċ To rectify this problem the governments should fund the building of new lane and improve transport infrastructure. Moreover, while designing new track schemes it is necessary to take into account all the types of vehicles that people use in their country. It means, the separated lines for cycling ought to be developed, as well as extra places for parking should be planned. For example, when the new bridge was built in Kyiv which connects two coasts of the city there were created a line for bicycles and places for leaving cars. It has noticeably improved the traffic and decreased the number of accidents. Ċ In conclusion, there is a peril for people who drive a car and bicycle in the same place of roads because there is too little space to not hamper each other. If the officials paid more attention and funded more money to reengineer existing roads, this problem would be solved and people could drive safely."
11162,"An increasing number of professionals, such as doctors and teachers, are leaving their own poorer countries to work in developed countries. What problems does this cause? What can be done to deal with this situation?","Country development depends upon how well professionals are growing and it is undeniable, that more and more health workers and educators are migrating to other countries and leaving their undeveloped provincial behind. This essay will discuss the two main causes and solutions in detail with examples based on that. Ċ To begin, moving abroad for work is popular among experienced workers because of unsatisfactory jobs such as low wages. To explain further, qualified people like doctors and teachers don't get paid that much in their native place because of the poor economy. For example, Doctors who get their degree in 5 years and spent another 1 year in training will receive a poor amount of money as their salary and no incentive will have low satisfaction as compared to foreign individuals who get handsome money for their skills. Moreover, fewer career opportunities in poorer parts of the world is another reason for migration. So to conclude, lack of money and decrease in career growth makes some people travel to different places. Ċ Despite, many reasons are there to leave undeveloped nations and migrate.These problems can be resolved by increasing salary. In addition , introducing good governmental schemes for skilled jobs like teaching and medicine which will result in financial growth. For instance, 60% of the nurses move to other countries because of their high salary packages and incentives along with good pension schemes. To sum up, drifting of polished employees could be reduced by making enhancing annual income and giving bonus all over the year. Ċ In conclusion, growth and learning is a part of human development and some folks get settled abroad for bread and butter especially, medical people and educations trainers leaving their own place because of low income and lack of future options which can be solved by increment and acknowledgement at the workplace. This will surely help in future development."
11163,Some people believe that elderly parents ought to live at senior homes. Other believe that they should 	live with family members. Do you agree or disagree?,"In the present age, there has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether elderly people should live with their families or at senior homes. Many persons argue that it is better for them to spend their days at the retirement homes, while others believe that old parents always should be with their children. Personally, I am in favour of the latter view and I feel this way because of two reasons which I explain in the following essay. Ċ To begin with, the primary reason we have to take into consideration is that old people have many valuable experiences that are really beneficial for young individuals to know them. Furthermore, grandparents are able to share their successes and failures and give important advice to the next generations. For instance, they can speak to their grandchildren about life in the past and also the challenges that they will face in the future.  Ċ The second reason that is worth pointing out is that parents spend many years to grow their children in a good condition so it is not fair to leave them in a retirement house when they need more caring and attention. Moreover, all individuals have a responsibility to looking after their old parents and do not hurt their feelings. For example, if persons have tried to make a big family and do many things for them during the years, they will expect to spend their difficult days within their family. Ċ To sum up, I would like to say that I strongly disagree with the statement that old individuals ought to live at senior places. The main factor that we have to take into consideration is that there are advantages both for parents and kids. In fact, if they live with family members, will not feel lonely and in addition, they can provide much useable advice for young generations."
11164,Some people think that the best way to increase road safety is to increase the minimum legal age for driving cars and riding motorbikes. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the present day, the security of roads and streets has been a substantial problem of public security. Governments have been created laws and awareness campaigns to alert people and; therefore, some adults believe increase the minimum legal age is the best solution to solve this problem and I totally agree with this assumption. This essay will explain why governments should think of this alternative and I will explain my point of view in detail. Ċ Although some individuals do not agree with the modification on the legal age for driving, these people should discuss more this topic since youngers do not have a complete awareness about their actions which leads to more accidents among this population. Otherwise, these people claim the act of driving so earlier is a sign of freedom whereas youngers would have more independence without the supervision of the adult. For instance, a sixteen-year-old boy driving could assume in parts the control of his life. In addition, the culture of teaching a son drives is an ingrained habit in many families. Ċ In some parts of North America, the legal age for driving is sixteen but according to some international research in this moment of life, teenagers are just starting to think about current issues on the planet, their concerns are innocent yet. For example, younger drivers around sixteen years are completely immature to assume a substantial responsibility such as the control of the car, the concerns with other lives in the traffic. Furthermore, they do not have control over alcohol drinks while they are driving, which leads to dangerous and serious accidents. The less age, the more inconsequential acts. For these reasons, I totally agree with the increase in the limit age to become a driver so that roads can be safer. Ċ In conclusion, governments and society should carefully think about the rules to become a driver, since the number of accidents has been increasingly present among youngers. This essay discoursed why authorities should discuss the full legal age and I explained my opinion."
11165,The main reason people go to work is to earn money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people think work is just a way of maintenance, and a job is as well paid as its salary is. In this essay I'm going to discuss why I disagree with the thought that having a job is only for making money. Ċ One of the arguments used to defend that position is that without a job you can't earn money, and money is neccessary to live. Though I agree at some point with this view, above all when it comes to families with no other way to survive, we can observe in our socienty a lot of examples of people working for no remuneration. Volunteers, charities and non-paid interships. Some of them feel they are paid enough with the wellness obtained from contributing to make a better world and to help other people. In the case of interns, they make their job very often without any grant or fellowship, just for the pleasure of learning or gaining some experience. But there are other little gorup of people with patrimony big enough to live their whole lives without having a job, but even then, they work for different reasons: to feel useful people, to mantein all the efforts their ancestor did, or to fill in their artistic ambitions. Ċ The other main argument is that salary is a good tester of success and one of the most important criteria for people when the choose a job. But I think other factors as working near your home, schedules, prospective promotion, and good working enviroment are as important as salary and play an important role when making a decision. It's known there are fields (as researching, for example) where people develope a very important role not so well-paind. Ċ In conclussion, there are a lot of motivations for people to work, not only money although in same cases this is the imperative reason."
11166,Tobacco is a kind of drug. People have been free to use it. Some people think that it should be illegal to use it comparing with other drugs. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What is your opinion?,"There are various kinds of drugs and Tobacco is one of them and there is no restriction to the people to use it. There is an argument that compared with other drugs such as Heroine and Pathedrine, tobacco should be banned. This essay totally disagrees with this view because nicotine has a different impact on human than other drugs and it can be used for health treatment. In my opinion, it is better to make a new regulation than banning. Ċ People have been smoking for a long time and it has been seen that its impact on health and society is different than other drugs. Alcohol, Heroine, Marijuana, Cocaine taking person behave a different way, such as they lose control over themselves, use slang language or start fight to an unknown issue. For example, there was a study at the University of New South Wales on domestic violence where alcoholic persons are more keen to involve in a violent activity than smokers. Moreover, smoking cigarettes help people to have a short relief from their stress and anxiety. People smoke because they take it as a self medication. Therefore, banning tobacco products will create a social chaos where these smokers will go anywhere to buy their cigarettes. Ċ Smoking has lots of negative effects on healths such as lung cancer, heart disease, tuberculosis, but it might be used for good health products. Researchers have found that Marijuana can be used for the treatment of Alzimer sickness. Similarly nicotine can be used for other disease and making tobacco illegal will not give any chance to have more research. However, Governments need to have a clear law on producing tobacco and its related products where the companies will have to act and follow the regulation. In addition to this, banning smoking in a public place should be the first priority because it harms passive smokers. Ċ In conclusion, individuals have been smoking for a long time and there was no banning on it because it does not have an immediate impact like other drugs. Sometimes people smoke to release mental pressure and it could be used for future medication. It is predicted that, there will be global rules for smoking tobacco."
11167,"Topic Show the similarities and differences in the ways that two cultures celebrate an important event, such as a birthday, wedding, or funeral.","All countries in the world are unique. Obviously, countries are different from one another in location, size, language, climate, lifestyles and culture. Vietnam and America are also in this cycle. Due to the tremendously differences in culture, they have their very own ways to celebrate their wedding. Ċ The significant similarity between American weddings and Vietnamese weddings is that event is a milestone in everyone's life. It marks their maturity as the bride and groom are going to build their own family with a lot of responsibilities. In addition, it is a time when family, relatives and close friends reunite to congratulate on their new life and bless the brides and grooms. Ċ However, Vietnamese weddings and American weddings are various in location, time, and how they hold the ceremony. While American people, who believe in God, often arrange their wedding in church, Vietnamese weddings usually take place at home or in a luxurious hotel. Another difference is the way they conduct the wedding. In America, after the brides walk through the aisles, everyone will listen to the toasts given by the best men or bridesmaids. Then the bride and groom will make their vows, put the rings on one another finger and share a kiss. After the ceremony, the American newly-wed couples will go on a honeymoon. On the contrary, the most fundamental etiquette in Vietnamese weddings is praising their ancestors. Afterwards, the bride will be taken to groom's house for the other similar etiquette. Unlike weddings in America, which often last for few hours, Vietnamese weddings may take place in one or even two days. Ċ Although Vietnam and America have something in common, there are remarkable differences that make each country unique and creative. That is what make the world extraordinary."
11168,Many keep pets in their home; however they do not take care of the well being of the pet animals. How can you keep the pets while attending their well being also. Discuss?,"From time immemorial human beings trained animals and kept as pets for hunting, as messenger, security, for transportation and in order to get rescued. Dominent pet animals are Dogs, Cats, Horses, Birds, Horses, fishes etc. Often these animals are under captivity and are unattended therefore leading to an unconscious cruelty towards the animals. Ċ Lack of technical knowledge about the animals habitat will leads the animal's life in a terrible risk. Particularly exotic animals of a different habitat required food of their own habitat. Lack of knowledge about their habitat will lead the animal into its slaughter house. Thought animals can be trained in the long run initially they have to be well treated. Ċ Nowadays fish tanks are decorative items in most of the visiting rooms. Sometimes these fish tanks are becoming death chambers. Feeding habits, pH value, temperature, salinity are some of the remarkable reasons behind it. Ċ Fishes are categorised as lower lying and upper lying fishes based on their movement in water. If the feeding has done only in the upper areas of the fish tank the lower lying fishes won't survive for long. PH value determines the acid alkali ratio of the water. Acid and alkali concentration also has to be taken into account and should be maintained. Temperature and salinity also plays a major role in the survival of fishes. Ċ If properly attended pets will show its loyalty, gratitude and reciprocation towards their master. The lethargic attitude that human beings show towards their pets always threatens the animal's life. Vetenary doctors and trainers are guides to take care of the pets. Internet also provides vital information regarding the exotic breeds of animals and their habitats."
11169,"""some people choose a career according to the social status and salary it will give them. Others choose a career according to whether they will enjoy the work."" Which do you think is best way to choose a career? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. The Best Ways of Selecting a Professional Career","Selecting a career path is one of the most critical choices in one's life. However, the reasons of which people are selecting their careers upon are varied from one person to another. Although contested by many, it is argued that selecting a career that you enjoy working with is more beneficial. This can be proven by analyzing how it can help improve both productivity and happiness among people. Ċ When people do something because they like it, they usually product better by bringing new ideas and working harder to produce the perfect product. A research took place at Osmania University in India three years ago, showed that people who like their jobs are never late and never leave early. Moreover, they take a minimum time for lunch break. In fact most of them have lunch while working. As this example shows, better productivity is attributed to selecting a career that you enjoy. Ċ In addition, people feel happier in their life when they like their work. For instance, one of my friends who works as a doctor and is picking up a huge salary, complains all the time about his work and the pressure that he is facing. While his brother who is a painter is very happy with his work, even when his income is much smaller than his brother's. it is clear that people get happy when they work in a field that they enjoy. Ċ In a nutshell, I can confidently say that choosing a career that you enjoy working with makes you both a better worker in the society and happier. Hence, I hope that people consider what work they like to do more than anything else."
11170,Countries are becoming more and more similar because people are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world. Do you think this is a positive or negative development? country losing its identity by selling foreign products,"In today's world, people can purchase goods from another country with just one click or phone call. There are people who think that this is a bad incident because it will change the countries to become more look alike. It is a controversial discussion and thinks it is a negative progress. I am going to talk about it in more details in following paragraphs. Ċ On one hand, each country has its own unique culture that fits best for their people. The culture includes of how they dress and what they use. For example, the culture in my country is to wear hijab, it is a way of dressing and it is specific to here. I think foreign clothes are not the best choice here, but they are available and affecting the way people dress directly. In my opinion, a country that loses its traditions will be left with nothing the future. Ċ On the other hand, there are a few countries in the world that have strong industries, when people buy everything from other countries, it certainly going to help these countries economy. Instead, it will kill the local industries, because they can not compete against countries like China. For instance, in a period in my country, it was trending to use foreign products instead of our own goods. It led to a huge disaster in the economy and lots of companies became broke. Ċ In conclusion, two ideas were presented in this essay. Overall, I think using foreign products can have bad effects on the countries. The country will both lose their identity and economy."
11171,"Some people think that in order to prevent illness and disease, governments should make efforts in reducing environmental pollution and housing problems To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statements?","Many individuals think that reducing environmental pollution and also housing problems can be one of the most viable solutions in order to prevent illness and disease. In my opinion, although many diseases that are related to environmental issues can be prevented by reducing pollution, personally housing problems should be considered in a wider view. The aim of this essay is to discuss the argument and it will represent relevant examples. Ċ To begin with, it is important to bear in mind that environmental pollution can have many serious detrimental impacts on the human body. For example, it should be considered that lung cancers are more common amongst people who have been living in the industrial region due to air pollution. Furthermore, even noise pollution can cause adverse effects on people’s health conditions mentally. Consequently, doubtlessly considerable effort should be spent by the authorities in order to provide a better healthy environment to their societies. Ċ Secondly, the lack of housing rights in conjunction with the absence of the other fundamental rights such as accessibility of clean water and paid employment, are able to cause rampant consequence on individuals’ health. The improvement of people's condition should be provided by the government however the sole effort on housing problems can not be beneficial in order to prevent illness. Hence, to create a healthier society, the government should make efforts on the fundamental right of people in a wider view instead of only solving housing problems. Ċ To conclude, many individuals thought that efforts should be made by the government for reducing pollution and housing problem in order to prevent illness and disease. Environmental pollution has the potential to cause an adverse impact on humans health situations nevertheless this essay thought that only solving the housing problem should not be an adequate solution to prevent diseases, therefore it should be dealt with in a larger perspective."
11172,Many people are treating pets as their own family member. What are the problems and their solutions? getting too emotionally attached with pets,"Parents in numerous families consider domestic animals, as their own children. This essay will discuss about the fundamental issue associated with such ubiquitous way of behaving pets as family and suggest its relevant solution. Ċ People definitely will have atrocious psychological effect after the loss of their loved ones. In a similar way, people with great attachment toward their pets are expected to have same effect. People often keep pets for the good companionship and eventually, end up being too emotionally attached with them. The lifespan of most common pets, particularly of dogs and cats, is considerably less than that of humans. It is therefore, most likely that people will face the loss of their pet in their lifespan. As a result, people tend to suffer from different mental illness and even lack acumen in doing general work. For instance, many psychologists are having regular patients frequently suffering mentally from the death of their pets. Ċ The principal solution to this harmful problem may be keeping more than one pet at a time or preferably of different genders of same breed. This not only can have opportunity of having young ones if different sexes were allowed to mate but also help people to cope with the situation when one of the pets sadly dies. People, these days, are practicing of having 3 or 4 pets, mostly of different breeds or species to have better security of fellowship. Ċ Therefore, getting too emotionally attached with pets is the main problem of treating them as family, which can be solved by having more pets than having only one pet. Hence, it is somewhat innocuous solution to the problem which otherwise can have violent effect on one's psychological state.."
11173,"Some think Government spending on Infrastructure (Transport, Housing etc) is considered the most important for a nation. While others believe that Education, Health and HR values to be more important areas for government expenditure. Discuss both views and give your opinion","Although many would argue that the expenditure on developmental activities is more significant, others and I feel that funds utilised on public welfare healthcare, education because of people are more essential for a state than developmental activities. This essay discusses both sides' arguments followed by my opinion on public welfare. Ċ It is clear that public well-being should be at the highest priority to any state as these are very basic and essential for everyone. Providing better healthcare to the public will enable them to keep healthy which will have a positive effect on their lifestyle and also contribute to the GDP of a nation through their work produced in any sector. Likewise, education plays an important role in nation-building. It enables more folk to acquire knowledge and skills in a particular field which ultimately have a positive effort on their productivity and have a good lifestyle. it is therefore agreed that funding for the welfare of the public is a very worthwhile decision. For example, a person who graduates from a university with good skills and is employed in any sector indirectly contribute to the development of that sector. Ċ However, many disagree and feel that developmental movement such as infrastructure, transportation, housing will enable the public to have a good environment, easy access to places or can travel without any connectivity issue and good facilities to the community etc. But, it will significantly raise the borrowings of the government, which ultimately have more negative effects on the public like higher tax collection, security issues and this essay disagrees investing in development action is more crucial than the former one. Thus, it is always good to build a nation from what we have rather than borrowing from other sources. For instance, if a region is fully facilitated of amenities thru debt but the basic needs related facilities are not for the public which converts into a hard condition to live there. Ċ In conclusion, while the benefits of public prosperity, particularly health and education, allow better returns in the manner of overall development of individuals, some still feel that society should be wary of this investment and not allow it, though ,as long as it is essential to keep in mind the importance of funding in public benefit, the educational and healthcare benefits are clearly positive."
11174,Individuals can do nothing to change society.Any new developments can only be brought about by governments and large institutions. How far do you agree or disagree?,"A great number of changes or new developments were brought about by big organizations or governments in the past history.This led a great many of people to believe that individuals are not able to change the society. Ċ Take the amazing industrial achievement of former Soviet Russia as an example.The whole nation achieved 90 per cent of industrialization within ten years by the incorporation of industrial factories.This made it possible for different factories to get the highest production because the advantages were combined together .Government policies were also the key factor contributed to the rise of Soviet Russia.The economy developed in a short time for the reason that official policies adjusted the nation's development pattern,boosting all the people to contribute and work hard for their motherland. Ċ Although a lot of historical evidence like I mentioned above could be found to support the fact that the new developments are always brought about by big organizations,individuals are still proved to be able to make contribution to the whole society.For instance,physics developed a lot after the discovery of gravity.It is on the base of gravity that physics scientists could be able to put up with various theories and explore universe.This discovery,however,is found by an individual named Newton.As a result ,we can know that individuals can also bring about new and beneficial developments to change the society. Ċ To sum up,I don't think that individuals cannot bring influences or changes to society.They,like governments and large organizations ,are also the part of society.Therefore.they can also do something to change society."
11175,Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Other say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Certain individuals declare that granting the economic assistance and caring of the old population to be catered by the state, while others object this notion, saying that it is the responsibility of the person to preserve the money for their retirement during the youth. My personal perspective is although it is a burden, the authority should fund the elderly crowd because the state has an obligation to do so. Ċ To begin with, arranging the financial assistance and looking after the whole elderly community is an extremely difficult task for the government. This is because, the ruling authorities have a plethora of other domains such as health, education to develop, and deploying a large sum for funding the elderly can compromise other sectors. For an instance, recently, Sri Lanka restricted the large annual budget, which was devoted to granting living allowances the elderly, and diverted this budget to the sector of education to be more benefited and productive. However, I disagree with this notion because disregarding the older population is ethically incorrect. Ċ On the other hand, implementing strategies to comfort the life of old people is an obligation of the government. In fact, these people productively contributed to the nation during their youth through involving the workforce, and neglecting them in their old age is morally unacceptable. Hence, the country should facilitate their life during the old age. For an example, recently in India, people have protested against the ruling party and compelled to give a pension to all retired individuals because they have served and contributed to the country during their youth. Therefore, I agree with this school of thoughts because the state is responsible for the every category of people in the community. Ċ In conclusion, national policies should be established to care and fund the elderly population. This is because, the nation has a strong accountability to safeguard these people, who work for the country, despite the fact that devoting a large budget for the elderly is a great hardship for the ruling party."
11176,"In countries all over the world, the volume of road traffic is increasing at a faster rate than new roads are built. What are the causes of this problem? What are some potential solutions?","Nowadays, all over the world transport congestion is oscillating in a tremendously than the new road are constructed. This essay will discuss about the possible incentives for these trends as well as some mitigate which can be procrastinate to get rid of issues. Ċ One of the main reasons for travel jam is overpopulation. As the number of people all over the globe is escalating day by day, their demand of vehicles for transportation is mushrooming. For instance, a recent investigation concluded that around the globe every year, 5% people are rocketing which demanding more vehicles every year. Moreover, the private vehicle such as car, bike and other vehicles are rocketing each year due to the demand for individuals working or survey purposes giving a hand in traffic issues. To exemplify, nowadays people prefer private vehicles to go to work as class as it's convenient and comfortable for them. For example, people have to travel far from your hometown and public bus, take a long time to reach their so if they have to go to subject or work it's very difficult for them. So, they prefer private vehicles which cause traffic jam. Hence, overpopulation as well as increase private vehicles increasing service problem. Ċ In order to alleviate the above problem government have to play a key role. If they give more prominence on the public transportation like bus with a reasonable cost and comfy it will assist to reduce the problem because it will decrease in number of vehicles. Furthermore, private vehicles need to be banned for office time. This timetable rule should be made by the government to reduce no of vehicles. For instance, in office time hrs if private vehicle is not allowed to drive, then only public transport will be there and there will be a decrease in travel jam. Therefore, Government strict rule and focus on public transport is necessary. Ċ To sum up, although overpopulation and private vehicles have become major causes of transportation congestion, it can be mitigated by the strict rules and regulation of the authority with more priority in public vehicles."
11177,"some people think that the best way to solve the problem of poverty in many countries is to set up businesses and improve trade links with rich countries. cooperation with richer, developed states is beneficial","Establishing new companies in poor countries and rising trade with developed countries is interesting idea to deal with the poverty. Ċ The connection between poor and rich countries help their business is easier.For example, the international companies can help poor countries by contruct a factory to provide jobs for citizen and taxes for goverment build up their countries.In addition,trade links with rich coutries bring to poor coutries many benefits from technology, it can help them solve power resources, industry or medical,such as new modern technical construction can help developing nation decreasing a lot of time build up the facilities. Ċ In my experience,base on the knowledge of rich countries, poor countries can learn a lot of helpful policy in training their people.For instance, if people are taught reading,writing and mathematics,they can improve their own live without outside help.Moreover,they can set up their own small businesses making local goods such as furniture and then they can be sold for export. Ċ In conclusion,maybe poor countries can solve their trouble, but it will be solved quickly and easily by connect with developed nation. Increasing trade links and establishing businesses with rich countries is the best way to improve the financial and economy in many countries."
11178,"In many countries these days, the number of people continuing their education after school has decreased, and the range of courses available at universities and colleges has also increased. Do you think this is a positive of negative development?","Nowadays, education plays a vital role in our life, from the moment we start going to school, till the day we find the job of our dreams. But, in the past few years, more and more people choose not to achieve higher education, while universities have significantly increased their courses. But, do the pros outweigh the cons in this situation? In my opinion, not continuing in higher schooling has a mixture of positive and negative aspects, and in this essay I will discuss why. Ċ Firstly, most individuals do not continue their learning since they want to start earning money and become independent. This is a result of our over consumptive society, and it is unavoidable. Consequently, job positions that otherwise would not be preferred are getting filled up, prospering some undervalued sectors of our economy. To illustrate, the Greek government, issued a study in 2010 which proved that, due to the lack of students going to University the Farming sector had seen a rise of more than 12%. On the other hand, the lack of further learning in the general population, results in a significant decrease in our education level, with consequences in our society’s future. Ċ Regarding the increase in course range, this has two opposite outcomes. On the one hand, it gives students the opportunity to pick exactly what they wish to pursue, rather than something they did not really desire. On the other hand, it makes it more difficult for some students that are not sure for their future to decide, possibly leading them into quitting study. For example, from my own experience as a student, because of the hundreds of options I had to choose from, and my insecurities about pursuing what I liked, I led myself to leaving school and started working in a restaurant. Lastly, it must be noted that, the effects of the huge range of courses are different for every student. Ċ Taking everything into consideration, there are pros and cons, regarding people not attending University. But, it’s my firm belief that, individuals must plan ahead and have the appropriate help from home, in order to take the best possible decision for themselves."
11179,"Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion","In recent times, the number of car accidents is increasing widely. There are a few solutions to lessen traffic accidents; Some argue that we should take stiff punishments like suspending driver’s license while others think that there are better acts suchlike educate folk to drive carefully. I believe the second opinion has a better outcome for making roads safer and declining car accidents. Ċ The primary reason people think stiff punishments are vital is that they believe these penalties can act as a deterrent, meaning that they directly affect careless driving styles, and, therefore, folk avoid repeating the same offence. There are various ways for direct punishment like ceasing a driver’s license, monetary fines, or even prison sentences. All of these methods have psychological effects and cause fear, so people try to obey the law to avoid trouble. For instance, last month police officer fined me 100$ for high-speed driving, and after that, I always pay attention to driving at a low and safe speed. Ċ On the other hand, I believe that safe driving can be promoted indirectly, which has better results. Firstly, it is pivotal to educate individuals properly before they are allowed to drive; this could be done in schools or even in the courses people take before driving tests. Secondly, governments or local councils could increase road safety by investing in better ways, such as installing more road signs to warn folks or speed bumps can be added to calm traffics. Finally, using public transport systems positively reduces car crashes because fewer folks travel by their cars. Ċ In conclusion, while direct penalties are helpful to prevent dangerous driving, I firmly believe that other measures should also be considered."
11180,Too much money is spent on looking after and repairing old bulidings. Some people think money should be spent on buliding new modern buildings. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view? new architecture at the expense of historic and cultural values?,"Nowadays, the rising brand new high buildings were filled in the cities, and the old ones be paid enough attention as well. Recently, there is a debet among the public that if it's worthy to spend more social resources on the new constructions. Ċ Those supporters regard that it would highly accord to a overall city program when we divided the areas with its fuction,such as commercial center, fitness center, with which provide more facilities to the citzens in their daily life. Besides, more new flats could alleviate the pressure of the house renting that urbanization brings. Meanwhile, it may be more atrractive to those investors. Ċ However, the new ones, in some way, have less historic and cultural values when campared to the buildings that withstand times, for countless museum were fund by this reason . Whats more, what we may paid in the new constractions is expensive, such as the environmental pollution and resource waste. Ċ In a word, In my opinion, making new buildings by destroying the old ones cannot resolve all the problems of urbanization. But the coexist may be a win-win choice."
11181,TOPIC:  Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved  Discuss both these views and state your opinion.,"The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved. Ċ There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Ċ Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work. Ċ Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them."
11182,Nowadays for many people the Internet is replacing regular books. What do you think will happen in the future and what is your opinion about this trend?,"With the rapid pace in technological development, the internet has been widely used in various aspects of our lives. For instance, it is very prevalent today for people to read books in the internet compared with decades ago. It is believed that the network development will continually impact people's reading habit, as will be now discussed. Ċ Firstly, it is not doubt that people can assess the books they like online in a convenient manner. The internet has been gradually replacing the physical existence of books. As a result, books publishers has developed electronic books for their customers to satisfy people's changing reading styles. Ċ In addition, libraries are losing their meaning since people rather read books online. Therefore, it is believed that traditional libraries will ultimately be forced to transform to online facilities. People can then assess the online reading materials using their memberships. Ċ Undoubtedly, the convenience of online reading does benefit us in certain ways. Due to the pace advancement in electronic devices, people can read everywhere, just like they are holding a real book. However, I personally prefer reading a real book over a virtual book. The reason is that I can keep my favorite books as collections on my bookshelf which cannot be done by electronic books. For health consideration, concentrating on a monitor for too long will result in detrimental effect on eyes, such as eyesight problem. Ċ All in all, it is for sure that the internet will substitute books in the future. this trend is beneficial to human being as the convenience of online reading is undeniable."
11183,Some people argue that space exploration has had more to do with national pride than international effort. To what extent do you agree with this? How do you think space exploration will change in the future?,"Since 20th century, some countries have started exploring the space as this aims international effort. While it is utterly unacceptable since majority countries carry out this occasion only for their pride, I would argue in the future people will leave behind this program and concern in people's welfare. Ċ With concern in making their countries superior, some of governments do their best in space exploration albeit countries' income should be cut off. Anhar Gonggong, a well-known Indonesian historian, states that all developed countries compete in order to achieve a title as the most powerful country in this world. Taking cold war as sample, between 1947 and 1991, two fascinating countries which were America and Uni soviet performed their latest modern space breakthrough with aims to leave behind each other. This results in America being a well-known as the superpower country which had successfully landed in the moon. From such occasion, I believe this notion only brings benefit for national pride than international scale. Ċ Money is the main problem for such exploration. Wasting a great number of budgets is a pivotal consideration why worldwide governments have to think twice funding annual project. Norm Augustine, team leader of President Barack Obama's staff for space exploration, said NASA experiencing budget problems. In Forthcoming era, I believe people over the world tend to spend their countries' income through communities' welfare than carrying out space exploration. Ċ In conclusion, countries which explore the space only bring the prestigious awards for their nation rather than international importance. In any case, people will be bound to leave their dream in space exploration because of money needed."
11184,The number of animals disappearing is increasing at an alarming rate . This essay will discuss several main factors that cause this situation and suggest some solutions.,"In my opinion, the growing rate of animal extinction was due to both on land and in sea reasons. Ċ First of all, on the ground, cutting down an enormous rain forest area leads to damage to wildlife habits. Therefore, animals will be put at a higher risk because they can not find home and face numerous difficulties adapting to the new living environment. Another factor that puts animals on the verge of extinction is that various human activities result in adverse impacts adversely on the marine environment. For example, waste discharged from factories and residents' houses and oil spills during extraction contaminate water, which poses a serious threat to marine species. Ċ Solving these problems requires the collaboration of Government, Business Company, and Residents. First of all, stricter punishment should be imposed on illegal logging, overexploitation, deforestation, and overfishing. Next, Businesses and Companies should install proper waste treatment systems to freshen wastewater before discharging it to land, river, and ocean. The government should also provide financial support to organizations fighting for environmental rights and action to run the campaign to raise people's environmental awareness. And lastly, the educational program should be adjusted to include more knowledge about the harmful consequence of the pollution for animals' existence. Ċ In conclusion, if there are no proper solutions, animals will suffer from a higher risk of extinction, which results in undesirable negative effects on the ecosystem."
11185,Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves.Which do you think is better?,"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privet companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I woud prefer to work for myself, and have my own business.There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. Ċ In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privet works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it. Ċ What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair. Ċ Finally, there are some authorities in privet jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. when you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed. Ċ There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities."
11186,"International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this? Give reasons for you answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experiences.","Over the last decades, international tourism has become even more prosperity than ever before. Although it contributes thousands of job opportunities and benefits related industries. The ramifications cannot be ignored. In the following essay I will target on this issue along with causes behind the successfulness of tourism industry. Ċ Although interchange different cultural value flourish people's perspective for both visitors and host residents, yet, certain negative behavior might have comes along with hard currency. While the destination becomes a playground by the affluent one, problems such as prostitution as well as alcoholism and substance abuse may have also been imported. This particularly happened in developing or undeveloped countries such as Thailand, Indonesia. In addition, young people of the host countries might give up schools in order to improve family income which could lead them to be exploited as cheap labors. In the long term, these un-well educated people's career opportunities still restricted on low wage, low skill and menial services. Ċ Another significant effect is environment degradation by the influx of tourists and excessively reclamation for exclusively to meet the demand of vast visitors. Immense areas of trees have been cut down in order to build villages. Vast amount of infrastructure development reduce the habitats of wildlife. Countless wastes and filth has been left by travelers which cause the pollution of river, ocean, mountain and any elsewhere.

However, earth is our only home, balances between environment and economic development should be sought to sustain all the lives on this planet."
11187,"Some people have the opinion that big shopping malls are expensive places as they offer high costs for the products which can be bought at much cheaper prices from local shops. On the other hand, some people think that such malls are absolutely the best places to visit for shopping. Ċ Discuss both the opinions and give your own opinion. Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Certain people believe that shopping centre charges extensively than the small trader, while others advocate that these big retail outlets are the finest places to purchase anything. This essay will discuss both ideals and establishes my preference. Ċ To being with, shopping malls are expensive locations to buy anything, while regional vendors have the same products at its lesser prices. This is because the tax levied on the products is not applicable to individual sellers. For instance, the iPhone purchased from a big store can be of a higher price, while the same phone bought from the local shop is inexpensive. Ċ On the other hand, most people prefer buying the material from these huge retail complexes. This is because they give good quality products with proper bills and receipts, they even have a 30 day return policy, so if the customer is not satisfied with their services they items can be returned. Moreover, these centres would have varied facilities that provoke families to come together and buy goods. For example, most of these places have centralized air conditioning along with the food court and a kids zone. Hence the family feels relaxed and joyous to come to these places. Ċ In conclusion, many people believe that large shopping areas have costly products in comparison to the individual shops, while others argue that they find malls an exciting place to visit. In my opinion, these enormous retailers have extended the facilities like trial policy, discount, and return policy in addition to the comfort a customer gets while shopping is prominent. Thus, I think that going to these places is the best activity for buying things."
11188,pollution and other environmental damage is caused mainly by developing countries which helps them become richer. To what extent do you agree with this opinion?,"Environmental issues are the greatest concern of every human living in this world. Developing countries are focused to earn more money, and causing damaging effects to the environment in various factors pollution is one of them. I totally agree with this statement because, Every developing country is trying hard to build better economies. This essay will support my opinion with relevant examples. Ċ To begin with, Many developing countries are seriously competing with developed countries in order to reach their level, So most of them are producing their own goods to earn more profits in the world trading. But, unfortunately, they are neglecting the fact that how excessive wastage they are produced by their manufacturing factories. For example, India is the largest producer and supplier of the clothing materials, which requires many factories for manufacturing. Rather than disposing the wastage properly, It is dumped into the ocean without any concern. Due to this water contamination problem is becoming one of the serious risks to the environment. Ċ Another point to be noted, Developing countries always wanted to save money so they barely take part to save the environment. As they believe in the present development, and not thinking about the future generations and mother nature. Firstly, pollution is causing global warming with a high speed which is the major concern in the world. For instance, According to the environmental research institute, 60 percent of the pollution is produced by developing countries which is the main reason behind global warming as a result. Secondly, poor nations do not have much expertise and guidance, While they are creating detrimental effects to the environment. Therefore, If developed nations step in to help such countries for providing a better guiding path, This can protect the environment more feasibly. Ċ In conclusion, most developing countries are blamed for destroying the environment because their main intention is to become rich. I strongly agree with the above statement because, I feel their main concern is to develop their economy."
11189,opinion essay ( ielts writing task 2) a large number of parents and students think that the current college entrance examination should be abolished altogether. what do you think? write about 300 words to support your position.,"In this day and age, the majority of parents and pupils persist on completely rejecting the college entrance exam while the others are in the opposite point of view. From my perspectives, I firmly believe that the university entrance test should be continuously maintained for these following reasons. Ċ To begin with, through entrance examination, the student's capacity will be assessed in an accurate way to classify base on their levels of the score. Therefore, the learner with great outstanding academic performance is likely to enrol at the prestigious institution with the aim to have better access to challenging learning resources and exposure to other peers at the same level. In addition, the lecturer may find it easier to train their students. To be more specific, it is obvious that class that is appropriately graded with the students at the same ability will be taught a relevant way with suitable goals rather than a disorganised one. Ċ Furthermore, the entrance exam has an immense value of understanding development as it contains a chain of wide-ranging knowledge from almost essential subjects, hence it provides learners with the chance to broaden their horizon. They need to review the understanding of specific subjects like Math, English or Literature to prepare well for their performances and compete with other peers. What's more, after taking the exam, the learners will realize where they are standing at the crowd and have the indispensable betterments for their own studies. Consequently, there is a high likelihood that each student's education level and comprehensive development will be enhanced and completed quickly. Ċ In conclusion, it is my view that the college entrance exam needs remaining currently due to its great value of education on the basis of my analyses and explanations."
11190,More renewable energy sources are harnessed to generate electricity these days. What are disadvantages and advantages of this trend?,"Nowadays, society tends to use an alternative resource such as renewable energy to produce electricity. This trend can save the fossil fuel usage for several years to come, it also requires a huge cost. Ċ In the future, people can keep fossils fuel from extinction. This is due to the fact that society switches to use alternative energy as their main source to produce electricity. For example, a current survey carried out by the Japanese Government in 2013 released that using an alternative resource such a solar panel can push the rate of fossil fuel by 40%. Consequently, energy will be collected by the alternative resource to generate electricity gives a long-term effect on their circumstances. Ċ However, citizen needs a lot of money to build up cutting-edge technology tools to generate electricity from alternative resource. The reason for this the equipment is hard to find out, even include rare items. Besides, only a few person can understand about making this tools. A great example for this is coming from Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry of China released the result of survey in 2014 that showed roughly 10% of people using alternative energy in their atmosphere. Therefore, it is true that only a few people who use alternative resource as main resource in their home. Ċ Overall, this essay explained about benefit and drawback in usage alternative resource. The benefit of this trend is fossil fuels reserves for a longtime later, while for the drawback is the high charge to build up sophisticated tools to produce electricity."
11191,Some people think that children should be homeschooled when they are very young whioe others think it is better for them to attend a kindergarten. Which do you think is better? Ċ Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"Few people consider those teaching children in the home when they are young will be a good decision where remaining think that attending kindergarten would be better. In my opinion, both perspectives have their own pros and cons, which will be discussed briefly in the upcoming paragraphs. Ċ On the one hand, some Parents feel like teaching their younger ones in their lap will be the perfect solution to avoid school fear in them from a very young age. In addition to that, mother's can take care of them while working on household chores where kids also enjoy learning in a fun way from the well known first teacher which is their mother. For Instance, Young babies when they attend their lower education in school, they become panic because of the new environment, friends and teachers which takes lots of time to get used to the crowd around them. Moreover, being away from parents for the first time make them stressed. Ċ On the other hand, by sending their newborns to kindergarten, mothers and fathers become relaxed and will be getting free time to spend for themselves. Mother can concentrate on her work like shopping, buying vegetables and some other house related stuff. However, children get used to schooling and managing things likes books, pencils and bags on their own which in turn help in recognising things from the early stage of their lives. For example, kids who attend classes from a very young age spend time engaging with new friends, playing with toys that make them active, clever and thoughtful. Ċ I would like to conclude by saying that attending kindergarten or learning from parents in homeschool, both have their own benefits, in order to, develop young people mind and activities."
11192,Young people these days tend to be less polite and respectful than in the past. What are the causes and give your solutions?,"Nowadays, young people are often being taught to believe in themselves. It might lead to a problem that they may show less respect for others. In this essay, the causes of the problem will be discussed and some possible solutions will be provided. Ċ The main issue of this behaviour may come from being overconfident. In fact, youngsters are often being told that they should believe in what they are doing and also their abilities. However, this may cause a reverse effect that young people may not easily open to suggestions but always think that their thought is correct. Since they are young and lack of experience, this characteristic may not change if they have never encountered any failure in their life. Ċ There are many solutions to this problem and one of them should be to educate students about the value of each individual. For instance, young people need to be able to value different opinions and understand that they are not about being personal but rather constructive since others may only want to help. Furthermore, the ability to listen to other people's thought and analyse them is also important to be developed. Thus, with some changes to education systems, young people should be encouraged to believe in what they can do as well as respect other people's abilities. Ċ To conclude, it is true that young people may need to learn how to communicate with others with politeness and respect. It may need to start with the education which provided for them by teaching them to listen to other ideas and thought."
11193,"In the past, when students did a university degree, they tended to study their own country. Ċ Nowadays, they have more opportunity to study abroad. Ċ What are the advantages and disadvantages of this development? Ċ you should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.","In the olden days, the majority of the students pursued their tertiary education in their native nation. However, the trend has been changed. Nowadays, number of students are in an urge to study in foreign countries, because of the cultural and technological exposure. In this essay, we will go through it's positives and negatives. Ċ Firstly, we are not limited to a minimum number of courses as we did in our past. Indeed, the subjects that, are being taught now are becoming more specific and relevant to the major that, we tend to learn. Moreover, students are very clear in what they wish to study, and don't want any other irrelevant things to go through. For instance, in the foreign universities, an individual has his own liberty to learn things that, he desperately needs to. So this apparent facility has led students to go to abroad for college education. Thus, it is evident that, it is because of the distinct amenities, which attracts the students all over the world. Ċ Secondly, when individuals move to another country for education majority of them stay there till the end of their lives. Because of the attractive salary, and the kind of sophistication they accustomed to it. Furthermore, the family bonding, and the lifestyle changes completely, which would result in the disruption of generation, and their life cycle. For example, when a person migrates from his own country, and spends his whole life in another country, it creates abrupt discontinuity in his culture, transportation, he is not able to teach his own home language, and rituals to the future generations. Therefore, it is so bad to forget a civilization. Ċ In conclusion, after analysing both the sides, it is very clear that, the prospects of a better life are high on foreign countries. In the meantime, as a responsible parent, we must take care of our heritage too."
11194,Many people find it difficult to speak in front of and to present to an audience. It is believed that this skill should be taught in school. Why is this important? To what extent do you agree or disagree with it?,"Many individuals find it challenging to present themselves in front of people. It is considered that schools should be responsible for teaching public speaking. It is important as almost every field of study requires a demonstration of projects in one way or the other. I completely agree with this notion for two reasons; it helps students in giving job interviews along with giving a boost to the confidence at the very early stage of their life. Ċ Firstly, being able to speak persuasively and confidently is an essential skill for almost everyone. For such reason, a good deal of this expertise is required in a professional career. Although schools may find it difficult to indulge this skill in the course outline at the beginning, they will not regret it in the future as a clear and confident voice fosters self-esteem and personal assurance of the students. For example, it can be illustrated by the fact that 80% of the world's leaders have influenced their audiences verbally. Therefore, I believe that it should definitely be part of the curriculum. Ċ Secondly, this skill plays a vital role when students are interviewedSuggestioninterview for a job post. Because of having an ability to explain and justify the degrees, one can easily get the desired position in the workplace. For instance, surveys at the University of Manchester have revealed that 90% of the people are rejected in the interview session due to poor communication skills. Thus, it's high time that schools take oratory skills as seriously as any other basic skills. Ċ In conclusion, many people struggle while speaking in front of the audience. I agree that teaching the art of public speaking should be mandatory in schools. It has been discussed in this essay how good communication skills can help in overcoming the fear of public speaking and uplifting confidence."
11195,Some people feel that the primary function of a university should be to prepare students for the working world. Others argue that the purpose of university education is to provide knowledge for knowledge’s sake. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.,"It is often believed that universities should prepare the students for the complete job whereas others think that colleges have a responsibility of giving them education only. It is not their headache to prepare them to work in the market. In my point of view, colleges are responsible for providing learning as per their working environment. I will discuss both views and would like to elaborate in the below paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, It is correct that gives students complete knowledge is college responsibility. But that studies must lead them to some good path. For example, apart from the basic subjects in academics, they must introduce competitive books from the initial semester only. Furthermore, It helps them to crack the competitive exam for jobs in the initial stage itself. Consequently, immediately after passing the university,they could able to do the work and earn their living on their own. Ċ To continue with the second decision, If the university focuses on the basic subject of academics, it might be like cramming the subjects that do not even help them to enter the working world. Although, without basic studies, children cannot survive because from the subjects like mathematics or data structure they cannot perform the programming. On the other side, they must have knowledge of their shortcuts to clear the entrance exam. So in my opinion, both the basic and competitive education is necessary because if one cannot earn after gaining higher education, then there is no use of passing the degree. Ċ To conclude, It would be fine if both the comments go on side by side. It would really help the students to get knowledge as well as jAdd an articlea It appears that an article is missing before the word job. Consider adding the article. Ċ show examplesob for their living."
11196,The prevention of health problems and health illness is more important than treatment and medicine. Government funding should reflect this. To what extent do you agree.,"There are a plethora of health issues these days, avoidance of this is vital rather than curing with a remedy or therapy. Government must disburse the finances toward it. I strongly agree with this statement and will elaborate on my views on this in the following essay. Ċ To embark on, healing and restoring health conditions is always followed by the doctors since the beginning, but not all illnesses can be cured. There are a lot of viruses that cannot be cured instead they spread widely without knowing costing many lives. This has increased nowadays, and scientists or medical researchers found it difficult to stop. For example, there was a spread of the Ebola virus in the North-American region where doctors could not figure out the proper medication for it which costed many lives. It may be more difficult in future to prohibit these diseases. Ċ In addition to it, there is a lack of required vaccine for immunity that can protect an individual from these diseases. However, it is expensive if in case it is available somewhere else where an average person could not afford it. Moreover, these vaccines are not effective to withstand a virus or a disease that can spread easily. Governments should focus on preventing individuals rather than affording too much on the remedies which could cure a person. This can be only done if excessive funds are released for this prevention. For instance, if the vaccines are provided for free or at a low cost, everyone can take them. Thus, one can be prevented by these illnesses. I strongly agree that this should happen rapidly to avoid major losses or sudden deaths because of these health issues. Ċ In conclusion, It is agreeable that government should release a plethora of funds for vaccination to prevent one from these diseases or viruses rather than concentrating on therapies or medication. It is recommended that this should be followed in an organized way so that everyone would have access to it."
11197,"""It is better to be underrated by people than to be overrated by them.""  What are your thoughts on the above statement? Overrated things","are misleading and particularly annoying for people who are not impressed by the superficial things in life. While people may fall for the golden exterior we build around things, nobody really sticks around once they find the bottle half empty. Ċ Nothing is worse than standing in line for the opening of a grand restaurant that has been shamelessly advertising on every television channel, only to walk out with pasta that tastes like plastic. Perhaps if you had gone to the shabby little café down on main street that apparently made really good pizza, you may have ended up with a happier stomach. Ċ However, we cannot blame our attraction to glorified materials. It is human nature for us to be left awe-struck after walking past a limo parked in front of a fancy hotel. And it is not our fault when we peek inside, hoping that a famous stranger, we know nothing about, is staring straight back at us. It is our nature to be fooled by such superficial things and even though it may sound like humanity's tragic tale, we all know it is true. Ċ When things are underrated, we allow room for improvement. We allow ourselves to make the journey to greatness and achieve all that we desire to achieve. But when we glorify things that need not be glorified, we envelop them in a falsehood, shielding their true nature from the world. Ċ The question, alas, we must ask ourselves is, would I rather be loved for the imperfect person that I am, or for the amazing qualities I don't have? And when we build relationships around falsehoods like that, how long do these bonds between us last?"
11198,"Some people think saving money is good, but others think that spending money is a better way to enjoy life.Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge.","These days, a number of nations assume that saving expenses for a rainy day are an incredible solution, however, many citizens have an opposite opinion, and they think consuming costs and satisfying from their lives is better than saving cash. In this essay, I will be explained both arguments and express my view. Ċ On the one hand, some nations argue that saving wealth is the best choice they have. Firstly, all families have allocated some budget for a month, and they have to estimate their expenses. My point is, people have predicted all expenses namely, their rents, equipment, and children’s needs. Secondly, all expenditures have inflation, and they ought to balance the books and save for a rainy day. Consequently, citizens think to save money and evaluate all costs are significant these days. Ċ On the other hand, most folks believe that nothing is better rather than using money and have fun in their lives. It can be argued that consuming expenditures and purchase everything they want to bring joy in their lives. In addition, they are merely thought about the present time and want to establish the best moments. For instance, sometimes people arrange a party or journeys together due to the fact they want to be blessed and using their lives, do not care about money just having entertainment. In my opinion, nothing better than living in a moment and consuming wealth and create memorable times with your families. If you wish to enjoy your alive and consume payment, you have to create a balance between them. Ċ In conclusion, both arguments are acceptable and I mentioned my reasons previously, but in my view, they have to create a balance between consume pay and save the expense."
11199,Nowadays for many people the Internet is replacing regular books. What do you think will happen in the future and what is your opinion?,"Internet these days is changing the general book format into the face of online copy and information. In my personal prospect, if the situation stays like this, in future, the huge amount of books will available online, and to buy the hard copy of it will be difficult. These days the audio samples of books are also provided by the publisher on the computer. Ċ Firstly, online drafts are getting popular these days. For an instance, before, people prefer to buy the physical Storybooks and the Novels and they like to keep these in a study room, but now the tablets and the laptops are overtaking their place as the public download the copies on it and carry these with themselves, so they can read whatever they like and wherever they want. It increases the amount of study material one can carry in his/her pockets. Whatever we want to know is just type away from us, as various search engines like Google, Bing, Ask, etc. are present on cyberspace. This will save the cutting of trees for papers. Ċ Moreover, the audio samples of a printed work can be prepared on the net. For example, if a person doesn't like reading, but like listening, he/she can get tapes to listen. This encourages writers to record their work and earn more by selling it. In future, the internet will serve as the vast source of knowledge, as most of the information is stored on it in form of data. Ċ In conclusion, In the modern generation, the humans will depend on the web for information and knowledge, as everyone can see a wide range of literature and other fun books on it for a less amount of money. This approach is exciting and it will save our environment."
11200,Nowadays many people work part or full time from home. Some people say that working from home has many benefits while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It is irrefutable that where people to work is a crucial importance. It is a highly debated issue whether people choose their home for their jobs or if others try to go outside of house to work. Both situations have their own pros and cons which I shall discuss in this essay. Ċ Working at home is what some people prefer because of its advantages. It is very convenient people not to go outside of home and spend a great deal of time for commuting. Working at home saves people's energy to concentrate on their duties, which means workers do not bother themselves to think about how to go to their workplaces, which style they have and what food that they eat at work. What is more, some females really like to work, but they have children who need some special cares. If these women can work at home, doing both of their duties will be very easy. Ċ On the other hand, working in workplace is very important. Firstly, some tasks need special equipments which cannot stay at home such as huge machines. People have to go to workplaces to do their duties. For example, some individuals have to fix and maintain some systems which were set for production process in factory. Secondly, though going to work is very time consuming, working in workplace with colleagues has discipline which cannot achieve at home very easily. In formal atmosphere, workforce has better efficiently. Therefore, it is less waste time during work time. Lastly, communicating with other people reduces some work pressure, because other employees can give some firsthand experiences. Ċ In the final analysis, working at workplace has merits which cannot achieve in solitary environment of house. Some jobs cannot do at home, being in workplace is necessary."
11201,"In modern society, some people argue that schools become unnecessary as student can study at home via the Internet. Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, it has become common to get an education online. In this contemporary era, some individuals argue that studying in conventional schools is not significant and opine that studying online at home is the need of this century. I completely disagree with this notion and, I would explain the reasons for my opinion in this essay. Ċ To embark on, schools are the places where we can make our new friends and we can enjoy studying with another pupil. Additionally, it would become quite boring to study from home through the internet. Moreover, the pupil can also get habituated to the habit of waking early to attend their grade, which would teach them to schedule their time effectively. For instance, Cambridge Research unit has made it clear in their recent research that 90 per cent of the student who attends regular classes are good at time management when comparing it to the scholar who is given online tuition. Ċ On the other, the demerits of online education are many, firstly, students can get eye strain while studying on computers and as a result, they have to wear power glasses from an early age. Secondly, children cannot get personal attention at the home, as well as they cannot improve their hand-writing skills through the screen of the computer. Furthermore, students lose interest in their education if they do not study with their classmates and the online classes rather feel boring for them. For example, when I was in middle school, I had suffered from some illness and consequently, I had to take online classes and was not able to cope with it. Ċ In conclusion, even though it is comfortable to study from home through the internet, however, the advantages of studying in regular schools are many and traditional schools cannot be replaced."
11202,"substantial coverage of crimes in media Giving detailed descriptions of crimes on the press has bad influence, so information of this should be restricted. To what extent do you agree or disagree with you this statement?","Undeniably, crime rate is on the increase. However, substantial coverage of crimes on the mass media has dire consequences to people's life. Therefore, I personally agree with it and people should minimize the underside effects. Ċ Obviously, in-depth news reports about violent contents may potentially pollute children's mind. To be more specific, no matter what the news are, children tend to imitate the actions and behaviors shown on the press. They suppose that violence and death is a normal part in modern society. As a consequence, adolescents subconsciously behave aggressively and cruelly which may give rise to the upsurge of juvenile delinquency. For instance, it is reported that under the contents about brutal fightings, serial killers' influences, teenagers are more likely to have antisocial behavior or illegal activities than those who do not watch. Thus, censorship of this kind of information is necessary. Ċ Another point to consider is the fact that detailed descriptions of crimes may lead to the loss of justice and security of everyone. In other words, news and documentaries illustrating criminal acts may generate fear and anxiety towards people as well as the reality of life. Watchers often mislead to the belief that they are living in a dangerous world. Hence, they develop a sense of insecurity and mistrust if they watch detailed account of crimes on a regular basic. Moreover, because images of this information shown on television are extremely obsessive and disturbing, people do not realize the positive side of life surrounding their environment. Ċ To sum up, although some people argue that considerable coverage of crimes can be beneficial, the adverse impacts of it are undoubtedly inevitable. For this reason, government should censor the contents of mass media to maximize the advantages and lessen the disadvantages."
11203,The current trend in education is to move away from traditional exams and instead have continuous assessment over the school year. What do you think of this trend ?,"As the times pass, many things change in the sphere of life. Similarly, there have been changes in the education system as well. On big change is that these days instead of having bi-yearly exams, students are assessed throughout the year via assignments, tests, projects etc. I think that it is a positive change. Ċ To commence with, the most important advantage of the current trend is that students are connected with the studies year round via assignments, projects, tests etc. This leads to another advantage that because of continuous learning, they get assessed for the whole year. This allows teachers to notice the shortcomings of students early and thus, can help them in a timely manner. For instance, in the sixth standard, my teacher had observed that I was not performing well in geometry. So, she gave me extra assignments to help me cover my weaknesses. Ċ Furthermore, another advantage is that it allows parents to be aware of the work of their child in the class from the very beginning of the session. If parents do not keep a continuous eye on the performance of their kids, then they can easily go off track. The current system provides continuous feedback to kids and thus, parents can take necessary actions for the improvement of their child's performance. For example, a recent study shows that 80% of bad habits in kids can be improved by continuous monitoring and efforts. Ċ To conclude, I think that the current education scheme has eliminated a few of the shortcomings of traditional system. It has also brought many advantages such as continuous assessment and correction of students by teachers and parents can easily keep track of the performance of their kid."
11204,"Job migration to the wealthier countries. An increasing numbers of professionals, such as doctors and teachers, are leaving their own poorer countries to work in developed countries. What are the causes? What are the soulutions?","Professionals, such as doctors and teachers, have a tendency to leave their developing countries to find jobs in developed countries. This essay will examine main causes of this issue and possible solutions. Ċ The two main causes of leaving countries among professionals are the deficiency of high-quality facilities and slim chance to promote. When these white-collar workers live in developing countries, they can not have cutting-edge technology. This way, they stand no chance of working as their desire. For instance, teachers in some rural areas have to commute about 10 km to the schools on foot. Also, promotion is another key factor that deter those professionals from staying in the poor countries. Their salaries are not sufficient, although they indulge themselves on their occupation. Doctors or teachers definitely opt for developed countries where they can devote themselves to their passion without worrying about money. For example, the majority of people in Southeast Asia tend to find scholarships to study abroad and settle down there. Thus, lacking money and poor condition are deterrents for the professionals. Ċ Some possible solutions to this problem are investing money in facilities and have more incentives for white-collar laborers. High-tech devices and machines undeniably make workers focus on their works because they provide them with comfort when working. As a case in point, online lessons emerged in my country in response to a pandemic allow teachers to finish their duty at home, providing them a safe environment to educate the students. Consequently, they are more fanatical about their works. Besides, governments should have some special policies for the professionals because they can draw their interest in their occupation. Ċ In conclusion, low salaries and low-quality facilities are two main factors that make the professionals leave their poor countries. However, we can significantly change this situation by improving the working condition and providing these people with sufficient salaries."
11205,Gasoline cars are still better than electricity cars. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Everything has two sides and Gasoline cars are not an exception. In the last decade`s, it seemed like the most normal way of transportation people, but nowadays many people criticize it. Ċ We must acknowledge that many people prefer gasoline cars than electricity cars, because it gives them a better chance to repair and maintain it. Using mechanics or using a little information, which they gain from friends or books or maybe internet resources. In addition, driving big gasoline cars make people feel fast and strong, which makes it hard for them to change it with electricity cars. Ċ Nevertheless, many people believe that transportation should become cleaner and greener. There are many scientific researches proves how much electricity cars are going to help our environment. Applying these researches is what we really need, so we can grantee a clean air for us, for our children and for next generations. A good example of an electricity cars company, which producing fast big modern cars is Tesla. If People who admire sport cars proceed in replacing gasoline cars with one of Tesla cars, they will realize the truth about electricity cars. Ċ Moreover, electricity cars expenses are less than gasoline cars, because of cheap electricity prices. In addition, electricity cars are easier in implying with technology equipments, so people enjoy driving and navigating easier. I completely disagree that gasoline cars remains useful than electricity cars. Ċ To sum up, there are many evidences that electricity car more useful than gasoline one. Even I recommended that, governments should proceed with some laws, forcing people on replacing gasoline cars with electricity ones."
11206,"Some people think the technology makes life complex, so we should make the life simpler without using the technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, it is true that Technologies are developing such as computers, cars, phones and so on. As a result, they carry some problems with themselves like pollutions, traffics etc. It has been argued that Some people think that the development of technology has made our life more complex, and the solution is to live a simpler life without that. I partly agree with this idea. Ċ It is no doubt true that nowadays, with modern technology such as cars, it is quite common to see these cars in the road. The most families have own a car. Owning to this, everyone can encounter with some problems like compound traffic problems, air pollution and noise. Therefore some people think that modern technology seriously influences our life and causes a confused environment. On the other hand, other drawbacks of technology People had jobs to work in the past but now, the most people can't work or find job because of technology can do some actions instead of about 10 employers. For example, a worker can control engine of car with computer instead of Worker strength. Ċ In spite of about the arguments I tend to believe that more and more people can't imagine our life without modern technology such as computers, smartphones and so on. We use computers to do some exercises like Microsoft word and also to communication with skype or email. As a result, we save our time, paper and shorten distance because of computers. Furthermore, we know about smarthpones. So they make our life much simpler. We just started to use smart phones which can take pictures, surf the internet, play games, take notes and set an alarm on the phone. As a result you can do everything in one smart phone. Ċ in conclusion, in my opinion, developed technology is better for people because at the same time adequate knowledge of people is developed much more."
11207,Health services are the basic necessity for a person. Private companies have made the health services quite costly for ordinary individuals. Do the advantages of private health care outweigh its disadvantages?,"It is commonly believed that the extravagant price of health care has been attributed to the involvement of private enterprises, despite it being a fundamental need of every resident. The principle advantage of private health hospitals is that they offer better facilities than state-own institutions, while the main disadvantage is their extravagant treatment cost making ordinary people impossible to access the healthcare services they need. This essay agrees that its demerit outweigh the merit. Ċ Firstly, providing high-grade equipment and labour forces are the principle advantage of private medical care. This is because a private company makes enormous profits from treatment feeSuggestionthe treatment feetreatment fees of its patients, which is relatively higher than that in public hospitals. Consequently, a big proportion of this profit is invested back in equipping more advanced medical machines and facilities, as well as hiring and training top-notch specialists to serve its clients. For instance, in 2018, MedCare company allocated almost 55% of its profit to purchase MRI machines and building new treatment rooms for its patients. Ċ However, the main disadvantage of the private healthcare system is the high price itself. To be more specific, only the affluent have enough money to pay for examination and operation which are conducted in private hospitals, while a person with low salaries may struggle to pay for medical bills. For example, a survey in 2019 indicates that an ordinary office worker would need up to 1 year to compensate for the money spent on one visit to a private hospital for general health examination. As a result, such poor people would not have equal access to the services in profit-making hospitals, despite receiving medical treatment is a basic necessity. Ċ In conclusion, although profit-oriented hospitals may offer equipments with higher quality than government-owned facilities, their high medical costs still outweigh its merit. If the private sector offered a supportive policy to lower the treatment fee, more people would have equal access to its state-of-the-art facilities which it provides."
11208,"Many animals are being hunted to the brink of extinction in order to fulfill the demand and greed of mankind for decorative purposes as well as for other reasons, such as traditional medicine. How can this issue be tackled?","Human life is dependent on the animals. But, human beings have put many animal species in danger of becoming extinct with the unchecked and extensive hunting for its selfish motives such as house decorations, pleasure etc. It is very important to protect the animals and some measures for this cause must be taken. Ċ To commence with, the population of the world is increasing and to meet the housing and food demands, more and more forests are being cut. This leads to the loss of the natural habitat of animals, which endangers them. The wildlife plays an important role in the food chain. If any element of the chain is lost, then the existence of elements is endangered as well. For example, honey bees help in cross pollination, which is necessary for the growth of the crops. To protect the animals, multiple steps can be taken. Firstly, the government must educate its people and explain the importance of animals for the existence of human life. This way the community will value them. Ċ In addition to this, animals are killed for the ornaments, decorative pieces of art, medicines etc. As an example, elephants are trapped and hunted for their tusks. Therefore, it is very important to save the animals from the brutality. The administration must make stringent laws to punish the people who commit the crime of illegal hunting. Furthermore, it must define the minimum forest cover as well, so that no builder tries to cut the forest to build residential or commercial buildings. For instance, in Coorg, the council has marked the areas to protect the existing forests and the natural habitat of elephants. Ċ To conclude, humans are dependent on the animals for food, leisure and money. Hence, we all must collectively take steps to protect them from extinction. There should be awareness in the community and strict laws to punish the ones who go against the law."
11209,Some people prefer to live with a roommate.Others prefer to live alone.Compare the advantage of each choice.Which of these two options do you prefer? Ċ use specific reasons to support your answer.,"It is true that in many countries , people of all ages tend to choose to live alone and claim that it can be more advantageous for them .While some individuals argue that living with a roommate can have some obvious merits, I take the view that living alone can be the best choice. Ċ On the one hand , there are some reasons that why the population choose to have a roommate at home . The strongest reason is that being alone can lead to having a strong feeling of loneliness which could cause some mental health problems. For example, many studies show that being alone for a long period of time may engender some mental troubles such as depression and anxiety . In addition , sharing a house with other humans can be an economic decision because that means the rent of a house will be divided into two or more sums of money and therefore they will pay less money . Ċ On the other hand , living alone can be a suitable choice for several reasons . Firstly , this approach can help persons to build a strong and independent personality . In other words , facing all problems alone and without help can undoubtedly empower the mindest and increase the will of a person also being responsible for all household and daily tasks can learn the population a lot of personal skills such as discipline and work hard . Consequently , those persons have more chances to succeed in life and achieve their goals in the future . Secondly , being without a roommate at home can give individuals more personal space because the entire place is their personal bubble . For instance , people who share their residence with other humans have less privacy which is not healthy for the development of the personality . Ċ In conclusion , although I think that being with another person at home can have some advantages , I strongly believe that being alone is the best decision because it provides more privacy and helps persons to build a strong character ."
11210,The number of children that read books for fun has dropped dramatically in recent years. What are the reasons for this? How can we encourage children to read more?,"In today’s technologically advanced world, where daily new inventions are taking place, the number of children reading books as a hobby is decreasing drastically as children are opting for other new hobbies to pursue. Ċ There are numerous reasons for this drop. First of all, easy availability of various digital gadgets. In today’s generation children are succumbing to peer pressure to play virtual reality games. Also, children who want to read books are considered boring and not cool which has led to more and more children pursuing all kinds of socially acceptable activities to fit in their social circle. For example, a research conducted in the USA proves that more than 70% of school children can be spotted at various game zones rather than libraries. Ċ Secondly, children tend to imitate their parents. For instance, when they see their parents working on computers all the time, they would want to do that too. Therefore, it is important that the parents should be aware of this fact and take appropriate measures to introduce their children to the habit of reading books at an early stage of their life. Thus, by making sure that they sit with their children and help them read instead of bringing back their office work home. Furthermore, schools should also take initiatives to promote book clubs and bring back the old culture of reading for fun in todays new generation. Ċ To conclude, it is not too late to motivate children to read books for fun. If appropriate steps are taken more and more children can be influenced to read and this drastically dropping trend can be encumbered."
11211,Some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS TYPE OF REQUIREMENT? Give details to support your opinion.,"Being a student with a requirement like that, I strongly disagree with the idea of putting it into one of the graduation limitations. The original meaning of this was to help the student develop better and cultivate the sense of volunteering. Nevertheless, the meaning of volunteer work has completely altered after implementing the graduating requirement. Ċ From my perspective, the definition of volunteer work is an act of dedication to the community or society wholeheartedly without asking for any reward, thus it cannot be quantified. Once doing so, some students will complete the minimum amount of volunteer work with a hasty and rash attitude, and they just regard it as a chore. To them, volunteer work is more like a task than an act inspired by the inner heart, and it defies the original meaning of volunteer work. Moreover, the quality of work done by volunteer workers is also declined because of the above-mentioned attitude among students. Ċ On the other hand, volunteer work seems to be unrelated to a person's academic achievements, which made the restrictions unreasonable. Students may lose their diplomas just because of their insufficient volunteer work ""scores"", which hinders them from applying to universities. Ċ In conclusion, the implementation has defied the meaning of volunteer work radically, and it completely undermines the quality of volunteer work. Without the limitation, students can devote themselves to what they love more, while those who have fond of helping others can do volunteer work more wholeheartedly. For these reasons, I think the minimum requirement for volunteer work should be lifted."
11212,Some people say social media do more harm to the youth. Other people say they do the great to the youth. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion. Ċ Give reasons for your answers and include examples from your knowledge and experience.,"It is argued by some that social media can exert more havoc to youngsters. Nevertheless, others regard it as beneficial to adolescents. I consider it to be neither harmful nor extremely useful to young people. Ċ Social media, as its name shows, encompasses several technological tools such as Twitter, WeChat, YouTuBe and so on in which young people can acquire novel skills that may be absolutely contributive to one's academic study. By using them proficiently as well as frequently, pupils can master capabilities that they may have difficulty to grasp. Aside from being a convenient way of self-improvement in academia, online apps are also effective platforms in which teenagers are able to make intimate friends with whom they can cooperate in the future long-term development, a core reason why I take it as a positive thing. Ċ However, everything, social media included, has side-effects. Although there exist a sea of advantages of social media, its defects are ignoble. To capture audience attention tightly, the media broadcasts a host of negative reports, resulting in irreversible repercussion to the whole society. Adolescents, who are innocent and naive, often lack experiences to differentiate merits from evils, thus imitating those irresponsible deeds exposed by social media, which produces a devastating consequence. In addition to that, the media can distort the truth by disclosing fake news to manipulate the public which lacks rudimentary critical thinking to judge wrong from right, making unnecessary reverberations. So the social media contains a train of shortcomings. Ċ In conclusion, it is hard to tell whether the advantages of social media outweigh its weaknesses or not. I would hold a view that it is neither detrimental nor helpful to teenagers."
11213,"""A person spends most of his or her time at the workplace, and life becomes meaningless when there is no job satisfaction."" To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?""","Nowadays, job satisfaction is one of the most essential elements of individual well-being. It is believed that job fulfillment renders workers a pointless life that they devote a large amount of time to nine to five jobs. However, I personally assert that there are other factors that are of greater concern than job satisfaction. Ċ It is crystal clear that if amusement cannot be found in their workplaces, it is hard for them to get higher promotions. To illustrate, they are likely to put in poor work performance that is not highly recognized by their boss and co-workers. Another reason is that such long-working hours without job fulfillment can wreak havoc on other aims in their lives. That is to say, limitations in social cycles are unavoidable for those who have occupied work schedules. For instance, it is hard to hang out with new friends and have a company with them, which lessens chronic stresses associated with workloads. Ċ Nevertheless, there are several justifications of the opposite viewpoint that I convinced. Firstly, in today's cut-throat labor market where thousand graduates face unemployment annually, they are more concerned about job security helping them to earn enough money to pay for mortgages, bills and everyday living costs for their families or their own because they have to put family responsibility ahead of their personal benefits. Secondly, working in a prosperous working environment can boost your wrongful mindset about the job. For example, some people decide to go on an unsatisfied job because of their successful colleague giving positive incentives to them. Ċ In conclusion, although some people conquer the statement that those who spend all day at work find life useless due to no satisfaction, I personally believe there are some other aims in life forcing them to keep their job."
11214,Mobile phones have made life easier and anyone can use a mobile phone to answer or make work calls or home calls art any place 7 days a week. Do you think this development has more positive effects or negative effects on the individual and the society,"In the modern world, The technology is upgrade and make life simple such as phone, we used to communicate or answer the office calls and family calls at anytime at anywhere. I think this progress and more positive effect some negative effect. Because it is very comfortable and easy way to learn. However, it's miss used. In the coming paragraphs I will discuss both effects. Ċ Firstly, The mobile is an electronic gadget which makes life easier and more pleasant. Because it helps to communicate anywhere and we learn a lot of things through this electronic device. Furthermore, it improves our relationship, such as a man who live in United kingdom, he makes a call to contact with their relative. Because he do not come, but he makes better way to talk. Although it is the best device to earn money. For instance, nowadays, some people create a channel on YouTube and share their video with other people, it’s also earn money through steaming to sit at home. Ċ Secondly, this electronic media have some negative effects. If we use over mean whole day this phone will be affected on our eyes and mentally healthy. Therefore, some people do not get information through mobile, they used to acquire bad habits. Moreover, it was the cause of some unemployment. For example, before this improvement people used post offices to send their documents but nowadays people use email to send their papers. These facts Make unemployment. Ċ In conclusion, after analysing all the information I reach in my opinion, these developments have more positive effects compare with negative affect."
11215,"In many countries around the world, life expectancy is increasing. Ċ Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this situation and give your own opinion.","Evidence suggests that a growing number of countries experience growth in the length of life. While there are many benefits to this phenomenon, there are some drawbacks to consider. In this essay, both sides will be discussed in detail followed by my own take on the matter. Ċ On the plus side, the advantages of life expectancy are manifold. To begin with, living longer enable the elderly to participate in the labour market and perform social roles such as caring for grandchildren. Simply put, society can use senior citizens experience and their talent. For instance, when a company get in trouble, they can get advice from retired managers or employees because they have more expended knowledge to aid the company to tackle obstacles. In addition, as they live longer, they can spend time doing what they really want like travelling, researching and etc. to discover and understand the true value of life. Ċ However, the downside cannot be ignored. Providing a lot of facilities for old people is demanding. In fact, governments should offer accommodations, recreational facilities and pensions, as a result, the state is more likely to face a shortage of land and resources so that this can bring conflict among people. Moreover, the longer people live the more pain they have to suffer and need to be hospitalized in order to get better treatment. This increases public health care expenditures. As a consequence, governments should allocate more budget on this issue. Ċ In conclusion, increasing life expectancy can be both rewarding and problematic. while they might contribute to boosting the community and gaining more opportunities to experience and learn more things, the elderly are now viewed as a burden on society because they need several facilities and their medical expenses are extremely high so I believe it would be a negative trend."
11216,The topic: Some people believe that children learn better when they are placed in classes with children of similar abilities. Others believe that children learn better when they are in classes with children representing a diverse range of academic abilities. Discuss both views and give your opinion. learning environment for a child,"Some people suppose that the most effective learning way for children is to collaborate with many children of the similar academic levels. Others believe that it is more productive for children to learn with others having a broad diversity of knowledge, which I immensely concur with. Ċ The collaboration with superior friends brings many benefits to children's learing process. They can accquire more knowledge from various fields, which helps advance their self development accademically. As children study with smart peers, they can be able to explore what they are truly concerned about, which is completely good for their future orientation. Additionally, staying in such that good environment will push each kid forward, which is the tremendous source of motivation. Ċ Besides, such a cooperation with other children of the same levels aslo ripes some benefits. Since they stay in a normal environment like others, they will have an easier understanding about what their friends say. Therefore, they might not feel overwhelmed and confused by complicated things. Plus, the curriculum is not very difficult ;so, they do not feel under pressure much. Moreover, they will pick up new things with the ease. Ċ However, I believe that the non-pressure environment does not create many good children. This means that they might not get a large range of knowledge if they are not pressured or motivated by the environment. They can not be the best versions of themselves in academic aspects. Ċ In conclusion, learning in any environment is still good and brings some specific benefits for children. Nevertheless, whether they can be good children or not mostly depends on patience and determination that they put on their learning process."
11217,"Some people think that zoos are all cruel and should be closed down. Others, however, believe that zoos can be useful in protecting wild animals. Ċ Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","Zoos still remain as one of the entertainment options for people. Some assert that they are ruthless towards animals and should be shut down, while others think that they contribute to animal welfare. In my opinion, most of them dreadfully affect animals. Ċ On the one hand, even if I admit that zoos are atrocious and severe to animals, some of them still have benefits. Firstly, they provide animals with food and water supplies so that they do not need to hunt for each other and wander around in order to find water. For instance, when they are in habitat, predators can easily hurt and eat other endangered animals and as a result, they significantly reduce their number. Secondly, some wildlife parks are able to create all necessary conditions for animals’ reproduction. A case in point is zoos in China. Though pandas are threatened and their number has considerably decreased in the last century, zoo employees recently managed to increase their number. Ċ On the other hand, there are many persuasive arguments why zoos should be closed. The first reason to consider is workers' inferior attitude towards animals. Unfortunately, nowadays a lot of animals are punished and beat in order to be tamed. Zoo owners forget about their feelings, cubs, and the fact that they were not born to be caged. Another factor to review is rough and undesirable conditions. Most of the zoos from all over the world provide animals with poor circumstances, such as cages, space limitations, and the lack of habitat. Finally, while it is fun and educational for people, most of the animals feel inconvenient among people staring at them and taking their photographs. Consequently, animals can get furious and pounce on them. Ċ To conclude, all animals should be protected and provided with good conditions. As most of the zoos are cruel to animals and not similar enough to their natural habitat, they should be closed, albeit some of them have great and auspicious conditions."
11218,There is no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Recently, the demands of natural resources have risen dramatically across the world due to population growth. Some people state that we have not enough resources. However, there are some individuals who disagree with this opinion. I agree that we are in scarce of the natural resources to meet the projected economical advancement. In this essay, the issues behind this phenomenon will be examined. Ċ On the one hand, some people state that if the number of natural resources will continue to decrease we cannot have a comfortable life because natural resources are limited. According to a government research in the USA shows that if this situation will continue, the petrol will lose in 2050. Moreover, it is widely said that the number of population in the world will increase. This will make the amount of natural resource decrease. Ċ On the other hand, there are some individuals who disagree with the above-mentioned perception. The demand for natural resources will be lessened owning to improving the technology. For example, the developments of technology such as electronic cars gave a positive impact in the society. By using this, we can decline the consumption of natural resources. Eventually, we will not need natural fuel. In my opinion, decreasing of natural resource is quite crisis, I think the loss of it give a negative impact in the society because even we won’t have a comfortable life any more. Ċ In conclusion, I agree with the idea that there are no longer enough natural resources available for human kind to sustain this situation. In order to defend our lives, the governments should take initiation to tackle this issue and besides that every individual also need to take some responsibility to put hands together with the authorities."
11219,Some parents do not want their children to work part time while in school so that they can concentrate on their studies. Other parents believe their kids should learn to manage study and work duties as this teaches them certain skills they cannot learn at school and therefore better prepares them for the real world Discuss adv and dis of both views Part time job during study or not,"Some parents are unwilling to let their children work during their studies saying the school should be their sole focus, while others encourage their children to balance their studies with work. Both perspectives have their merits and drawback as this essay will demonstrate. Ċ Having a job is beneficial for developing some useful tools such as time management, networking and multitasking skills which are essential for one's career , regardless of the occupational goals. In this way , children learn to balamce their studies and work schedules and will be able to manage career and home live in the future as a result. Take for example working mothers, they do their tasks professionally and still have time to bring up children. Ċ Conversely, focused students are likely to achieve better academic results, thereby securing admission to higher-tier schools. It is because abilities to focus on one thing at time will reflect the ability to complete the task at a higher level of proficiency. Some argued tgat the modern workplaces now demand soft skills, where these children might come up short , unlike their peers who may develop these skills through their interaction with a great variety of people.Yet, as career become increasing specialized, the ability to hone particular skills may ultimately trump sociability. Ċ With the above in mind, it is clear both approaches have positive and negative aspects. While the part time workers may gain multitasking skills, the academic students benefit from a better focus on their task."
11220,question :water is a natural resource which should be always free. governments should ban the sale of bottled water. at what extent do you agree or disagree,"People, all over the world, hunger for a clean safe water since our ecosystem including lakes and rivers is polluted and damaged in a diverse ways. Ċ As such, water, which is a natural resource that should be free in fact, has nowadays become a popular means of commodity. Although it is a basic right for human beings to have free access of water, In my opinion, I do not think it is necessary for governments should ban this practice for the following reasons. Ċ There are people who prefer bottled water over tap water. They may believe that bottled water tastes better than the ordinary one. And also, they might feel healthier when drinking germ-free bottled water, despite the fact that there is hardly any difference between bottled and tap water in terms of quality. Therefore, governments cannot ban this production as long as people, both in developing and developed nations could afford and have a particular choice over this bottled water. Ċ likewise, governments themselves benefitted through this system. Numerous private water companies have been mushrooming than ever before, since many governments do not have enough fund to provide clean and safe water to its civilians. However, it is possible for governments to utilize the money, which has come through taxation on these industries, in a positive way. For example, it can be used for public services like road, health and education system. Therefore, it might be a huge loss for them if they decide to ban this business. Ċ In summary, I would like to argue that governments might not be able to ban bottled water sale, since it is people's choice whether to drink tap water or bottled water. Moreover, there is no need for a government to ban this practice when it itself benefitting through this business."
11221,"Some parents allow their children to live independently, away from home. Other parents don't want their teenage children to live away from them. Which do you think is better & Why?","It is undeniable that every parent has their own style to raise their children. Therefore, the vast majority of parents decided to send their children to other cities or countries to make them an independent individual, whereas, others insist their children to live with them. However, both viewpoints have their own justifications, but I am personally supporting the former viewpoint of parents with the detailed arguments in the following paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, some parents provide the liberty to their children about their choice of spending life and they support their offspring to live their own because they know that beyond the restrictions of their home, their kids could explore the best opportunities of a life and they could find a better job through which they could earn handsome amount of salary which is otherwise impossible if they would stay at their own home. In addition, while living an independent life children learn the various skills such as money management, punctuality. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances of children who live in the abroad countries without their parents and they could easily manage their priorities. Thus, the decision of parents to permit their children to live away from their own place is an absolute imperative. Ċ Conversely, some parents are much concerned, if their children opt to live separately, due to some reasons. As parents are attached to their kids that is why they have a fear of isolation because it is certainly difficult for them to live without their kids and they do not give permission to them to live in their own. In addition, some people think that if they will allow their children to stay away from their house, then they will indulge in a bad company which will spoil their future so they forbid their children from the individuality. For example, according to one research article, in India 60% youngsters have become drug addicts while staying at the hostels and other cities of the country. Overall, due to the emotional attachment and adoption of detrimental habits some parents have a desire to stay with their offsprings. Ċ In conclusion, it is true that everyone has a different perspective about the freedom of the children. As far as I concerned, it is enormously required to provide the freedom to the children to spend their life according to their own way so that they could escape the challenges and cope with the difficulties they may face while staying away from their parents and this decision of parents would be worthwhile in a long term."
11222,Housing shortages in big cities cause great social consequences. Some think only governments action can solve this problem. To what extend do you agree or disagree? concern over housing crisis,"Nowadays overpopulation and crowding of large cities are considered a big problem in the world. In fact, to get a space in the city, needs deep pockets and labourous search to find an ideal place to live in.There are so many reasons closely linked to this issue, Some think that government is a major player in tackling housing crisis. Before explaining my suggestion , l propose a wider range of opinion on the subject matter. Ċ Clearly, increasing density of population correlates to the job opportunities and having livelihood in the big cities. It seems to be one of the biggest factors of having inadequate places to live in. Finding a carefully thought of a solution needed to deal with as so many students coming to study from different countries. They need accomodation to stay in during their period of study. Ċ As far as i am concerned, dealing with this issue needs a great help from government. Providing a wide range of council houses for the dwellers, in the cities are very beneficial to solve the housing shortcome. As well as reacommodating student halls, factories, and large companies to the outskirts of the cities and towns, which generally, influences the expansion of housing for a wider variety of people. Ċ In addition, increasing the price of rent by the house owners should be given a mention. Price cap should at least to be considered to control rent in those affected areas. Also make sure that landlords comply with it. Ċ In conclusion, the concern over housing crises is a ligitimate one. It does need the government support, by allocating a great budget and imposing some rules that can at least steady the housing crisis."
11223,Even more people are interested in wearing fashionable clothes nowadays. Do you think it is a positive or a negative trend?,"Looking fit a modern world, we could find, that majority of people want to wear fashionable clothes. That fact has two sides, and the upcoming essay will discuss both of them before my final verdict. Ċ On the one hand, wearing clothes from fashion stores or from famous designers is not something disgusting or wrong. When someone chooses this way, it is, first of all, always his own deal, and nobody can say that it looks pompous or it is an irrational expense. However, there are some people, who wish to take apparel like this exclusively for the sake of feeling better, than the people around them. Also, there is a type of people, who spend their last money to purchase this vestiture, because society is imposed on them, so they can feel more confident and better, besides, it does not work like this. Ċ On the other hand, clothes from fashion house such as Christian Dior, Versace and Calvin Klein makes humanity a hostage of stores and endless spending. You either buy clothes from a new collection or become unfashionable. This problem is especially relevant among teenagers, since a ""not fashionable"" person may be subject to peer abuse ( many people know firsthand how cruel children and adolescents are). In this case, the only sure way out is clothes from mass markets with approximately the same price. Ċ To sum up, as per my perspective, wearing branded clothes is correct only in the sane community or then the person, who chooses to wear them knows how to defend personal boundaries and comprehends that others should not impute their opinion to him."
11224,"All people should go to university, even if they are not going to use that education In their job. Ċ Do you agree or disagree?","Having a bachelor or a master degree seems to be the majority of employee lives. Some people might think that attending university is one of the significant achievements of your life, even though the knowledge might not be used in the working area. However, in my opinion, I completely disagree that we all have to go to university. Ċ To begin with, nowadays the accessibility of the internet is widespread, compared to the past. There are many online courses on the internet, which cost less expensive and precise our time. It is called freedom, for example, you can choose to study any field you are interested in, there is no limitation. Studying online could also be able to access anytime as you wish. Ċ Furthermore, instead of wasting our precious time on unnecessary study, which might not be used later, it is better to collect more on work experiences in the real world, not just in the theoretical framework. For instance, for developers, the most valuable occupation in the world, the best coding practice for them is not in the classroom, however, it is in the real circumstances. The reason is that when working in the company, they have met with many challenges, which is the time when our brains can develop to solve the problems as many as possible. Ċ To sum up, the educational institution is not always the answer for everyone. With online courses and work experiences, it is not necessary to apply for the university anymore. It is the choice of your life, you can choose whatever you think is the best suited for you."
11225,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? All high school students should be required to have three years of studying a foreign language. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,"I taught basic things about Arabic and English language when I was in high school. In that time, it was very hard for me and other students to learn two foreign languages, but now I am very thankful that my high school made us to learn. Learning foreign language is a skill that not only is very useful for our future college/university study and job but also is a way to learn about other people and cultures in the world. Ċ Learning a new language in high school can be very helpful when traveling to foreign countries or for study aboard. For example, now I like to get my master degree from a university in Europe or America. If I have not learned English in high school, I should study harder for TOEFL. Moreover, because English is an international language, I can travel more easily and with more confidence around the world. Ċ I know for getting many jobs knowing a foreign language is an advantage. For instance, in Canada both French and English are official languages of the country. So learning both languages in high school can make our resume stronger which helps our future job. Ċ Finally, learning a new language means learning about different people and knowing about their culture. In my opinion, it is very exciting to get to know other people by learning the language they speak. Having such experience in high school when we have more free time is very good. Ċ Learning a foreign language gives many opportunities to high school students; although it can be very hard to learn. I have learned Arabic and English when I was in high school and this helps me so much for getting a job and study aboard."
11226,"In most countries, with the widespread of the use of Internet, people have more freedom to choose to work and study at home instead of travelling to work or college. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","Nowadays,our lives have been interacting with the modernity of technology and the internet is one of the prominent factors. Therefore, with the widespread use of the network, people have more spare time to choose the location that they want to perform instead of travelling. The purpose of this article is to justify whether the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Ċ To begin with, there are many colleges that have been approaching technology in term of educating students at the moment. Plus, numerous useful apps can be connected to people via smartphone or laptop generates a convenient environment for international students and workers in order to pursue their work. Since moving is a type of trouble for attendants who are at a far distance to their buildings, however, these issues can be tackled with the help of the online network so that pupils will have more dedication to further on their pedagogical or commission.For example, Google company has been encouraging their staffs to work mobility that means labourers don't have to present themselves at the workplace as long as they are capable to accomplish their tasks. Ċ On the other hand, having such an environment of running can lead to a few complications. Firstly, there will be a lack of proper monitoring which causes a huge impact on human's character. To illustrate, students are presumable to cheat on their examination or the efficiency of a labourer can be deteriorated on the account of working for instance. Moreover, adolescences are expected to be lazy on duties and develop a crummy mindset habit. As a result, there is no one who is fit for trustworthy for a job in future and the effect will bring down one's country reputation. To sum up, this incident can happen if society allows a citizen to depend excessively on the accessibility to the internet gradually. Ċ To conclude, from the contents above, there are countless positive and negative points of manipulating the internet. Nonetheless, from my perspective point of view, I vigorously opine to the idea of the disadvantages are outweighing the advantages in term of internet consuming."
11227,The government should control the internet to reduce cyber-crime and ensure safety of users. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"The increased use of internet has given rise to many serious problems such a cyber bullying, hacking cyber fraud etc. I agree with the notion that, government should take some steps to stop the undue usage of internet. Ċ To begin with, due to easy accessibility of internet, people are finding new ways to commit a crime. There are several fraudulent websites that are meant to hack the personal information of people like bank account details and residential address. Moreover, many people easily get trapped by these deceitful websites and lost their money. Even many internet users get suspicious emails from unknown people. For instance, many times I get emails of winning money and thus they ask me to give my bank information. To save people from such crime, the government should ban such dubious website. Various techniques such as a firewall should be used to monitor the continuous activities of these websites. Ċ In addition, the uncontrolled usage of the internet is making a negative impact on youngsters, many teenagers get addicted to pornographic websites and spoil their life. The Number of adolescents has become the victim of the cyber bullying, which resulted in many cases of suicides. For example, an online game named blue whale, asks children to do some unpleasant tasks that lead to many suicides among the children. So, the youngsters are the future of the country, there safety is the primary thing for us. Government should enforce stringent laws and punishment for cyber bullying. This practice may overcome the misuse of the Internet. Ċ In conclusion, in this era of media and technology, criminals use the internet as an easy source to do crime. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the government to save people's lives by controlling misleading information on the internet."
11228,Some people believe that one-on-one lessons are better for learning while other think that group lessons are superior. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"According to certain people feedbacks given in private for learning is effective, whereas, others ponder that discussions in groups are suitable. In my opinion, I do agree with this notion because both are relevant and imperative to deliver the message as per the requirement. Ċ On the one hand, confidental meetings aid to prevent the conflicts among the workers. To be more precise, there are manifold conversation that needs to be done separately, such as feedback of an employee, sharing a monthly target of a team member, and a salary negotiation. These dialogues are top secret, therefore, the management prefer to debate with them in private. Moreover, in a personal talk the listener and the speaker gets ample time to seek out the issues and reach to the conclusion promptly because there is no third person available to exaggerate the topic. Thus, the focus does not shift to the other side and the integrity of the talk remains trustworthy. Ċ On the other hand, there are multifarious things that cannot be shared alone. Simply stating, in a coaching centre or in a school the teacher prefers to talk about mistakes or questions in front of an entire class, for instance, mathematic equations, scientific formulas, and exam strategies so that students grasp the adequate knowledge and ability to understand the fellow learners doubts as well. Theses learnings develop cognitive skills and take away the shyness of the infants as they learn to speak and answer the question in a mass gathering for their better future. Ċ In conclusion, I profoundly affirm that open discussion and group talks both have different instinct and useful to pass the information according to the necessity."
11229,"The unlimited use of cars may cause many problems. What are those problems? In order to reduce the problems, should we discourage people to use cars?","With the increasing use of cars, many severe problems have arisen, such as air pollution, high energy consumption, car accidents etc. Ċ I think the biggest issue should be air pollution. The air pollution from cars is mainly caused by fuel emissions. Increased cars use causes more greenhouse gases to get emitted into the atmosphere; this traps more and more of the earth's heat, causing an overall warming to the planet's temperature. Since 1850, the eight warmest recorded years have all occurred since 1998. At the same time, fuel emissions such as carbon monoxide have a negative effect on blood and organs of the body. A new survey points out that carbon monoxide basically suffocates a person to death. The gas also intensifies cardiovascular disease in humans. Ċ However, automobiles also bring many benefits to our life. When you have your own car, you can go wherever you want, whenever you want, without being dependent on anyone else. So measures should be taken to solve these problems. For example, we can tap new energy to replace fossil fuel, such as solar energy, wind power, hydropower, etc. Currently, many car makers have rolled out green cars powered by electricity. Though there are lots of drawbacks in this type of car. But I think with the development of technology, these technical difficulties will be worked out. Ċ Additionally, the government should carry out laws to limit car emissions, and advocate pubic transport. I believe that the advantages of cars, in the long run, will outweigh its disadvantages."
11230,"Pollution of air, water and soil has become critical serious in last years and it takes millions of years to recoup. What are the main causes of pollution? Ċ How can we tackle this problem individually and globally?","Nowadays ,air ,water as well as soil pollution is becoming critical serious. It would seem that it needs to spend million years to recoup. There are multiple causes of these issues. And there is much that can be done to tackle the problem constructively. Ċ Firstly ,there are many causes that human beings should consider. For example ,in most industrial countries all around the world where we can see advanced machines or appliances for agriculture ,food production is habitually low_quality because of the lack of useful materials in the soils as a result of creating high contamination levels by lorries and agricultural machines. These commodities are not suitable to eat and they could cause many incurable illnesses. Therefore ,this makes it clear there are numerous causes of contamination that we can not ignore. Ċ Secondly ,apart from persuasive reasons ,there is much that can be conducted to solve the problem effortlessly. For instance ,a possible approach would be for farmers. It means farmers should avoid enriching soil to plant crops. Allowing the environment to follow its own nature rules can tackle the trouble quickly. Another feasible approach would be for governments to ensure that farmers avoid exerting chemical materials that could generate contamination in diverse supplies. These methods are appropriate to create a reduction of pollution. As a result ,it becomes apparent there are many solutions behind each problem that can be performed. Ċ To summarise ,this is true that problems like this will not be solved quickly ,however, this is not a reason to avoid taking action. It is predicted that to assemble humans as well as authorities water , soil and air pollution will not be serious trouble in the near future."
11231,"Some people say that physical education classes are an important part of a child's education. Others believe that it is more important to focus on academics during school time. Ċ discus both these views, and give your opinion.","A majority of people have different views about whether physical education is a critical subject or students should mainly concentrate on academics at school. In my opinion, I strongly agree with both views as each has its own merits. Ċ On the one hand, it is true that pupils need to learn physical education at school. The main reason is that this kind of activity is important for the students' healthy growth and development. For example, students are required to learn how to play sports such as badminton, basketball or football. By doing so, they would get better health and fit body. Also, physical education classes can help students relieve stress and anxiety and even build their social skills. For instance, students who have a hectic school life are already under pressure so playing with friends or outdoor activities might reduce their stress after academic classes. Ċ On the other hand, focusing on academics is truly beneficial to students in several ways. First of all, pupils can gain knowledge from a variety of fields, in particular, Mathematics, History and Economics, etc. Secondly, students who have excellent academic records might have a better future. As an example, they would have great opportunities to find a well-paid job for life. As far as I'm concerned, spending a little time each day being physically active can help children concentrate well on their school works. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that physical education classes can offer several advantages such as healthy growth, development and mental health. However, there are many good points in focusing on academics during school time in terms of widening childrens' knowledge and helping them have a better future."
11232,it is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compare to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is a common perception that when we study for fun we gain more knowledge of how to communicate than individuals who rely on visuals like movies. In my opinion, I completely agree that reading is more beneficial for watching television. This essay will support the argument with proven examples. Ċ Creative thinking is developed by doing intellectual things regularly therefore folks who read interesting books tend to be more versatile in thinking. Also, ardent book readers are usually academicians, that is individuals who want to improve the world by studying and inventing new things. For instance,my university lecturer told me back in the days that he studies an average of ten books in a week. which is a difficult task for most folks. Ċ Subsequently, young adults who grew up studying regularly are more creative in their writing tasks. because as they read they take notes of the languages and vocabularies, they have the tendencies to search for new words they do not understand as they can easily pick up a dictionary to find words and meaning. For example, the Australian education department recent survey shows that there is a sharp decline in year ten student's writing module across the states because students spend a reasonable hour on screen rather than books. Ċ In conclusion, as humans,we should invest our time and energy in reading at lease a book in a day, no matter how small the book is to increase our knowledge power. instead of investing too much time in the screen."
11233,To many parts in the world there is continuous coverage of sports opr television. some believe that this discourages young from taking part discuss both and give your opinion.,"Sports is the precedence of masses and in many realms oh the globe there is ongoing telecast for proper coverage of live sports action.However, many suggest that it discourages young ones to compete in sports whereas others disagree.My dissertation will shed light on both views with suitable examples; shaping my viewpoint at the end. Ċ To commence with, the sports shows are telecasted in order to provide continuation info to million sports fan out there. Due to this, it is often that many individuals leave their practices for enjoying the live-action of there signature players. For instance, it was recorded that during football WorldCup 2016 the training session of every city tumble with 70% and only a few were seen in the playing grounds. Consequently,the attention of young players can be distracted from there subjective physical games as they love to watch big events like world cups. Ċ On contrary,this trend can be highly beneficial as it inspires teenagers to perform better in their respective games. To elaborate, there are a plethora of sports formats especially league which comprises most native and young players, therefore, watching them can surge the motivation among the youth for becoming a sports player. For example, Virat Kohli the captain of Indian cricket team reveals that he grew up watching the great Sachin Tendulkar. So, the question arises, from where the prestige talent would have come? If there was no live streaming. Subsequently, the great performers inspire umpteen infant to rise in their games. Ċ In conclusion, Although, the matches distract the tenants , I believe, this is because there is affection toward te game which ultimately will uplift them to play for there nations, thus it is a positive development."
11234,"[b]this is the topic question: Some people think that the government should offer financial support and care to the elderly, while others think that people should save money for their future life. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion?","Nowadays taking care of elders has become a discussional topic among the whole society. Some people believe that government should be responsible for looking after senior citizens and providing them monetary supports, while others think that individual save money for the future. My view is that these two ideas do not contradict with each other. Ċ The government should pay attention to take care of elders because senior citizens have contributed enough to the society when they were young. The government should spare no effort to improve the living condition after elders retire. To be more specific, the government could establish free nursing home, by doing so, professional staff and equipped facilities could deal with physical condition of the grey generation. Furthermore, if the elderly stay with peers, it may reduce the possibility of being loneliness. Ċ Conversely, individuals should be responsible for saving sufficient money for their future life. This is mainly because the government has limited budget for other purposes. It is unrealistic for the elderly to totally rely on the government's pension which can only cover basic living expense, and then live in an enjoyable life. If senior citizens wish to have a decent twilight years, they must prepare a plan at early stage. Ċ Moreover, family should also be obligated to take care of the elderly. The elderly should be encouraged to live with family, by doing so, it can enhance family intimacy. As a result, they can get rid of loneliness by spending great time with their offspring. Ċ In conclusion, the government should definitely provide financial aid to senior citizens. Meanwhile, individuals should also save up for their retirement. But more importantly, looking after the old is the responsibility of every member of our society."
11235,These days noise and air pollution are serious environmental problems. Some people think that air travel is to be blamed. Others believe that we should reduce the number of vehicles on the roads.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.,"It is true that one of the greatest problems that the world is facing today is the environmental problem especially noise and air pollution . Some people argue that these problems are caused by the aviation industry , while others claim that the high number of cars that running on the road is the major cause . In my opinion, I take the view that the increasing of using cars remain the main source of this problem . Ċ On the one hand , there are some reasons that why people believe that air travel has harmful consequences on the environment. Firstly, since air travel became more affordable in recent decades, the number of flights around the globe has increased . Furthermore, flying is by far the most greenhouse-gas-intensive transportation mode. For example, one environmental scientist claimed that a transatlantic flight can create as large a carbon footprint . Additionally, aeroplane engines are extremely loud, and persons who live close to airports are exposed to constant engine noises that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, hearing loss and stress, according to studies. Ċ On the other hand, those who hold the view that the high volume of autos on the road is responsible make valid points as well. A recently published study indicated that in 2015, 74% of all transport emissions were from road transport. This has resulted in a number of health-related issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular problems, as well as exacerbating pre-existing conditions such as asthma. Likewise, noise pollution like loud, can harm the eardrum, while sustained sounds at a lower volume like vehicular engines can damage the middle ear, with both causing permanent hearing loss. Ċ In conclusion, while both transport types have harmful effects on human health, as far as I am concerned, noise and air pollution caused by cars is a far greater problem because individuals use them more and spend more time in traffic, and therefore, they pose the greater health risk."
11236,"Topic: Whether parents should give money to praise their child for high marks, you agree or disagree parents should give school-age children money for get a high mark(grade) they get in the school.","Every parent always want their children succeed in their life; however, parents have to let their children succeed in school first. In order to let children focus on their study, parents have to use thousand ways to achieve it. But I'm so wondering that is money a good and effective way? Ċ First, I think give money to praise children for high marks will let children focus on money too much. When I was a substitute teacher in elementary school, I saw a boy didn't want to do anything unless he can get some money from their parents or teacher. According that experience, I'm well aware of that money can't make a child good, but it can make a child addict in money at all. From then on, I began to remind parents as I can that not to take money for a tool of praise, otherwise children will take these money for granted. Ċ For all that, I think children still need to get something they really want after excellent performance in school, but not money. Every children want to get some praises form their parents or teachers who are important in their mind. Even adults want to get their boss' praises about their work. Besides, praises can make children more self-confidence. I believe children who are more self-confidence will make more success not only in school, but also in their life. Ċ To sum up, using money to praise children for their high marks is worse than better. Parents should be smart to use some appropriate words as praises to encourage children to focus on pursue their own succeed."
11237,Today school should teach thier student how to suvive finacially in the world today t what extent do you agree or disagree,"In the current era, Financial management should be included in the institution’s curriculum in order to survive in a practical world. Personally, I strongly agree with this statement as pupils would gain large numbers of benefits from economic subjects. Ċ To start with, Nowadays, there are many subjects in school, which are not practical in the exact world, such as mathematic subjects which consist of arithmetic and number theory. Thus, adding financial management skills, which include saving, planning and growing money in the academic syllabus, provides many positive outcomes to individuals at an early stage of their life. For instance, the Srinakarinwirot university demonstration school in Bangkok successfully increased the acknowledgement of finance and awareness of economic issues that could affect them at an adult stage. As a result, those adolescents are seriously concerned about money management. Ċ Furthermore, Financial management is not only teaching about managing money but also gaining knowledge of investment. Investing in cryptocurrency is recently popular in wide ranges of age, especially in adolescents as It easily generates money in either short-term or long-term. However, most people would face a diversity of risks if they lack acknowledgement. Hence, the current school should include that subject in order to avoid losing the quantity of money at an early age and other horrible drawbacks. Ċ In conclusion, Educating younger individuals in academics about money management in daily life allows them to raise their knowledge and awareness, which can generate a bunch of money at a young age by investing in digital currency or other methods."
11238,Some people purchase a home and others rent. Describe benefits of owning a home and renting. Compare and construct the two options and explain which you think be better for overseas students.,"Finding accommodation while study abroad is as important as finding a school for learning. There are various ways that people can select like purchasing a home, renting an apartment, homestay or living in a hall of residence on campus. Each choice has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, for overseas students living in a house off campus, owning a home is better than renting because of cost and relationship. Ċ The first reason that buying a house is better than renting in finance. Whereas, if overseas students purchase, they must to pay once, living in an apartment, they do not. People pay periodically as a month, two months, or three months. Studying in foreign, students will face a new life, there are a variety things that payment. Therefore, personal house is quite luxary and expensive while renting flat is more suitable for students. Ċ Another reason for purchasing a home compared to renting is relationship. Whereas living in a rented apartment, overseas students learn way to live with other people, living in a owning house do not. They meet many people coming from different nations and talk about the culture in their country together. Therefore, undergraduate can communicate better than students who buying a house. In addition, students frequently exchange of learning method, and help each other to progress. Generally, renting a home is a great opportunity to make new friends. Ċ In conclusion, living in a rented apartment is suitable like cheap cost and good relationship for students studying abroad than buying a home."
11239,"It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture Ċ Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology. Ċ However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces. Ċ To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways."
11240,"Increasingly, many young people are deciding to work or study in other countries. Ċ What are the causes of this phenomenon? Ċ Do you think it is a positive or negative situation?","There is an increase in the rate of youth seeking employment or studies in foreign places. I think this is entirely bad for the sending places but good for receiving ones. This essay discusses this position as well as the causes of this phenomenon. Ċ First and foremost, many young people choose to go out because there are no jobs at home and as well as to get better educational opportunities abroad. When local governments do not create employment, it is easier for youthful populations to opt to go out, as in the case of Zimbabwe where unemployment stands at 95 per cent. Secondly, some go out to seek better qualifications, in educational institutions ranked highly in the world. For example, doing a Master's degree in Europe guarantees one a valuable certificate and transcript which can be used to search for rewarding careers. Ċ I think this scenario is totally positive for the receiving nations because they gain skilled talents (in the case of work immigrants), for example, Australia, Canada and New Zealand which have always announced shortages in certain skills. They also gain an improved status for receiving foreigners (in the case of both students and workers). For instance, many universities abroad raise their rankings when they increase the number of international learners. On the other hand, however, it is extremely negative for the sending countries who lose present and future human resources and skills. These foreigners could have developed their own motherlands but were stifled by limited opportunities and went on to be assets for other lands. Ċ In summary, therefore, both pull and push factors are active as causes of migration for young people. I find this outflow of the youth to be both positive, especially for destination areas, and negative, especially for sending societies. This position has been justified in the essay above."
11241,"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Write about the following topic. Ċ It is now possible for scientists and tourists to travel to remote natural Ċ environment, such as the South Pole. Ċ What are advantages and disadvantages of this development? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own Ċ knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 250 words.","Once, travelling to remote natural environments was not possible because of different difficulties associated with transportation, communications and knowledge. However, technological advances have made it possible for people to travel to remote places in the world, such as the South Pole. Ċ First of all, new and cheaper means of transportation have made the South Pole more accessible both to scientists and tourists. Thus, this accessibility carries some disadvantages for the surroundings itself. In fact, the South Pole is a remote, harsh and delicate environment, which has been preserved during centuries thanks to its natural and isolated conditions. Any Increase in the number of visitors of any kind carries out different threats to the ecosystem. For example, the more tourists arrive, the more litter is likely to be thrown in this status. Also, the environment itself has to be altered in order to receive more people. Buildings have to be constructed to foster people coming to visit the South Pole, which implies a disturbance of the biodiversity of this particular ecosystem. Ċ On the contrary, History has shown also that development can bring more benefits than disadvantages when carried out properly. For scientists, being able to investigate remote natural environments, like the South Pole, means that knowledge is expanded. It will help new scientific discoveries to be made and thus broaden our understanding of the world. This development is also a major breakthrough because tourists can visit natural ecosystems that were once only reserved for scientists. It helps them to learn the importance of that particular environment and thus will increase the possibility of taking care of it in the future. Ċ In conclusion, development in travel to remote natural environments has different perspectives and consequences in the ecosystem as a whole. It should be addressed carefully so that no major negative impacts will affect it. Development is crucial for understanding the world we live in, and the way we can protect it for future generations to come."
11242,"Schooling is no more necessary, since more and more information are accessible on the Internet, and student can study just as well at home. To what extent, do you agree or disagree?","Online learning is becoming increasingly popular. A number of the community, believe that the education centre is not important; because a vast variety of research material is available on the websites. So, the students can be educated at their living places as well. In my opinion I completely agree that it is essential for children to learn in education centres rather than browsing on the internet.This essay will discuss why learning in institute is far more effective than doing at home. Ċ To start with, a plethora of people says that learning centres are not essential because e-learning is easily accessible and cost effective. Technology has been flourishing by leaps and bound and provides new avenues while keeping ourselves up-to-date with the latest information. For example, iPad and laptop are easy to carry everywhere around the World and a student can study from different places without going to the school. On the other hand, it is pocket friendly as well, because a parent has the tuition fee only rather than annual academic charges which are mandatory in an academy. Moreover, the children are safer at home. To illustrate this, in this pandemic situation all around the Globe a majority of the children are learning through the distance learning system which is effective and safe for them. Ċ However, there are those that believe to the contrary. They say that education centre is more important and reliable when it comes about application, because many young children are not aware with the pros and cons of an internet. First and the foremost, if the instructor is physically available, they can teach well with expressions and understand how much a child absorbs through their expressions. Therefore, there will be no lack of human empathy. Secondly, these institutes are better in terms of the physical act. For instance, in the COVID-19 pandemic, due to e-learning they are gaining weight by sitting at home. So, as a result chances of obesity will be increased. Ċ In conclusion, this essay discussed the reasons that why using an internet is not more effective than on campus research because of lack of human empathy, no physical activity, and no interaction with the others. In my opinion, I also agree that schooling is far better than learning through the internet because of the above mentioned factors."
11243,"plentiful financial provision for trained sportsmen Some people believe that the salaries paid to professional sportspeople are too high, while others argue that sports salaries are fair. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There is a widely held belief that specialized sport players' income is far too heavily invested in. Others opine that their salary is adequate. Personally, I would argue that both of these stances have their own plus and minus sides. Ċ On the one hand, to some extent, some sportspeople are paid more than what they deserve. Undoubtedly, sports are not the only occupation which requires high payments. Other professions indeed assert sufficient commissions as well, since they make as vital contributions to the society as sports do. Such people as meteorologists, astronomers and researchers all need ample funding to maintain their work conditions. Were sports to be prioritized in investment, other fields would not obtain their satisfactory budget. Hence, the society would suffer from fewer findings and discoveries. Ċ On the other hand, I believe the uplifted salaries spent on experts in sports are justifiable. To begin with, this line of work is a physically demanding and exhausting job. Footballers, boxers,.. are all in need of high salaries in compensation for all the protracted practice and endurance they experience. In addition, intensive sporting is unfailingly involved with occasional injuries. In order to make amends for these sprains as well as hospital cost implications, sport specialists are undoubtedly longing for superb paying conditions. Therefore, the high expenditure on expert sportdoers is understandable. Ċ All in all, I am in favor of the viewpoint that the plentiful financial provision for trained sportsmen is plausible due to their suffering from harsh physical compulsions and frequent body bruises."
11244,"Do you think that a bad student has a bad teacher? Personally, I think the major cause of that problem is a result of a less - than effective teacher. In my essay, I will set out my reasons to explain why. Bad Teacher => Bad Student?","First, pupils are disinterested in school because their teacher cannot get through to them, also is said that, they do not have enough expert knowledge or cannot find an effective way to teach them. Therefore, they gradually brown off, and do not want to do the exercises or learn anything anymore. That makes their scores decrease and the students are underperforming. Ċ Second, when students have to put up with a bad - tempered teacher or they are received offensive remarks from their teachers that lead to emotional disorder. Children live in anxiety that someone will abuse school teacher's power to make them hurt when they go to school resulted in that they are afraid of school and teachers there. They may talk that: ""I hate school"", ""I do not want to go to school"" - there are sign that they have a bad teacher. Ċ However, it is not always true in every circumstance. There are many reasons to make a student worse. A good example of this would be they are lazy to do tasks or assignment, or they are becoming to be a computer addiction. And I believe that a seduce from friends is a big problem that children must be conscious. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that a bad teacher can make students ineffectively than they are used to be. Whatever causes there are, parents and society must pay attention to children and supply them with a well education because children are taking the future into their own hands."
11245,"accepting only well-qualified students to universities? Topic: Many people say that universities should only offer to young students with high marks, others say that they should accept people of all ages, even if they did not do well. Discuss both views and give your own opinions.","A major debate in the field of taking parts in universities revolves around the issue of whether educational institutes should accept well-qualified students or scholars of all ages without assessing their current academic levels. This essay will delve into both viewpoints and voice my personal opinions. Ċ On the one hand, it is admitted that students with decent marks should be trained by reputed universities. Intellectual personnel such as doctors, lawyers, etc are feted in their countries these days. In addition, these people are lucrative sources of the national budget. American conglomerates exemplify perfectly in this case. Renowned companies have stimulated highly qualified IT workers by attractive salary policies with the aim of competing other firms. Therefore, intellectual students not only benefit their own countries by accelerating national GDP rate but also shelter their families from monetary burdens. Consequently, it is vital for educational authorities to encourage well-performed scholars to pursue higher education. Ċ On the other hand, people should be given the freedom to do what they desire and embarking on universities is not an exception. It is absurd to say that education plays no useful role in the adulthood. The country would extremely benefit if it's citizens decide to learn in universities despite their ages. However, senior learners must be applied to certain training programs provided appropriately by universities. Ċ To conclude, I believe that everyone can freely broaden knowledge by applying to a university in conformity with his or her financial conditions. Notwithstanding, students who capable of affording universities' courses, should not be profitable from national funding for education."
11246,"Nowadays, people get information through news and papers, but meanwhile are uncertain about the truth of these news. Should we believe the journalists?  What qualities should a good journalist or correspondent have? Legit and fake stories","Today, mass media provide a lot of information for society through newspapers and electronic news yet the validity is still doubted. This essay will discuss about how far people can trust the journalists and what credibility a journalist should have. Ċ It is undeniable that journalism activity has delivered a vast information to society. However, people should not totally believe the information or news that is delivered by journalists. It is because today there are a lot of competition among those journalistic workers to reach the best rating view or to be the fastest to provide news. Because of the competition, they then tend to do everything including manipulating the data to make the information sound more sensational or delivering the information as fast as they can without doing deep observation and interview to ensure the validity of the data. It results in the invalidity of the data and information they spread to people. Ċ Every kind of profession requires certain qualities, so does journalism. The fundamental characteristics that journalists should have are being neutral and independent. Journalistic workers should be neutral and should not take a side of any group. By doing so, they can cover both sides and looking at any angles of a phenomenon before presenting it into the news form. Moreover, they should be independent from any pressure and interest of any group so they can be free to report any occurance and fact as it is without intervense from any party. Ċ To conclude, people should clarify the rightness of an information and should not totally trust what journalists report. Furthermore, a good correspondent should have independency and neutrality in accomplishing their task."
11247,It is more important for a building to serve a purpose than to look beautiful. Architects should not worry about producing building as a work of art. Do you agree or disagree ?,"It is commonly believed that buildings should be of utilitarian nature rather than just look appealing to the eyes. However, I believe that in addition, to meeting the prime purpose which is its functionality, high rises ought to be attractive as well. If both approaches go hand with hand, we can reap the benefits of both. Ċ We usually build a high rise in order to accommodate a lot of people. To achieve this, we must utilize the space effectively and make it more secure so that it can resist the natural calamities. For instance, nowadays, most of the architecture in my country must have to pass various mandatory engineering tests, including the capacity to resist strong winds and minor earthquakes, in order to qualify for residential building. Thus, residential buildings must make use of available space efficiently and must be safe for the tenants. Ċ On the other hand, architecture is very important in modern society because it attracts a lot of visitors . In order to become commercially viable, a hotel must appeal to a lot of potential clients. For example, State of the art architectural designs in Dubai, such as Burj Khalifa, are attracting millions of customers every year. Therefore, commercial structures should exhibit modern art and unique designs in order to stimulate the interest of visitors. Ċ To conclude, while it is believed that modern buildings should be constructed on the principle of utilitarianism, I believed that the outlook of the high rise also plays an important part. I suggest that residential towers should focus more on functionality, but commercial buildings should come up with unique ideas and designs because art and beauty attract the human mind."
11248,Many people are doing their shopping online on the internet nowadays. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of online shopping.,"some groups of humans believe that there is no relation between study and success because they think there are plenty of people who are successful without studying. While this makes sense in some situations, I would argue that the better way lead us to brilliant achievement is learning. Ċ On the one hand, it is possible that talented men can gain good results. Specifically, if you are gifted in a certain field, you can do it well and acquire flying colours, and sometimes it is better than you expected. To illustrate, Bill Gates dropped out of college to pursued his passion. He was interested in computers when he was thirteen and earned his own money by writing COBOL which is a computer programming language, then published his own company by establishing Microsoft and became a millionaire from 1995 to 2014. Ċ On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for everybody to chase their studying then turn into success. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many occupations. For instance, it is impossible to be a doctor, nurse or lawyer in the absence of having the relevant degree. Therefore, students who graduate from university have access to better professional opportunities than others who with fewer certificates. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive. In some cases, there are dozens of applicants apply for one position in a company. Individuals  who do not have qualifications from college will not be able to compete. Ċ To sum up, it is possible that people can acquire flying colours if they are gifted in an area of expertise. However, it is undeniable that study is an important route to success."
11249,"It is right that university graduates should earn more money than less well educated people, but they should pay the full cost of their education. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","When university graduates enter the job market, they expect to be paid more money on average than less educated people. While I believe that graduates deserve good salaries, I disagree with the idea that they should pay the full tuition for their degree courses. Ċ In my opinion, the level of education is the most important contributing factor to the amount of money people earn at work. Educated people have invested time and effort into gaining their qualifications, and are therefore more prepared for work that relies chiefly on knowledge. More importantly, university students develop qualities that will go beyond their specialized knowledge. For example, better educated people are mentally and physically healthier, and they tend to be more productive with better interpersonal skills than those without formal education, making them great assets to the society as whole. I believe that these qualifications will certainly benefit the prospective employers both inside and outside work context. Ċ I would also argue that students should not pay all the cost of university education. Education will be expensive and many young people, especially those from poorer backgrounds, might find it more difficult to go to university if they have to pay. I doubt that student loans could help to overcome this problem, because many students might not like the idea of graduating and having to worry about repaying large loans. Graduates clearly directly receive many benefits form having a university education, higher income being one of them. This means that they will almost certainly pay more income taxes than non-graduates, contributing more to the education of the next generation. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that government should lower the cost of education for all people, and that graduates deserve higher rates of remuneration."
11250,Some people believe that educational qualifications will always bring success in life. Other people say that educational qualifications do not necessarily bring success. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The opinion on whether the educational qualifications bring success in life is divided. Some believe that they definitely do while others think in the opposite way. In my opinion, outstanding results are not likely to be achieved without a decent level of education and this essay will discuss both views. Ċ At first, I would like to consider the opinion I agree with: believing that fundamental learning is crucial in order to become successful. More and more employers are looking for workers who are well-trained and have a wide range of skills. For example, to be employed in leading IT companies, candidates have to go through serious tests which require being proficient in mathematical analysis, statistics, programming, and, surprisingly, creative thinking. So, it is definitely hard to pursue better career opportunities without a solid academic background. Ċ Secondly, let's talk about another side of the argument which says that people do not need certain qualifications to get to success. Of course, some people became wealthy even without finishing school or college, so we can look through their biography to learn how to do that. For instance, many influential entrepreneurs and investors were starting with absolutely nothing using only their own thought up strategies at the beginning. Although educational qualifications strongly affect our results, some different approaches and abilities also should be taken into account. Ċ In conclusion, some people say that everyone should be well-educated to reach ambitious goals, some would say that it is not necessary. I would personally say that special persons will have been learning for all their life and obtain as much intelligence as they can do."
11251,Many cities around the world these days are becoming more and more polluted. Ċ Why is this happening? What solutions can you suggest?,"It is clear that with the rapid industrialization of modern society, pollution is becoming a major concern. With the predominant exploitation of industrial inventions in metropolises, intellectuals opine that the urban environment is becoming more polluted now than ever. The essay will provide detailed arguments and my own suggestions. Ċ To begin, it is evident that the overdependence on personal vehicles contributes significantly to the increase in pollutants in cities. More vehicles in traffic would result in a higher amount of carbon dioxide exhaust, thus having detrimental effects on the urban atmosphere. Furthermore, littering should also be put under equal consideration since it has the potential to cause massive damage. Decomposing organic waste could generate a terrible smell, degrading the quality of life significantly. To clarify, the To Lich river was once a spot for locals to dispose of their waste. As a result, the smell became unbearable, decreasing property value as well as the quality of life. Ċ On the other hand, there still exist numerous solutions in which education is the most optimal. Having a common awareness about the hazardous effects of pollution, citizens would less likely to commit acts such as littering. Moreover, governments should encourage the public to utilize public transports or taxing personal vehicles in order to reduce the number of transports in traffic, thus reducing emissions. Ċ In conclusion, the polluted environment of most cities globally has become a major problem. People should be educated and aware of the possible negative impacts and the state should pass certain laws to be able to limit pollution."
11252,"In some countries, citizens must pay a lot of money in taxes, but education and healthcare are free. Do the advantages of this situation outweigh the disadvantage?","Taxing citizens for socio-economic benefits has been an age-old debate. In a number of countries, society has to incur taxes in return for free healthcare and education. This essay will highlight why this is a viable approach. Ċ To begin with, there is a school of thought that people should not be taxed for education and medical benefits. This is because ,in many countries, the government-run hospitals and education institutions lack the basic infrastructure and the technology required to provide the necessary services. For example, in a developing country like India, primary schools and state-run medical centres are not world-class, and therefore, people prefer themselves being treated at private hospitals and enrol their children in international schools. Hence, not being equipped with state of the art facilities, constitute a major obstacle to such a tax-benefit system. Ċ On the other hand, many believe that every child deserves elementary schooling free of cost irrespective of their financial status. Thus, charging citizens universally for providing their children with quality education, has been one of the major lucrative socio-economic policies that have been adopted by the government in developed countries across the world. Furthermore, with an ever-increasing cost of health expenses, it becomes crucial that government provides its citizens with a sense of security by covering the cost of their well-being. For instance, countries like Canada and Germany that rank high on the human development index have done this. Thus, the right to universal education and a sense of social security is required for all and must be incurred by the government expenditure without any bias. Ċ To conclude, I strongly believe that the benefits of a tax system that provides free education and healthcare for all, far outweigh the drawbacks and is a feasible modus operandi that all developing nations should look at eventually."
11253,Topic: some people argue that immigrants should adopt the local culture when immigrating to a new country. An alternative view is that they can adapt to a new environment by establishing a minority community. Discuss these two views and give your opinion.,"Globalization has incurred the high mobility of population from one country to another. Those new migrants are at a crossroad whether to blend themselves into the mainstream environment or to establish a ghetto which bears their own flavor. In this essay, the merits of these two options will be explored. Ċ When an immigrant steps on a foreign land, the first priority is to seek a job to secure his survival. Immerging himself into local environment will enhance the employability. Although the majority of the migrants are well educated in their motherland, the level of their English remains the level of international English. They still have difficulties in comprehending the implied meanings of local residents. However, Frequent interactions with the local residents help newcomers learn more about the local values and thinking patterns, thus, expand the social network and increase the likelihood of being employed. Ċ Blending into local society is not only conducive to maintain the competitive edge of immigrants, but also preserve the psychological wellbeing of them. Migrants tend to feel alienated if they are marginalized by the mainstream community. So many unintentional and unnecessary frictions or even conflicts that those migrants become depressed and unmotivated, which would exert a negative effect on their study or work. Ċ However, setting up a minority group which only embraces people of the same nationality or even ethical backgrounds would boost the self- identity. Living in those ghettos, those immigrants feel at ease and a sense of belonging instead of being repelled. Through contacts with compatriots, those new comers could alleviate the depression that caused by cultural shock. Ċ In a nutshell, integrating into local communities would secure an immigrant' employment and maintain the psychological well-being. Meanwhile, establishing a minority group would encourage them to retrieve self-identity and therefore, these two approached are advisable."
11254,Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.,"Personally, I prefer to try new things and take risks. I think that all people want to success in life. They must work hard and gain knowledge and experience. Moreover, when people do things they already do well, they must improve their knowledge.. I base my statement on the following points. Ċ Some of people who want to be success must constant to improve their knowledge and get good experience. Furthermore, they must try to do the best at their job. Therefore, they need to try new things, take risks sometimes and work hard. It is impossible to live without trying new things. For example, I want to drive motorcycle but I cannot to do it. So, I must learn methods of use motorcycle and must now about driving rules. Ċ Additionally, I people need changes make our lives more beautiful and exiting. We find out new things, learn new things and dream to know other things. People need challenges because can make to become stronger. Ċ To sum up, I believe that people is aspiration for learning new things. It is the main reason the way we live now. People make many discoveries and inventions that make our lives easier, happier and longer."
11255,Advertising encourages consumers to buy in quantity rather than promoting quality. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"In today’s world, the advertisement industry holds a significant place in the marketing world. I completely agree with the notion that these commercials compelled buyers to purchase in large amounts instead of focusing on its features. Ċ In this social media era, every person consumes content and wants to buy goods that his or her favourite Instagram influencer is using. Consequently, brands target these creators to do publicity for them and provide massive discounts on purchases. These Instagrammers request their followers to necessarily buy that particular thing as it is a great deal. Pupils get trapped in these offers and bought products without checking their quality. For example, a friend of mine is a huge fan of a YouTuber. This creator recommended a particular shampoo on his channel. As she was facing a hair loss problem, she bought it. When she uses it, the shampoo has an adverse effect on her hair. Ċ Moreover, these advertisers always come with the idea of bumper sales and provide a great deal if it exceeds a certain monetary limit. These limits forced individuals to do shopping in excess even if they don’t need that item. Furthermore, this can create a habit of unnecessary purchasing in people. For instance, I bought one jacket extra so that I can have an additional off on my purchase. Nevertheless, it has an advantage if you want to have menial goods like handkerchiefs, face wipes, hand towels, etc. at a considerable price. Ċ To conclude, I would like to reiterate my opinion that these advertisements need to do a fact-check when commercializing their commodity. They should remain more focused on its characteristics than advertising an offer on it."
11256,An increasing number of professionals such as doctors and teachers are leaving their own poorer countries to work in developed countries. Ċ What problems does this cause? Ċ What can be done to deal with this situation?,"A large number of Skilled workers such as doctors and teachers from poor nations are relocating to wealthy nations for employment. This essay will discuss the challenges associated with the mass exodus of experts and also expatiate on the ways to mitigate this issue. Ċ To begin, there are some challenges associated with professionals migrating to wealthier nations to work. Firstly, it results in brain drain. In other words, there is a shortage of manpower to carry out tasks in the organization. This is because there is not enough workforce in these parastatals again leading to exhaustion of the individuals remaining. Secondly, the workers are stressed. The staff of the organization will easily come down with sickness as they are overwhelmed with work and not having enough rest. Prolonged exposure to stressors could lead to the development of chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes. Ċ However, these above problems associated with the migration of professionals can be mitigated in a variety of ways. One major way of tackling this issue is to increase remuneration. That is, the salaries of these professionals should be raised. This will give them a reason to remain in their country. Another way is to make the working condition of the hospital and classroom favourable, reducing the stressors. Doing this will further dissuade the experts to remain in their home country. Ċ In conclusion, brain drain and exposure to stressors are some of the issues militating against skilled workers' migration and these challenges can be eradicated if the salaries are increased and the working environment is conducive. Therefore, it is important that the relevant authorities take steps towards ensuring that these problems are properly tackled."
11257,"Some people prefer the same job for a same company, but others like to change jobs frequently. Discuss the both side and give your own preference.","With the economic growth in recent years, while some employees intend to commit the same position in one organisation for a long time, others are keen to explore their possibilities in different enterprises. Generally speaking, the latter practice is more desirable than the former one in the modern society. 49 Ċ It is accepted that individuals who committing an unchanged job for a relatively long period of time gain some benefits. One is that it increases their chances of international promotion. Unlike job-hoppers, loyal employees are usually deemed as the highly skilled and experienced human talent because of their comprehensive understanding of their businesses' operations and administrations. Secondly, staff could obtain a sense of security through a long term service. The reason for this is that they are likely to receive the priority when comes to salary package review and employment contract renewal. 92 Ċ However, there are arguments in favour of changing job regularly. Firstly, job-hopping maximises a higher remuneration possibility and brings a more promising career prospect. Sports professionals, for instance, frequently transfer the clubs they are playing for is an ideal strategy to obtain more opportunities to present in a number of international and well-known competitions. Moreover, if the jobs the candidates are engaging with currently suits neither their personality nor skills or qualification they hold, trying other types of opportunities is a preferred change. As a result, the circumstance destructs their mental soundness and their potentials in other areas. 98 Ċ In conclusion, it is convincing that non job-hoppers enjoy some benefits from long term employment. However, the merits of changing job regularly could be beneficial for employees to maintain a positive career orientation and health well-being."
11258,"Topic: ""Many university students live with their families while others need to live away from home because their universities are in different cities. What are the advantages and disadvantages in both situations? Give your opinion""","Recent statistics shows that there has been a swift ramp-up in the total number of students opting for travelling to foreign universities for pursuing higher education. Unveiling such statistics had raised a matter of concerns among people. Some people think that studying from foreign universities is indispensible for a perfect career. However, others may contend that adolescents staying away from their families during the immature age for a year or two could have detrimental effects on them. Ċ It is no secret that that staying independently allows with an opportunity to experience the real world. In addition, it also imparts many imperative qualities. For instances, one can learn ways to overcome their problems independently or to tackle the complicated situations maturely. Furthermore, it also helps in boosting their confidence level to face the world full-of-challenges. Ċ Moreover, residing in a different country could also provide with an opportunity to explore other's cultures, principles and dogma. Every culture holds its own unique morals and ethics. One can inherit such qualities to become a good human-being. Ċ On the other hand, sending children to a different country can be costly to pocket, which only richer section of the society can afford. For instance, one needs to spend huge money on accommodation, food and travelling plus the costly universities fees. In addition, the fact that parent holds no control on their children due to their independent lifestyle, may provoke children to lose focus from their path and indulge in un-ethical activities or bad habits. Ċ To sum up, I would conclude that benefits of staying in foreign countries to pursue higher education outweigh its disadvantages. Not to neglect that with proper guidance and practising constant touch with their children, parents can make sure that their children stay focus to their goals and mission."
11259,topic: some people believe that a lot of scientific research is a waste of time and money. to what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Some are of the opinion that it is pointless investing time and means in the science industry as most outcomes are improbable. From my perspective, I strongly disagree with this view and will further elaborate in this essay. Ċ It is undeniable that scientific research is counterproductive. Vague as the purposes might be, scientists dedicate themselves to these studies. Some of these research projects may take years to be proven right; however, there is no certainty that a breakthrough will be produced. Moreover, self-proclaimed scientists, whose sole desire is recognition, are inventing impractical products, namely the umbrella shoes or the walking sleeping bag. Ċ Having said that, the science industry has made remarkable progress in unveiling mysteries around the world, which has contributed to enlarge human's understanding. Breakthrough can be elucidated with the supplied knowledge obtained from scientific research; hence an encouragement to allocate for the industry. To illustrate the case, the invention of Kepler Space Telescope has allowed us to broaden our knowledge of the outer space with the confirmation of over 2700 exoplanets. Ċ Furthermore, scientific breakthoughs help facilitating human's life. Over the past few centuries, some discoveries and inventions have marked noteworthy milestones; therefore have made immense contribution in uplifting human society. Without science, treatments to fatal diseases like plague or cancer would not be found and we might never have chance to access the Internet. As a prime example for the case, new avenues to preventing the spread of HIV have been opened thanks to scientists' dedicated studies. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that there are more reason to encourage the allocation of time and funds for the promotion of scientific research. It is predicted that science will continue to play an irreplaceable role in human's quest for knowledge."
11260,"Governments spend millions of dollars each year on their space programmes.Most recently, Mars is the focus of scientists' attention. Some people think this money would be better spent on dealing with problems closer to home. Do you agree or disagree?","Although developing the space programmes indicates that the country which is concerned to space is rich, the government may help people as many as possible if having much money. I agree with the idea that the money should be better spent on dealing with problems closer to home. Ċ Some people argue that the government should use money for welfare. This is because the difference between rich and poor is extending, so it is hard for poor to live in daily life and the power of nation is declining. Administration has the obligation that the difference shrinks and every people can enjoy their life. The United States and the USSR face deficit because of spending money for their space programs too much. Ċ On the other hand, the opponent argue that the government ought to promote developing space programmes. Exploitation is meaningful for people to be rich in the future. In fact, mobile phone is available all over the world because there is satellite in space. Achieving space programmes is helping our daily life. However, the government have to spend money noticing the balance between space programmes and welfare. Ċ In conclusion, I believe it is useful for many people to be spent on dealing with welfare and medical care. Governments should tackle with their space programmes with energy to spare."
11261,"Topic:  In many countries around the world, life expectancy is increasing. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this situation and give your own opinions.","Nowadays, people evolved in a positive way. Many countries witnessed a rise in the human lifespan. Although some advantages of this trend could be seen, in my viewpoint, they are outweighed by the considerable drawbacks. Ċ On the one hand, the growth in life expectancy brings some clear benefits for individuals. Firstly, people who live longer have opportunities to stay with their families and enjoy their relaxed life after many years working hard. They become grandparents and could take care of their children. As a matter of fact, almost children having grandparents be together are better than others at life skills thanks to their experiences gained from the elderly. Moreover, old people could promote relationships among their family members. They are usually considered as family moderator. Ċ On the other hand, lifespan increasing caused many issues for social. One negative effects of rise human lifespans is an aging population that puts burdens on healthcare services such as hospitals and nursing home. These places might face a manpower shortage or run out of money because the elderly often require more frequent and long-term health care. Another disadvantage of this trend is that young people will access less job opportunities due to the people retiring later. If this condition persists, it will lead to more serious consequences. For instance, there are more jobless people preventing the economy growth. Ċ To sum up, there re many benefits that could be seen from the increased human lifespans but the negative effects of this trend, in my perspective,definitely eclipse these benefits."
11262,"The education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However, educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and governments should spend more money on this. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is arguable that the overwhelming majority of nations favour the children apprenticeship rather than mature individuals who are believed that the ruling powers should squander public funds on them. Personally, I strongly disagree with the view since the national future relies on youngsters. Albeit, adults play their role in regional development. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments. Ċ On the one hand, the advancement of a nation depends on how the future generation is trained. In other words, this investment in them is a must since they are the future doctors, engineers, and teachers. For instance, the recent research carried out by the University Zambeze pointed out that the most successful nations throughout the world are those which frittered a significant amount of money on Boys and Girls. As a result, vital regional sectors are equipped with specialized personnel, which helps communities. Furthermore, the best way to guarantee the nation's advancement is undoubtedly through education on children. Ċ On the other hand, adults are also part of the republic's development. The role is to transmit the experience to the younger generation in different spheres of knowledge such as education, pharmaceutical, industry, and security. Moreover, it is their duty to secure a peaceful transition from one generation to another. For example, in African countries, despite the majority of local adults being illiterate, they are vitally transmitting their past livings to young ones. Consequently, Boys and Girls are prepared in an earlier stage to take charge tomorrow. Ċ In conclusion, notwithstanding the pivotal role mature people play in society, it is meaningless to spend a huge amount of money on them. However, equal action on children is justified because they are guarantors of the country's amelioration. Therefore, I still strongly disagree with the statement."
11263,Education is of great importance to the development of individuals and well-being of the societies. What should education consist of to fulfill these functions?,"As we all know, education is significant to an individual's future career and will benefit the societies. Therefore, what fundamental aspects that education should include to fulfill these functions is worth discussing. Ċ In my opinion, the very basic aspect of education is academic knowledge. For instance, the reading comprehension ability is of vital importance through out a person's life, especially in this modern society. If can not read, one may be cheated by some false news that one heard of. Even though an individual can read, but if can not understand the reading materials correctly, he may misinterperate the information which is very important to his daily life. So lacking of reading ability may cause inconvenience to individuals' life. Ċ Another basic aspect of education is social skills. After leaving schools, good social skills may benefit a person in their working life. Because good social skills give a person the ability to know what to say in any situition and be a type of person others love to be around. Thus, a person may find less difficult in working with others especially those who are not very easy-going and more effective when in a cooperation for he or she can do a very good interaction with his or her partners. Ċ On top of that, there are still several other fundamental components of education. For example, appreciation of art and literature which can make a person's life more colorful; a perfect skill to get a good job with a good pay; citizenship and community responsibility which everybody should take; physical and emotional health which provide a person with fit body to live and work, etc.. Ċ All in all, education should contain a variety of contents to produce educated people. And with a number of well educated people, our social development will become better and better."
11264,Topic :  A lot of entertainment stars have had the problem of drug dependency before they become famous. Do you think that those people have bad effects on children?,"Many media celebrities , who have been seriously involved in drug dependency , allegedly exert negative implications on youth generation , especially adolescent fans . Personally ,I am out of accord with the aforementioned conception and will attempt to investigate both negative and positive influences of notable individuals in this essay. Ċ Foremost , there are ample evidence indicate the negative effects . In the contemporary society , young people normally show propensity to imitate significantly the famous individuals without any consideration about their history . These over-reverence could be precursor for these immature fans to change their pattern of lifestyle or trend of fashion so as to be alike with idols .Thus,the prominent repercussions worth mentioning are propagating the adolescents with negative drug scandals or misled,biased information about drugs . Under several circumstances , these celebrities , hence , would be predominant culprits,which catalyse rising incidences of drugs dealers , and facilitate this debatable crimes burgeon.If it wasn't for any mechanism supported from parents and authority, they would encounter numerous obstacles to cope with this issues. Ċ In contrast , majority of notable individuals have outperformed after being involved in drug dependency . These people not only help regulatory bodies to eradicate rampant spread of drugs but also host indispensable position in diffusing right perspective . Celebrities , who have suffered from drugs detrimental effects , would make more appealing speech about the health deterioration , exponential hazards rooted from drug usage . Moreover , they could bring more pragmatic value and absolutely be a great role models for youth generation to imitate . Ċ As outlined previously , there are myriad of factors potentially contribute to the affection ,both associated benefits and considerable drawbacks need to be brought into consideration."
11265,Some people prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day’s work. Others prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.,"The majority of the masses choose to wake up before the usual time and begin the daily work. While others adopt to get up late opportunity in the day and be at work until midnight. In my opinion, I opt for the regular working hours as it is beneficial to strength and wealth. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I shall explain my point of view. Ċ On the one hand, the prevailing habits from many years followed traditionally. Although a portion of people had been following to wake up early in early hours from the bed, intending to markup their day's activities. As a result, it produces a plethora of well-being benefits. Besides that, they are always active for the remaining day as had enough sleep for the day during normal hours. For example, in the rural areas, usually, formers wake up at 5 am in the morning, preparing food for lunchtime. Moreover, they will be doing forming the corp during the sunlight, thus, formers having D Vitamin naturally without spending money. Ċ On the other hand, traditional cultures have been ruled out by the current generation as living in the digital world. In order to, young people spend a vast amount of time at midnight, which causes sleeping disorders to intend to sleep over midnight. Consequently, getting up from bed at mid-day, it affecting their fitness, daily meeting schedules. Therefore, sometimes they are sick without a valid reason. For instance, a recent survey conducted by the Directory of health on people sleeping patterns, report says who had followed the sleep regular times, are hospitalization ratio quite lower than those who aren't. In addition, earning more profits in a year without spending on inevitable expenses. Ċ In conclusion, it was proven that lack of sleep causes illness to the well-being, sometimes it would lead to death. Finally, maintaining a proper healthy diet leads to stronger and strengthy life."
11266,Many people today spend most of their free time at home watching TV series or movies instead of going out. Do You think this is right or wrong ?,"With the advancement in technology, most people barely get time to hang out or to visit nearby places. So, the trend to watch TV at home has been increased by leaps and bound to pass their leisure time. I think that there are both sides of arguments for this fact. In the subsequent paragraphs, I will discuss my belief with relevant examples. Ċ Firstly, in today's modern era, people need to work as possible to survive in this cut-throat competitive market. Hence, they become more workaholic then in past and because of it they hardly get time for outdoor activities, resultantly they turn towards handy items at home like watching TV or playing games on the mobile, etcetera. For example, the person works for 13 to 14 hours including to and fro commuting to the office on weekdays. Certainly, he gets tired of his hectic schedule then how can he think of an outdoor picnic with family on weekends. Ċ Secondly, absolutely it is wrong to seat ideal against TV. There are a plethora of ways to keep individual stamina intake to work an entire week for extended hours. With the enhancement in technology, people become health conscious and they can learn how to maintain work-life balance online. For instance, one gives time to himself or herself for at least an hour per day and utilize this time to do yoga and exercise, he does not need to watch TV for entertainment because daily exercise is the best stress buster. Ċ To conclude, there is a necessity to watch TV in the present time by dint of individual busy schedule. To use the short time for watching TV in free time is helpful but to pass entire free time for it is completely worst. So, I opine that individual should cope correctly with their daily routine and make a schedule for their leisure time intelligently."
11267,What historical event in your country has had a major effect on your country? Chinese Civil War influence on the Taiwanese people,"Major historical events have powerful impact to people. These events change the direction of things originally might be, affecting families, causing injuries and deaths, producing happiness and sadness. To me, Chinese Civil War in 1949 had most immense affection of People in Taiwan. There are several reasons I feel this way. Ċ First, the war separated Republic of China (Taiwan) and PRC. The dispute of which country can represent ""China"" continued until PRC successfully replaced ROC's position in UN in 1979. Till now, the tension between two sides and the unclear status of ROC (Taiwan) trouble foreign and economic policy in Taiwan. For example, former President Ma Ying Jio had formed an economic development policy and ease tension in order to facilitate the trade exchange on both sides. However, his predecessor, President Tsai Ying Wen, tried to keep Taiwan's independence, and develop the ""Southern Development Policy,"" which tried to reconstruct the relations with Southeast Asia countries. Politics is not always predictable, but the vague status of Taiwan worsen the situation. Ċ Second, the war kept people in PRC and Taiwan separated and leaded different life. PRC is a communism country, while Taiwan is capitalism; PRC is Autocratic, while Taiwan is democracy. Some soilders followed the KMT army flee to Taiwan in 1949, but they never thought they couldn't go back their homeland again. Most of them get married again, and raised their children like an exiled person. For example, my grandfather is one of these old soilders. When I was a kid, I often see him sit silent and look out of the window, sapping with tears. He told me he misses his family in Mainland. The war not only affect my grandfather, according to the statics from Taiwan government, there are over 5,000,000 KMT soilders moved into Taiwan because of the war. Ċ War itself is a tragedy. We are lucky persons to live in a peace time. Hope this kind of historical event would not happen once again."
11268,"Cycling is more environmentally friendly than other forms of transport. However, it is longer the main form of transport. What are the reasons? What could be done to encourage the use of bicycles among the wider population?","There is no doubt that while cycling is one of the most environmentally friendly means of transport than others, it is, unfortunately, not still a dominant travelling mode. This essay will explore a number of possible factors behind this and suggest some ideas to make this transport widely come into play among popularities. Ċ Of all the various components which lead to the less use of the bicycle, one is its weaknesses in mobility compared to most modern transports. For instance, travelling much faster with moto vehicles and metros are is more convenient for trips within cities while fast-speed trams, planes are more time-saving for long-distance journeys. Furthermore, if people use bikes for main communication vehicles, it may be impossible due to physical health requirements. Ċ In order to promote cycling, the provision of cyclist-friendly facilities might be the first and foremost step to make people make a change. For example, paving cycling lanes on main roads and cycling tracks in public parks is likely to deal with cyclists' safety while they are going through fast-moving vehicles. The second proposition could be the raise of citizens' awareness about the benefits of cycling. For more details, governments can take some healthy policies into account, or frequently hold local or international cycling competitions around the country. As a result, the citizen will gradually decide to adopt this kind of means. Ċ In conclusion, although time-efficiency, conveniences might contribute to the less prevalence of bicycles, safety, and the encouragement of authorities can persuade people to adapt with bicycles."
11269,"International marketing is sometimes seen as invasive and an intrusion into the country in question. Others argue that it is a necessary and economical form of education in addition to spreading ideas, language and culture. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","In the recent decade, the debate regarding international marketing has been raised. Some people see that multicultural marketing is an invasive method in our community. However, Other people claim that it is an essential part of our society in order to gain new ideas, language and culture. I believe that international marketing is an innovation tool and its pros outweigh the cons. Ċ Firstly, some people argue that the new marketing methodology is destroying our society values. As a consequence, we can see more and more teenagers are trying to mimic the western lifestyle. For Example, they are trying to buy the same clothes and shoes, and pay too much attention to materialistic things. In addition, the new international marketing is not considering our national interests. Consider the example of marketing for products that are competitive to our national products. Ċ On the other hand, some people view global marketing as a tool to understand other people cultures and languages. As a result, we will learn more knowledge and skills. Furthermore, we can learn new ideas and innovations in order to implement them in our country. This will enrich our economy. For instance, we can learn more about new construction solutions available in the world market then implement them in our region. Ċ In conclusion, global marketing is a great new marketing strategy, that has a great benefit to our economy. As it gives us an innovative idea to implement in our homeland. Despite, other people claim that it is a threat to our national products as well as to our social values. I believe that international marketing has advantages more than its disadvantages."
11270,Motorised flight is the greatest invention in the modern world. No other invention has influenced our lives more significantly. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Motorised fight, indeed, is an essential invention in recent society. But when people add it a precise title-the greatest invention-in order to emphasis its importance. I wonder that a large majority of opponents will put on a question mark at the end of the title like me. Ċ Time-saving must be an obvious advantage, popping into people's mind. As the accelerated development of the modern world, that time is money has been viewed as one of the golden principles. When the disaster, such as earthquake, takes place, rescuers from home and abroad come to the first site within an hour. Without motorised flight, more lives will pass away when the rescuers struggle in the way. Therefore, it is reasonable for us to admit the importance of motorised flight in the modern world. Ċ On the other hand, we can illustrate lots of inventions that have significantly influenced our lives. Computer should be in the list. We can stay at home and grasp the changeable information in every minute because of Internet. In addition, distance education provides a whole new way of study, breaking the geographical constraint for all kinds of citizens. This change is huge compared with the previous time when a piece of envelop will take up to two weeks to deliver. Ċ To conclude, computer is just an example. So many inventions can be named as the crucial inventions in the modern world as they dramatically change our lives in every minute in terms of study, work and urgent events. It is hard to judge which one is the greatest although there are different degrees among them. But each of them will make difference in various situations. Thus I take the view that it is meaningless to compare the importance of inventions as no one is more superior than the other."
11271,"Nowadays e-books have become widely spread. Some people claim that e-books are bound to oust conventional ones, while others believe that traditional printed books will never be a thing of the past. Discuss both views and express your opinion.","With the advancement of the digital world, e-books become more popular among readers while many still believe the traditional way of reading will not be replaced. In my opinion, while print books have certain attractiveness, digital books will become dominant. Ċ Many people still prefer reading on printed materials because the feeling of reading on papers is much better comparing to doing so on screens. For instance, focusing on monitors for a long time may negatively affect viewers because the blue rays of the screens may make their eyes and brain feel tired. However, when reading on paper, human's eyes do not affect by that so readers may be able to read for a longer period. Furthermore, collecting printed books is a hobby of many because they believe in the long-term value of books. As a result, there is a large number of traditional book readers because they enjoy reading and collecting physic books. Ċ E-books, on the other hand, have some clear benefits when it comes to convenience. Firstly, digital devices like computers, tablets and phones may hold hundreds of books at the same time which makes it much easier for book lovers to read their books anywhere they want. For example, they may enjoy reading while travelling on public transit without having to carry heavy books. Secondly, prices of e-books are much cheaper comparing to physical ones, so owning them cost less. It is because print books need to be produced in many steps. Finally, owning digital books may also make a great impact on the environment as fewer trees are needed to produce print books. Ċ To conclude, both reading physical or digital books have advantages and disadvantages. I believe e-books will be more popular than printed ones in near future because of its great advantages on price and ease of access."
11272,"Topic: Little has been done to prevent animals and plants from dying out, although people have been aware of this problem for a long time. why have people done so little about it? how can we solve this peoblem.","There is a widely held perception in many parts of the world today that biological diversity is in decline. Oddly, though, very few actions have been taken by people to stem this tide. In this essay, I intend to explore the sources of this vicious circle along with some viable solutions to it. Ċ Clearly, the most serious problem problems of endangered species extinction are often felt in rural areas. As a result of over cultivation & deforestation, natural habitats for plants and animals are increasingly axed. Little wonder, they become dying out. Moreover, some famer still hunt endangered animals for money (e.g. selling their fur, organs, bones etc.). Ironically, on one hand, people criticize poor farmers' illicit behaviors. On the other hand, they aspire things like shark fins, ivories. In addition, many endangered species seriously serve no useful purpose to human beings, thus some people simply do not believe we need to protect them. Ċ In order to save endangered species from extinction, I believe we must first address its root causes. Perhaps the most effective method of doing this would be for government to provide financial incentives to rural dwellers, who willingly sacrifice certain farmlands and converting them to suitable habitats for plants and animals. Admittedly, such incentives would probably not fully compensate farmers for the lose income. However, this would at least soften the hardship of living in a shrunken land resources. One further measure would to promote educational campaigns warning people about the seriousness of the reducing biological diversity. Ċ In reality, of course, the challenges that presented in saving endangered species are numerous and complex. Although they are by no means insurmountable, it is highly unlikely that they will be reserved in the foreseeable future."
11273,Teenagers face a lot of difficulties at home and at school. Why are they facing these problems? What can be done to solve them?,"It is observed that teenagers are facing a lot of problems at their homes and educational institutes also. They are facing these difficulties because of their unbalanced lifestyle and communication gap with their parents and teachers. These causes can be solved by guardian and government take different steps. Ċ Young kids are facing multiple problems in their educational life and social life also. These problems are generating due to communication gap or giving extra priority to something. Usually, parents are busy in their work-life and they do not give proper time to kids. Therefore, children keep them busy in other activities which are not good for their physical and mental health. For example, it is noticed that in Asian countries majority children have mental issues by playing online games like Pub G ,GTA and so on. In addition, in schools teachers are given more concentration to frontbenchers or those who good in results they are not interested in weak students. Thus, weaker students face the difficulties to understand the things and they also show a lack of their interest in their studies. Ċ These problems can be solved by different measures which should be taken by parents, school authorities. Firstly, parents should have to do proper check balance of their kids and give them proper time and try to make friendly relation because by this relation young generation share their activities with their parents than it is easy to counsel them for their wrong activities. For instance, Pakistan bans multiple websites and applications which spread negativity among teenagers. Furthermore, schools management should introduce awareness campaigns to help teachers to understand pupil nature and treat them accordingly. Ċ To summarize, teenagers are the future of every country and it is the responsibility of parents and also teachers to guide them in the right way. Do proper checks balance on their activities and spend more time with them. Also, solve their difficulties by sharing their thoughts."
11274,Social media sites like Facebook and Twiter have more negative effects than possitive effects. How much you agree with this opinion and why?,"It is often said that the adverse influence of digital networking is more than positive effects. It would seem that they are harmful. From my point of view ,I completely agree with this idea. I'm going to explain some of the reasons below. Ċ Firstly ,one of the main reasons for this argument is the impact on the human brain. For example ,in today modern world most of the population are exploiting these kinds of applications all the time. They habitually sleep after midnight. This could cause multiple problems that have a negative impact on our brain these troubles are insomnia and the lack of hormones on the brain. This would probably create a dire situation for people who exert these programmes. Therefore ,this makes it clear why social media such as Facebook and Twitter have many detrimental effects on our healthy lifestyle. Ċ Secondly ,another conspicuous problem is suffering from some psycho illnesses that are definitely dangerous for us. For instance ,the community these days are comparing their personal lives to others constantly. This means they decide to have a lifestyle like their followers.This decision could destroy all rules in a person life. There is no denying that if humans couldn't become successful in this way they become isolated and depressed which are the most common mental disorders in 21 century. As a result ,it becomes apparent there are noticeable negative reasons behind each enjoyment. Ċ To summarise ,I strongly agree digital networking and online applications are the most hazardous things on the globe nowadays. Additionally ,the use of them should be reduced. It is predicted that to continue utilizing these applications the population in the world will suffer from incurable mental disorders in the near future."
11275,Finding job satisfaction is considered to be a luxury in many countries. Why do you think that is? Do you think job satisfaction is important?,"Although there is no doubt that job satisfaction is a crucial factor in any company, it is important to consider what is the impact of such a benefit. there are abundant people who think that elating your employees are an inevitable function. Personally, I am a vehement backer of providing the best work environment to employees. Ċ Undoubtedly, the higher employees happiness, the higher revenue companies can earn. This is an advantage because many workers feel that they are getting the appreciation they deserve for their jobs. For instance, according to The Time, 56 % of workers who get appreciated tend to be more productive than others. In other words, staff at the company will be happy and more dedicated to their tasks if they feel that they are working in a healthy atmosphere at the company. Additionally, these luxurious benefits can readily push them to think out of the box, which can lead to sophisticated strategies helping organizations to grow. Ċ Furthermore, corporations should start working and dedicating their budgets to improve their workplaces to seek the best from their employees. For example, Google which is one of the most leading companies aims to satisfy its employees. This happens because they know that the best investment they can do is enriching your workplace, thus you can get enormous results. In contrast, it is obvious that providing a poor work environment, lack of support and lack of listening to your workers can lead to unforeseen results, which definitely will cause a massive loss. Ċ To sum up, there is a numerous plethora of vantage for any company to invest and raise their level of employees' satisfaction. In my opinion, I wholeheartedly agree that it should be a compulsory function in any organization."
11276,"Some people find visiting museums boring as a form of entertainment, while others believe that the role of museums is to educate people, not entertain. Discuss, what is your opinion?","In our world today, there is a wide variety of museums where people can travel to and see differently interesting things. Some people state that visiting museums is only a form of recreation; others disagree, arguing that museums play a role in education. In fact, each of these arguments has its own validity. Ċ Firstly, museums such as art and music can offer people with a wide range of entertainment activities. For example, they often organise traditional music events performed by local or other famous artists that people can attend to and enjoy to some extent. Another point is that many visitors nowadays may choose to come to museums just for pleasure or as one of the activities that they take part in their holiday trips. This, therefore, makes museums a place to entertain in people leisure time. Ċ On the other hand, the establishment of a particular museum like history, science, or oceanography is usually attached to educational purposes. As can be seen, school and university students and teachers are always the guests of museums because the places are where they can discover and obtain a large amount of information related to their studies and teaching. In addition, there are a number of seminars and conferences held at museums that are informative and necessary for scholars and experts in their fields of research. In this way, museums prove the supporting role in human education. Ċ In conclusion, visiting museums is clearly seen as both means of entertainment and education. However, from my viewpoint, people should perceive the value of museums in enhancing their own knowledge about the world they live in."
11277,"Millions of dollars are spent on space research every year. Some people argue that money should be spent on improving living standards on Earth. Do you agree or disagree ? ( In the future, it seems more difficult to live on the Earth. Some people think more money should be spent on other planets to live on, such as Mars. To what extent do you agree or disagree ? )","There is a controversial perspective heating a debate over the fact that whether a wave of money should be allocated in researching the universe or other fields that enhance people’s living standards. From my point of view, I am well convinced that the budget should be divided equally for both aspects. Ċ It is irrefutable that space travelling acts as a precursor to people’s lives. Obviously, the investment in cutting-edge spacecraft along with exploring the galaxy may play a paramount significant role in preventing fatal situations. The breakthrough in satellite design, which may precisely anticipate extreme natural disasters namely the tsunami or earthquake, can be cited as a viable instance. As a result, people may be well-prepared and avoid unmeasured loss of lives and properties. Moreover, it is an undeniable fact that the Earth is constantly running out of resources in order to meet the ever-growing demand of greedy humans. Therefore, by studying space, the scientists accompanied by the astronauts may discover other cosmos such as Mars for the future generations to reside in case the current globe is completely demolished. Ċ However, besides the tremendous redeeming features of funding space learning, it is vital to put money on for others’ aspects, especially education and healthcare. It is a common norm to state that people are settling in a knowledge-based society where degrees are cherished, which means education is one of the immense determinants to one nations’ flourishing. Hence, investing a budget in this category by reducing tuition fees and providing scholarships for children may efficiently produce qualified workforces for a country. What’s more, medical care systems should also be emphasized. Due to the fact that health is one of the measurements deciding a nation’s prosperity, splurging money on buying top-notch machinery for medical purposes may bring a wealth of benefits to people's health conditions. Ċ To sum up, I am of the opinion that not only probing the milky way but other practical fields namely tutoring and medical-related systems should be spent a large amount of coffer on."
11278,"Today increasing number of people, in particular children and teenagers, play video games for fun. In your opinion, do the drawbacks of video games outweigh the benefits? MY ANSWER","Nowadays, more and more people, especially the younger generation tend to spend their leisure time on video games. My view is that this trend can bring more drawbacks than the benefits. Ċ First of all, playing video games makes people stay indoors for a longer time in their daily life. They prefer sitting in front of a screen rather to do sports outside, which is harmful for both their eyesight and physical posture. This unhealthy lifestyle also prevents people from going out with their friends and reduces their non-virtue communication, which is more likely to make people self-centered and lonely. Ċ For young students who are addicted to video games, there is another extreme drawback that it has an adverse impact on their study. Children and teenagers are thought to be less self-controlled, which means that they may spend too much time on the games after school instead of focusing on their homework. Consequently, there can be a drop of their grades. Some teenagers may even lose the opportunity to enter a better university for being distracted their attention by video games. Ċ However, it is true that video games can make people relax, particularly when they are under great pressure of work or study. Living in a modern society, many people have too limited time and energy to go for a concert or read a classical book to relax themselves. By contrast, video games can release their stress in a shorter time and easier way. Ċ Overall, although video games can be a good choice of entertainment, I believe that people are affected by its disadvantages more. They may form an unhealthy lifestyle or get distracted from study when they are young. It is suggested that people should pay more attention to manage their time and restrict which is spent on video games."
11279,More renewable energy sources are harnessed to generate electricity these days. What are disadvantages and advantages of this trend?,"Today, many people rely on utilizing renewable energy in order to produce electricity. While this trend can reduce the number of CO2 released on the atmosphere, such trend also has limited energy production. Ċ It is generally known that a latest method to produce electricity will not contribute to be one of global warming causes. Compared to the unrenewable energy that should be burned first, this energy does not require the technic that hostile environment as it utilizes energy generated by natural resources. A conducted research in United State shows that due to there are many countries that are using this trend, the level of erosion ozone layer decrease 4% during the last 3 semester. Hence, it is clear that by using natural resources, CO2's number that destroy ozone layers are declining. Ċ However, as this is still a developing trend then it only produce less than what conventional system has. The reason for this because renewable energy relies on dynamic weathers that results fickle volume of energy. Besides, there is still lack of experiences how to generate those natural resources that limits people to utilize it well. China has taken advantages through wind power, a national researcher then states that Chinese who live in countryside are still struggling in generating electricity through this method as they have no idea what to do when the wind power ran down. Thus, it proves that this trend still needs to be developed. Ċ In brief, it is a good idea to utilize natural resources besides it can save the earth, it will not be finished as well. However, the disadvantage like small volume production is still faced."
11280,These days couples decide to have children later in their life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? How is it affecting the family life and society?,"In recent decades, there is a phenomenon that couples tend to have their first child five to ten years after their marriage. I personally believe that people nowadays would rather have child as late as possible due to career or other personal considerations as will now be discussed. Ċ Firstly, the cost of raising a child is significantly high and some young couples are not ready to bear the burden yet. Statistics have shown that the expenditure of raising a child to his or her 18s would require more than two hundred thousand US dollars. Therefore, it is the reason why people would like to have children later in their life when they are financially stable. Ċ Secondly, there is a tradeoff between having a baby and career development which is especially faced by many women. Traditionally, the mother role of the child has to devote most of her time to taking care of her daughter or son. This is definitely an obstacle to her career development. When people decide to postpone their plan of pregnancy to 5-10 years, they can take the advantage of this time to get promotion in their careers. Ċ Moreover, some believe that child education is not an easy task. It involves how to maintain a relationship with their child and how to deal with them when conflicts arise. As poor parenting skill may result in deterioration in children's mental development, these people would rather take some time to accumulate more knowledge and parenting skills. Ċ However, people at their late 30s may have various health problems such as infertility that prevent them from being pregnant. Medical studies have indicated that the chance of getting pregnant in their late 30s decreased dramatically compared with their 20s. Although people have different reasons to postpone their plan of having child, they should bear the risks of pregnancy in their late life."
11281,The proliferation of private cars on the roads in many parts of the world has led to serious problems of pollution and may contribute to global warming. Some people think the governments should spend money for the development of public transportation system in order to help alleviate this problem. Others think it is better to spend money for the development of electric types of cars that many cause less pollution.,"The number of private cars today increases significantly, and this can cause pollution everywhere which contributes to global warming. As such, many people recommended that governments should spend much money to improve the quality of public transportation for reducing pollution. However, others believe that it is better to allocate money for developing electric cars that may cause less pollution. Therefore, I personally argue that the government should spend money to develop better public transportation. Ċ To begin, evolving or producing electric cars does not provide the best solution to minimize air pollution around the world. First, this action will cause other problems because the government must invest more much money to produce electric cars. Furthermore, this way also is not effective and efficient to solve the problem since electric cars is not guarantee to protect pollution. This is as the cause of the pollution is not because of types of transportation including electric cars but due to how many people are using it. Ċ However, it is important for the government to spend a significant amount budget for improving the quality of public transportation. For instance, when government develops better public transportation system, automatically there is no doubt for people to use public transportation as much as safe. Thus, people can use public transportation for their activities. Ċ To sum up, it seems to me that the government should spend more money for the development of public transportation than producing electric cars to reduce air pollution around the world. It is imperative that the government should keep control of the use of public transportation and make a good allocation for this action."
