9277,Topic: Some parent believe that learning mathematics at school is redundant and should not be taught while others believe that it should remain a foundational subject whether or not it is used later in life. Discuss both sides . is mathematic still necessary in school syllabus?,"Nowadays whether or not learning mathematics in school become a hot debate topic among parents. Some parents think that the subject ""Mathematics"" is irrelevant to be learned in school. However, other parents opine that it should be a mandatory subject. Both sides of arguments will be further discussed in this essay. Ċ One point of view is that parents believe that mathematics is no longer important and it should be removed as a school subject. They think that it is no longer needed because computer take over tasks which required mathematics skill and it can run the operation very fast in its system. For example,there are computer program like Microsoft Excel can solve complex mathematics equation in few seconds. This is the reason why parents believe that their children should not learn mathematics in school. Ċ In opposite point of view, there are also some parents think that their children should learn mathematics as a learning basic in school althought it might not be used in future. The reason is that, mathematics can help children to think faster because their brain will be always active and also more alert to surrounding. For example, children can realise directly if the change gotten is in wrong amount when they buy something in a shop. They can perform the mathematical calculation directly in their brain without relying on gadgets. Ċ In conclusion, it is still a question mark if mathematics still necessary in school syllabus? Some parents are agree but some parents are not. This essay discussed both point of view, whether mathematics should remain as a school subject."
9278,"Some people believe that technology has made men more sociable, and others think that it has made us less sociable.Discuss both views?","Many people think that the development of technology made individuals, especially men, are more outgoing, whilst others say that it encourages people to be less outgoing. This essay will discuss both perspectives. Ċ The first view is males who believe that the usage of technology drives us to be more sociable. This because the digital matters, such as smartphone and internet connection, enable the smooth communications among society. Also, it can bring an individual closer to each other. For example, we can use dating application to meet someone that you might not know in real-life meetings or it allows us to use a random open chat to socialize with new people with the same hobbies. Therefore, this development can connect the gap between people worldwide. Ċ However, others say that this digital matter changes individual into an anti-social. It might be true because some young males have been so busy with their gadget. For instance, nowadays, guys are more likely to spend their time playing games. It almost takes 12 hours a day, if this occurrence happens in the long-term periods, they will think that they do not need friends because this inanimate object can provide anything they want. In addition, they do not need to deal with their partner's mood, which is a difficult condition in a real-life meeting. Furthermore, most of this group prefer to make friends with their gadgets rather than other human beings. Ċ In conclusion, although some might say that technology can cause an anti-social attitude, the positive impact is more beneficial to maintain a relationship. Thus, as long as we are careful to keep the importance of its function. The positive effect is wholesome for human civilization."
9279,"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Write about the following topic: Ċ Many countries have compulsory military service for young men after they leave school. It would be a good idea for all countries to adopt this system for men, and possibly for women too. Ċ Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience. Ċ Write at least 250 words.","Military service is vital in every country's safety, hence the individuals who contribute to the success of the armed force would be appreciated. However, I do not believe it is a crucial idea to have adolescents getting trained in the military in the early 20s as a mandatory service. It is usually against human rights as up to to the individuals to choose what they want to post their school education. This essay elucidates the pros and cons of the compulsory army job. Ċ Firstly, it could impact the morality of the young generation. Nevertheless, if anyone who belongs to the teenage category is ready to opt for defence work, we should encourage them , albeit forcing every one do so. For instance, in North Korea, military employment is irresistible for both men and women who are right out of school. If we go through the statistics, the youth over there is incredibly disappointed with this approach. Apart from that, the training could lead the children to illegal activities too. Ċ We should always promote peace. For example, whereas Asian nations like Syria, Palestine etc., are trying to expand their military strength exponentially due to their political status there, the rest of the world do not have a situation to attain that. On the other hand, countries can recruit staff to their army service as a normal employment process, and as a consequence, offer them needed training. Ċ To conclude, let us hope that countries would utilise their young minds for their nation-build activities rather than military needs. We are not looking forward to having a country like North Korea and live our lives under utmost fear. Like most of the countries do nowadays, let us stick to the existence of not having a compiled army duty post the school education."
9280,"Present a written argument or case to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic: In some countries, marriages are arranged by the parents but in other cases, people choose their own marriage partner. Discuss both systems.","Marriage is a first step towards the fulfilment of a human's biological purpose. In some countries people are more open towards love marriages whereas others are against the concept of love marriage and believe that in performing them with the permission and agreement of parents. In rest of the essay, I shall discuss advantages and disadvantages of both systems so that they could be understood well. Ċ To begin with, one of the biggest advantages of love marriage is that it frees the parents from their responsibility of choosing life partner for their children. Furthermore, choosing life partners of own choice makes the children responsible. They accept the responsibilities, such as running household matters independently and feeding their own children, happily. On the other hand, arranged marriages involve parent's experiences. In fact they understand their children and its needs so while looking for life partner for their children they keep the nature, likes and dislikes of their children in mind. Parent's understandability and experience eventually can bring exquisite life partner for someone. Ċ These both systems, however, can bring disadvantages too. Love marriage can be a hinder in the way of the happiness of a person if the decision was made emotionally. For example, if immature couple end-up in a marriage by seeing the joy of it, they may suffer for rest of the life. On the other hand, arrange marriages can curse the lives of two families. It is often seen that the arranged marriages that are performed against the will of bride or groom often end in divorce or sometimes worse than this; in suicide. Ċ To summarize, marriage binds two persons in a relationship so the decision must be taken with sensibility. Both systems have their own benefits and drawbacks."
9281,Some people advocate the death penalty for those who committed violent crimes. Others say that capital punishment is unacceptable in contemporary society.Describe the advantages and disadvantages of the death penalty and give your opinion.,"Some people claim that the death sentence should consider for cruel crimes. However, others express that the execution is against the values of modern society. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits and withdrawal of this punishment and give my personal opinion on this matter. Ċ Nowadays many nations believe that they are untouchable and very often break the rules. Nevertheless in many cases problem with breaking the law is rooted in a person's history. Folks who commit many crimes and end up in prison usually have more than 6 traumas. For instance, in the famous movie 'The wisdom of trauma', it has been shown that criminals carry very big emotional language from their past and were previously victims of violence. These people are broken, lost souls, because their experienced many traumas in life. They need psychotherapy and medical care. Ċ On the other hand, it is very difficult to talk about human rights when for example the victim of the violence was a child and was killed in a very cruel way. In this situation following the death sentence seems more than acceptable. Eliminating the person from society might be the best possible solution at first because it can ensure us that this criminal will never again harm anyone. Accepting execution might be a warning sign for those who display criminal tendencies as a result society might be more concerned before abuse take place. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that the death sentence isn't the right solution. Humanity should find a better way to deal with delinquency and approach this issue in a more humanitarian way. In my opinion, we should think about criminals as broken people who experience huge traumas in their life and create a program to educate the population, give mental support and medical care."
9282,Rich countries should allow jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees who are from poor countries. Do you agree or disagree? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The people of the poor or underdeveloped countries are also capable of getting good jobs in rich countries, therefore, they should be allowed to get employments in foreign lands based on their skills and knowledge. I agree with this, however, there are some drawbacks to this context as well. Ċ On the one hand, since the poor countries do not have sufficient opportunities to employ their citizens, rich countries should come to aid in this matter. In other words, poor nations are not capable of creating enough employment for their growing number of population in accordance with their capabilities, thus, developed nations around the world need to hire employees from these areas. To exemplify that, researches have shown that, around 30% of the Nigerian people who got jobs in foreign lands, became able to lead the standard lifestyle in the late '90s. Furthermore, these people who get jobs in the developed cities can send financial support to their families which enhances their lifestyles as well. Ċ On the other hand, it can create a negative impact on the motherlands of the employees who are working in other countries around the world as they settle there. Hence, one can come back to their country after obtaining training from abroad to help their home country by improving it with their knowledge they have earned while living overseas. In addition, they can also create a scope of employment for their unemployed population to help them grow. For instance, at present, most of the students are getting higher education from abroad universities and coming back to help their deprived population. Moreover, the government should also take the necessary steps to create more standard job opportunities for its people. Ċ To conclude, although the rich oversea countries should permit international citizens to work, it is the duty of the government to ensure sufficient qualified employments for its own people according to the skills and training they have to help them prosper in their lives."
9283,Some people think that the only way to judge someone’s success in business is by the amount of money they make. Ċ Is money a true indicator of the success of a business? Ċ In what other way could success in a business be measured?,"In today’s world , it is often argued that successful businessmen have lucrative income from their firms and its profit is a measurement of their Business growth. However, there are other aspects, which will be discussed in this essay, also play an essential role in the booming trade. Ċ One of the main reasons why a successful business is measured by its revenue is that it is directly proportional to the products sold in the market. In other words, economists examine the annual revenue of companies and score their development. To elaborate more, If a company is gaining enough wealth, it means the products are utilised publicly and consumers like it . For example, China has a billion dollars revenue and is considered to be a super economic power. Admittedly, Its corporations diversified worldwide and regardless of their low-quality products, people buy them extensively. Furthermore, a business can grow substantially when it’s high budget allows CEOs to establish branches internationally, advertising its products, hiring well-experienced employees leading to substantial development of firms. These strategies are hardly applicable to low funds. Consequently, money is a real measurement for developing corporations. Ċ On the other hand, several factors contribute to business growth. Firstly, when entrepreneurs manufacture qualitative stocks, there is no complaint. As a consequence, some customers could not be satisfied with the quality of products. Secondly , warranty and return or updating policies significantly increase the customer flow. For instance, Apple company usually replaces old mobile phones with the latest one, that results in customer satisfaction, eventually leading to company growth. Ċ To conclude, high profit is a widespread indicator of a successful corporation; nevertheless, such trade is obviously measured by its quality products and organised policies."
9284,"Levels of youth crime are increasing rapidly in most cities around the world. What are the reasons for this, and what solutions can be suggested? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge.","Recently, it has been observed in our major cities that the level of criminality is on the increase amongst our young ones. This essay is going to present the absence of good role models as the main aetiology, while also suggesting the introduction of rational punishment with appropriate rehabilitative services as the most viable solution to this menace. Ċ Firstly, the acute shortage of positive mentors is one of the main reasons for this problem. We live in a world where bad people, as well as criminals are the most successful when it comes to finance. Therefore, adolescents and young adults view these kind of people as the role model, thus, adopting their law breaking way of life. For example, Derrico a notorious armed robber in Nigeria got his motivations from successful criminals he met in the slum while growing up. But should the government do something about this? Ċ However, hope is not lost because our leaders should institute an adequate reprimand in the form of detention in juvenile homes, and jail time in serious infractions. As a result, this will serve as a deterrent to would be offenders. Moreover, if our youths observe that criminals are being punished severely, they would be discouraged about picking up law breaking endeavours. For instance the Nigerian government was able to reduce teenage drug related infractions, after passing legislation to punish offenders as an adult when arrested. Ċ In conclusion, adolescent and young adults of nowadays are breaking law at an alarming rate due to exposure to bad influences, and thus, this trend can be combated by rational reprimand, in the form of prison, as well as juvenile rehabilitation facilities, so that young ones will be discouraged."
9285,Some people think that new technology always improves the lives of workers. Other people believe that it results in disadvantages for workers. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.,"Technology has flourished by leaps and bounds, and has offered a myriad of benefits for us to use. Some individuals argue that technology enhances the workforce environment, while others think that it is derogatory for the working class. I, however, believe in the former school of thought, but the damages caused by these advancements should not be dismissed. In this essay we shall discuss these two thoughts further. Ċ In the modern world, man has introduced countless invention to ease their life. Innovations like smart phones, air conditioners, televisions, and many more have simplified plenty works for us, for instance, different forms of communication available on a mobile device has made it easier to send documents or messages to family members or colleagues, unlike mail services in the past. Hence, these products have definitely made jobs more efficient and precise. Moreover, another invention is the calculator, which solves millions of mathematical equations are in less than a second, and this has been a massive success for bank professionals, eventually making their task faster and convenient. Overall, all of these upgrades make jobs simpler and accessible. Ċ On the contrary, every rose has its own thorn; consequently, there are some drawbacks caused by these advancements. Firstly, these days jobs are not hectic or tiring anymore, in fact, people have become lousy and irresponsible because of it, for instance, earlier people had to commute to work, whereas now they just have to work from home which has increased loneliness and depression. Furthermore, numerous studies have also linked health problems, such as obesity, heart conditions, vision impairment which is caused by long and constant exposure to computer screens, and some even complained of joint pain. In the end, the effects of these inventions have created some unpredictable damages. Ċ To summarize, technology cuts both ways; therefore, there are various benefits for workers, but there are some setbacks to it. Nevertheless, if everything is in moderation, it shall be well balanced."
9286,"As they grow older, adults often like to think back on their childhood days. Are childhood and primary school days the best times in a person's life? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write At least 250 words","Every individual's life is going in a faster pace, Family time, social life, work and even relaxations or recreation time is quickly happening. People love to traverse through their childhood memories. I consent that childhood and primary school days are best part of our life because it is used to be very simple and happier then now Ċ Albeit, there are few drawbacks being a child. There is no power to take decisions for their own life. Even the clothes they wear are chosen by parents. We can't go out for a trip without parents' permission. Additionally lack of understanding tends to make more mistakes. This occurs due to less knowledge about life and low level of maturity. Ċ Here is the positive side of remaining a child. First and foremost benefit is there are no responsibilities apart from taking care of themselves. It is not case with the parents who are overburdened with their duties leaving no time for themselves, when I was a small kid I used to play a lot. I liked to spend time with my friends playing outdoor games, video games and gossiping on top of that you can sleep as much as you want. Parents force their children to go to bed early whereas during adulthood there is lack of sleep. Most important, children are free birds and there is nothing to worry about and stress free. Ċ Childhood is the most memorable part of our lives. Adults think about their beautiful experience occurred in their childhood. I strongly believe that childhood & primary school days the best times in a person's life."
9287,"supporting tuition by a government In some countries, students have to pay their own college and university fees, but in other countries, government pays this amount. Do the advantages of the government's spending their money on college and university fees for a student outweigh the disadvantages","People have different views about the advantages of the government's expenditure for student's university fees. While in some countries, government expend their money on college and university fees for a student, I personally think that this amount should be paid by students. Ċ On the one hand, I can understand that there are many benefits when government supports education costs for students. This will reduce the financial burden on students, student could only need to focus on learning. This also facilitates higher education's access for many students, especially underprivileged students. In short, government funding for university and college fees could help improve quality of education. Ċ On the other hand, in my view, it is unnecessary when tuition fees are paid by government for all students. When going to school is free, it leads students being lack of responsibility in studying. College students are mature enough to handle their own education costs. Instead of receiving passively government subsidies, they can earn their own money and instead of spending money on helping student's fees, government could provide student loans which will be compensated after graduation. In addition, the governments have more importance concerns. For example, beside education which accounts for a large of amount, the state budgets need to be spent on other areas such as: healthcare, infrastructure and security. Ċ In the final analysis, it is my opinion that the disadvantages of the government's spending their money on college and university fees for a student outweigh the advantages. The government should only support tuition for disadvantaged students, the others have to pay their own."
9288,Traditional food is undergoing great changes and is being replaced by new diet. What do you think are the reasons and what do you think about this phenomenon?,"Traditional food is undergoing great changes and is being replaced by a new diet. The major reason behind it is the modification in people's taste. I personally feel it is the main reason but there are other explanations as well. In the essay, I will explain all the causes concerning the event. In my opinion, I firmly believe that this phenomenon has more negative sides compared to positive ones. Ċ To begin with, the variation in customary cooking is linked to the contrasting choices of people. With time, folks felt the urge to include alteration in their cooking. The findings of new spices and herbs intrigued them to try new and prepare new dishes. Dishes like burgers, pizzas and many more which replaced the long-established ones. The public started preparing meals according to their likings instead of following the conventional ways. For instance, some prefer more spices in their food while others liked savoury or sweet dishes. Therefore, this contrast is what motivated people to try new diets which ultimately replaced the long-established ones. Ċ On the contrary, the divergence in preference is causing customary aliment to disappear. The young generation does not know about their customary cuisines due to modifications. They say, "" Food connects us to our roots"". But since it is being ripped off we are no longer connected. Likewise, it is resulting in young folks being more inclined towards junk diets as that is the aliment they have eaten since forever. According to many reports and news, this event is causing an important part of our heritage to disappear. At the same time promoting bad eating habits. Ċ To conclude, the phenomenon concerning the replacement of conventional meals with a new diet is unacceptable. As mentioned earlier in the essay, I absolutely oppose the occurrence as it has many downfalls compared to the benefits."
9289,Longer life spans and improvements in the health of older people suggest that people over the age of sixty-five can continue to live full and active lives. In the ways can society benefit from the contribution that older people can make?,"Sustaining to live full and active lives in elderly people can be obtained from the breakthrough of health and longer life duration. From such a phenomena, I totally sure that they can contribute to their circumstances. In this essay, I would like to point out two ways in which such people can gain advantages from such an interest, such as involving in family's occasions and consulting group. Ċ Engaging into family's certain event is one of the approaches that old people can give benefits. They can show unique traditional games or sports in particular area for young people. If they love cooking, they may also train how to cook tasteful typical food in such a region. Valuable moral values can also be delivered to people who still do not know about attitude. Those examples are reasonable since they lived in the era that recent people still do not exist. Ċ In addition, becoming involved in consulting association is one of the most beneficial ways. Old people can take into account in such an association based on their education background. According to such a method, some retired people are able to criticize the current politics while others might give several suggestions. Those who have experience about environment also could present great solutions to present-day problems related to their knowledge. Ċ To sum up, cutting-edge health and longer life spans can make old people to pursuing their live fully and actively. While joining consulting affiliation is one of the most appropriate ways, taking on family's exclusive situation is also one of the ways to contribute."
9290,The government should impose a fee on drivers who use their vehicles during rush hour to help cut down on air pollution from exhaust fumes. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"In this day and age, more and more contemporary attention has been placed on whether or not the authorities should charge a fee on drivers who utilize their private transports during rush hour to diminish the rate of air pollution. Although there are a number of people who think that policy is negative, I personally support this opinion for the following reasons. Ċ To begin with, charging fees for driving during peak hours would ease traffic congestion since most commuters will react sensitively to additional financial fees. In particular, this practice acts as an incentive for them to drive cars less often, reducing the number of vehicles on the road. In addition, if punishments are applied, drivers tend to choose the public transports, especially buses and raise their awareness of protecting the environment. As a result, this would bring good effects to air deterioration in terms of reducing smoke from private cars. Ċ On top of that, it is true that imposing extra expense in rush hours facilitates the preservation of the natural environment by using the revenue for the public. For example, in Canada, the fund has been relocated by the government for building public facilities such as parks and zoos. This not only caters to the recreational needs of residents but also boosts the air quality in the long run. Had it not been for this approach, the polluted air would have not been fixed efficiently. Ċ To sum up, there is no doubt that imposing serve taxes to save air environment has proven to be effective. Therefore, I believe that this idea would be beneficial to both the planet and society."
9291,Many people argue that smoking should be banned due to its harmful effects on human health. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Smoking is a common addiction these days. Many experts opine that it should be banned completely due to its detrimental impact on the human body. Personally, I am in consummate accord with the aforementioned statement and the following expository paragraphs will expatiate my stance with lucid examples. Ċ Firstly, it is apparent that smoking can cause deadly diseases in the body of an individual. To elucidate, the perilous smoke can damage the lungs of the person inhaling it and thereby, giving rise to myriad treacherous problems to the health. Nevertheless, even after detection of any malady, the addiction caused can exacerbate it which sometimes leads to death as well. For example, it has been revealed by a survey conducted by oxford university that 70% of smokers are more prone to lung cancer. Therefore, it is indispensable to ban such addictions that act like a worm for the human body. Ċ Moreover, not only smokers but the people in the surroundings also get affected adversely due to the smoke of cigarettes present in the air. Many people,unknowingly, deteriorate their health by inhaling the smoke from somebody else nearby .To illustrate, a teenager might get affected if someone from his family is a smoker and often smokes inside the home. As a result, this habit can put several other people in jeopardy and hence,should be prohibited. Ċ To conclude, the government should take resolute steps to ban smoking immediately. The health of the people is paramount and it is imperative to thwart any kind of habit posing danger to it."
9292,Question. Some people say that outdoor activities bring more benefits to children's development than computers .to what extent do you agree or disagree,"Nevertheless ,Electronic games are the most preferred games in today's Era.a segment of society the believes that field games have better outcomes than computer games. I partially agree with the statement.I want to delve the points in the upcoming paragraphs Ċ To Begin, there are multifarious advantages of playing in the ground. the first of the prominent is that it maintains and helps to increase the overall growth of the pupil's body which include mental abilities inclined in metabolic rate and improve the physical strength. To exemplify outdoor games like cricket develop all the physical and mental skills as a player have to focus on the ball and hit hard to get a strike. in addition,youngsters those who go out to play will Gain social skills. Interacting with new sportsmen will enhance the confidence and ability to learn new strategies with the latest form of practice. THUS, playing outside the room Tends to the overall growth of individual Ċ on the other hand , computerised games also play a vital role in youngsters development. FIRSTLY, playing such games helps to gain cognitive skills of a growing child . And in this virtual era individuals those who are engaged in computer games able to think rapidly and develop their own strategies .for instance,playing games such as rapid-fire and battlegrounds which improve the capability of thinking that how to respond for the reaction. furthermore, playing games on computer foster social and Team relationships. inviting new friends on social platform enables them to gain new friends.To exemplify, defeating the opposite team with the support of whole teammates makes the internal satisfaction and team spirit Ċ In conclusion, looking at the broad side of the coin. it concludes that both electronic and outdoor games have their own place in an individual's life."
9293,"Topic: Today, newspapers and televisions are giving detailed descriptions of crimes. Some people believe such a practice will cause bad consequences and thus media should be restricted. To what extent do you agree or disagree? news restriction","Nowadays, many news platforms are broadcasting details of criminal incidents; although detailed descriptions can bring more awareness of crimes, I am convinced it should be restricted since it would cause detrimental effects. Ċ Many medias delivered criminal scenes to audiences detailedly to make their news more attractive, people tend to be curious and would want to know it better. Since they pay attention on the news context, they would know what exactly the crimes were. This can make residents realize what kind of criminal might happen around them. As a result, local residents would be aware of similar conditions, and prevent themselves from being harm as the news described. For instance, last year in Taiwan, a secondary school student saved herself from a severe rubbery because she saw an informative news about the same kind of crime. However, I believe other methods can be applied to make citizens be more careful of local crimes, such as educating residents, rather than letting newspapers and televisions to tell the details of those tragics. Ċ While knowing a news in detail can bring up awareness to prevent some crime, several drawbacks cannot be forgotten. From my point of view, detrimental effects are significant if medias can describe any crime without discipline. Violence and other horrible photos on news should be restricted, because it may affect individual's mental health, which, by researches, would be extremely harmful to children. Except for people having fear, some are likely to learn and mimic the crime. Therefore, such context of news should be forbidden by governments, especially to families with children. Ċ In conclusion, for the reasons above, despite it can make people more aware of crime, I believe it may be preferable to restrict that overdetailed news."
9294,Hello parents complain about violence promoted to their children Through video games TV programs and other media why is this happening what can you do the solution for it?,"Evidence shows that a growing number of parents are concerned about the violence promoted through entertainment programs to their children. there is a number of problems involved with this trend and it is crucial to find and tackle them. Ċ there are two main reasons behind this trend. Firstly, Youngsters do not have many outside activities like past, so they spend most of their time playing electronic call games and social media. Due to the modernization of architecture, modern houses do not have enough outdoor spaces for children to go out and play football, for example. Moreover, instead of going ,outAdd a comma,outIt appears that you are missing a comma after the introductory phrase instead of going ,out. Consider adding a comma. Ċ show examples they choose violent games which are much more attractive to entertain themselves during leisure time. Simply put, to tackle the problem government should build more suitable centres for teenagers to attract them to spend their time playing and studying together. A good illustration of this is in Canada, every district in Ontario has a public club in which parents and children can enjoy dance classes, art sections, music and even a library. Ċ Second of all, there are other concerns like Weiland movies and video Clips which attract viewers drastically. To begin with, viewers may be encouraged to do the same thing in real life when they watch wild shows such as freestyle wrestling or action movies. To solve these kinds of problems parents should use safety measures to track kids phone or TV accounts in order to censor the contents not suitable for their age. As an example, applications like pub G or boxing should be banned or restricted. In other words, children should be allowed to a certain media. Ċ To conclude, offspring Are afflicted by games and media, however, it is their guardians' job to protect them from violence. It seems to me that parents play an integral role in this matter, they should lead a healthy life in a positive atmosphere and save youngsters from the trap of threats posed by media and video games."
9295,"Question: Nowadays, children play computer games for long hours and they do not play old traditional games. What do you think is the reason? Do you think this influences children in a good or a bad way? Answer:","Technology revolution result in daily new computer games is introduced in the market. Playing computer games is very interesting for child and makes them to play for long hours than historical games. In my point of view though it has some benefit but continuous playing leads to a bad way of life. Ċ Apparently, computer games is better leisure activity which motivates and gives self confidence for children to achieve their goals. It improves creativity among children. It enables children to dedicate their valuable time. It makes children to be adventurous and make them to be courageous to face any problem in their life. It improves their concentration. Playing games help children who are ill divert them from their pain and discomfort. Ċ On the other hand, children are addicted towards the computer games which distract their studies. Playing for many hours make children to be obese. Due to its attractiveness make children to avoid their traditional games. Continuous playing results in psychological problem among children. Some games influence violence in the children. For example, a report says that children who playing shooting games influence them to test it in real time situation and many cases are reported around the world. Due to attractiveness of computer games produce traditional games are diminishing. Ċ In a nutshell, though playing computer games have some advantages it affects children. It diverts children to forget their traditional games. Let's motivates children to play their traditional games to make them to be fit and respect their culture and tradition."
9296,"Some people view teenage conflict with their parents as a necessary part of growing Ċ up, whilst others see it as something negative which should be avoided. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There is no doubt that adolescence can be a difficult period for both youngsters and their parents. Although some people believe that conflict at this time does more harm than good, I would argue otherwise, the reason being it would play an essential role in turning them into mature. Ċ On the one hand, those who believe adolescent arguments can break the trust between the children and their parents. This is because such disputes will often result in misunderstandings amongst the families. For example, it is quite common for youngsters to indulge in wrongdoings to impress their peers, but the results of it would bring confrontations with parents which in turn can create communication gaps in future. In contrast, if that is avoided then there will be a much greater sense of happiness among family members. Ċ On the other hand, my impression is that these conflicts are vital because they will help teenagers to take their own stand and help them mature. For instance, a child may grow up in a family of doctors but he is completely against becoming one.If they don't voice out their interest, they will be going against their dreams.Nonetheless, if they are willing to engage in clashes with their parents, their conscience will be much clearer despite the agony of the argument. Ċ In conclusion, in spite of the harmony of the relationship being damaged, I firmly believe that this friction is a crucial step on the path to the development of maturity and independent thinking in adolescents."
9297,"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantages of this overweight the disadvantages?","Education is the fundamental building block for children’s development, and the growth of students is very much dependent on the way of coaching. Some prefer educating students at home while others think it is necessary for children to attend schools. However, I am in favour of regular schooling because it is more beneficial for their overall development and prepares them for their future. Ċ On the one hand, there are groups of people who consider homeschooling has many benefits for the child’s growth. For instance, a student studying at home can get personal attention from parents, which result in good academic results. Furthermore, parents are aware of their child’s weakness and can help him to cope with difficulties. Thus, it can be said that children can learn their subjects at the pace in which they are comfortable, and this can help them to excel in studies. Ċ On the other hand, many consider schools as the required element in student growth. Educational institutions, for example, concentrate on teaching moral values like tolerance and sharing along with studies. Moreover, children are encouraged to perform tasks in a team, enabling them to learn teamwork and not to dishearten by failure. Therefore, the chances of suffering from depression are reduced to a greater extent in case he doesn’t get what he desired in the real world. Finally, school can provide a wide range of up to date educational resources, and well-trained teachers can guarantee the high quality of education. Ċ In conclusion, it can be seen that both the viewpoints have their own merits. Nevertheless, I tend to believe that in order to sustain in the actual world, students should be motivated to get educated in institutions rather than learning alone at home. It is thus hoped that the government will enforce strict laws for attendance in school compulsory."
9298,People who buy friendly vehicles like electric cars should receive a subsidy on tax. This will discourage people from buying polluting cars and thus lower emissions. Ċ Do you agree or disagree with the statement?,"It is often argued that special waive-off on taxes should be for individuals using eco-friendly vehicles. I strongly believe,Remove the commaapplyIt appears that you have an unnecessary comma between the verb and object in your sentence. Consider removing it. Ċ show examples that this scheme could encourage the public to buy these cars with electric engines. Firstly, we will examine how it will be advantageous for our environment and secondly, we will discuss how it will be cost-effective. Ċ To begin with, these environmentally friendly cars will help us to reduce the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which will improve the quality of the air we breathe in. For example, with the improvement of air quality, we can alleviate the problems faced by many individuals related to breathing. In addition to this, we can diminish the overuse of natural resources used by humans. To further explain, there is a tremendous strain on the petroleum resources nowadays and by replacing our automobiles we can help restore the level of natural resources. Ċ Furthermore, the trend of using electrical cars will help us to curb the issue of rising petrol and diesel prices. To elaborate, the source of energy like electricity is renewable and cost-effective, thus opting for these cars will prove to be economical. For instance, units of energy consumed by an electric car are way less costly than the petrol combusted by a petrol car for the same travelling distance. Additionally, with the decline of the health issues by enhancing the air quality, medical expenses in communities will drop, hence easing the financial burden on people. Ċ In conclusion, government bodies should introduce the subsidy schemes to provoke citizens for shifting to electric cars, which in turn will help us to combat the global issues relating air pollution and natural resource depletion, as well as elevating oil expenses and deteriorating medical issues and so on."
9299,"The government should ban smoking in all public places, even though this would restrict one's freedoms. Ċ Do you agree or disagree.","It is clear that the consumption of cigarettes in public locations is following an incremental trend. There is dissension that politics should forbid smoking if it is possible in the community, while others disagree with this and claim that this would restrict one's freedoms. There are valid opinions on both sides, which I will now consider. Ċ On the one hand, smoking is an agent that causes a multifarious number of negative consequences for one's health. A great deal of research demonstrates that a cigarette involves an extensive number of chemicals and gases which are damaging to his lungs, such as nicotine, heroin etc. These toxins may cause a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which is the condition of lung's respiratory limitations without any cure at the moment. Moreover, this is not only causing harm to the ones who directly smoke, however smoking in the free locations where people can gather, are under the dreadful impact as well. Ċ On the other hand, a certain amount of the individuals tends to opine that if the ministry embargoes smoking in public places, it will signify that they restricted their liberty. Furthermore, there are several grounds why human beings start to smoke. First and foremost, the stress that a person received from the daily routine and problems that follow him during a certain period. As a result, will provide a miserable mood and in order to alter this condition, some people start to smoke nevertheless they realise the consequences and detriment that they drift. For instance, to themselves and people surrounding them. Ċ To sum up, from my point of view, the government should ban smoking for all national population’s health and international environment. Even though this may restrict ones’ freedoms, the benefits of this are far higher than its disadvantages."
9300,Governments should fund scientific research rather than commercial organizations. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement.,"It is often argued that investing in scientific progress is more beneficial than funding business industries . In my opinion , I completely agree with this view and think that priority should be given to science. Ċ Firstly, scientific researchers help society to find a solution to existing problems which have a direct impact on human beings and their surroundings . In other words , if the nation 's authority invests more in science , it will undoubtedly show a huge improvement and development in several sectors. As a result, it has become a developed country and has the ability to face many problems . For example , the vaccine of the virus Covid-19 was developed by researchers and not by commercial persons and therefore they protect the whole world from the adverse effects of this epidemic . That is why science is a more advantageous field and provides many benefits to the community . Ċ Secondly, scientific progress helps individuals to feel more secure in the community . To put it simply , when authority funds research activities, there is most security. They do not disclose any information which could hamper national security. thus , investigation and development in the field of the military are carried out by the union. Ċ Finally , the regime will be capable of providing financial assistance to various analysis projects. For instance , if the project fails to achieve its objectives, the government has the resources to cope up with the losses incurred . Ċ In conclusion , despite the importance of commercial sectors, I strongly believe that the government should invest in scientific research because it provides several benefits to humans and society."
9301,Some parents say that children should play individually more than in a group. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"Playing for children plays a significant role in their development. While I admit that there are a couple of benefits to playing alone for children, I believe that it is more likely to have drawbacks. Ċ On the other hand, it is true that playing solitary for children carries some benefits. The main advantage is that they can develop their concentration skills. When children play by themselves there is less distraction from other people, which enhances to work on one task for a period of time. As a result, this skill can be useful when children take entrance examinations and working places in the future. In addition, playing alone for children also grows their imagination. Since children image their works during doing solitary activities such as drawing and assembling blocks, these types of play exercise children’s imagination. Ċ On the other hand, I believe that the drawbacks of playing solitary for children exceed its benefits. Firstly, when children play individually, they cannot gain social skills. This is because children do not have opportunities to interact with others in order to learn social skills such as negotiation and cooperation. Consequently, as they reach adulthood, children will have trouble collaborating with other individuals including their colleagues. Furthermore, children’s personality will become self-centred. Since children do not experience arguing or accomplish with other people through group activities, they are always doing as they please, which create the people who do not care about others. Ċ In conclusion, although it is true that there are positive aspects with playing alone for children, in my opinion, the disadvantages of this way of playing outweigh the advantages when considering that concentration skill and imagination can be acquired by other activities aside from playing but children can only learn social skills from play with others."
9302,Team activities can teach more skills for life than those activities which are played alone. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is clear that the recent debate on whether or not school children should be given homework does not seem to come to an end any time soon. Although some may argue that the setting of homework is not directly linked to students’ outcomes, I agree that it offers a myriad of other significant benefits. Ċ There are several reasons why homework is considered an unnecessary burden on children. First, there is evidence to support the idea that duty does nothing to improve educational outcomes. Countries such as Finland, where school children are not given assignments, regularly top international educational league tables and outperform nations where setting homework is the norm. Second, many parents would agree that the school day is already long-enough and leaves their children too tired and stressed to do a myriad of other duties when they return home. In fact, the study-and-life balance of offspring has been negatively affected due to overload assignments in many countries, resulting in hampering children’s brain development or a serious breakdown. Ċ In spite of the above arguments, giving assignments has an important part to play in the schooling of children. The main benefit of homework is that it encourages independent learning and problem-solving. In fact, offspring are challenged to work through tasks alone and at their own pace, which enables them to apply the knowledge that they have learnt in the classroom. In addition, developing an independent study habit is an essential and useful skill to prepare students to work alone as adults. For example, by doing mathematics exercises at home, students consolidate their understanding of the concepts taught by their teachers at school. Ċ In conclusion, homework certainly has its drawbacks. Nevertheless, the benefits that it produces outweigh them in the long term."
9303,human relationships can be affected by technology proliferation The technology development has affected social relationships from person to person. Do the positive aspects of this trend outweigh the negative aspects?,"Nowadays, the impacts of technology advancement on social connections have aroused public attention. Although the development of technology is not without detrimental effects, the upside would justify these. Ċ An array of drawbacks can be taken into account the fact that technology can harm real life connections. To some extent, as tremendous advances in technology could trigger the lack of social interactions, it would be detrimental to relationships in real life. In fact, people nowadays, especially young generations, tend to devote a great deal of time to glue their eyes on computer's screens or smartphones without having a face-to-face conversation, which potentially fractures their concrete relationships they have built up. Furthermore, the distraction caused by digital interactions could be blamed for deterioration in social relationships. Plenty of evidence suggests that frequent interruptions, namely checking phones or texting messages in the middle of a conversation, could result in conflicts, contributing to relationship degradation. Ċ Nevertheless, the potential pitfalls of this trend can be overshadowed by some considerable advantages. One possible upside is that the proliferation of technology has made the communication among people more accessible, users with electronic devices can therefore keep in touch with people at ease. In fact, they can have a conversation with others through a smartphone or a laptop, which can promote their social behavior and help them strengthen their social relationships. Another merit could be that people can seize the chances to expand their social circles by actively joining in social networks. This means that it is now possible for them to make friends around the globe regardless of geographical barriers, making them get socialized without inconveniences. Ċ To sum up, it is widely acknowledged that human relationships can be affected by technology proliferation. While advances in technology do come with some adverse effects on social relationships, the plus points far eclipse the drawbacks."
9304,"The planets population is reaching unsustainable levels and people are facing shortage of resources like water, food and fuel. To what consequences may over population lead? In your opinion what measures can be taken to fight over population?","It is irrefutable that the global population has grown drastically since the last few decades. This increase in the population leads to overutilisation of resources due to which they are depleting continuously. In this essay, I will discuss the consequences of overpopulation and suggest some measures to combat this situation. Ċ Overpopulation poses a major threat to our environment. The reason is that for feeding such a huge number of people, forest areas are being cleared up for agricultural land, leading to a huge impact on the wildlife inhabiting in that area. For instance, a number of bird species are on a verge of extinction or being extinct due to loss of habitat. Another repercussion is overburdening of medical systems as it would be complicated to proper health facilities to such an immense public. For example, overpopulation is the reason behind shortage of hospital beds in India, as a result of which many poor people die due to lack of proper medical care. Ċ There are numerous measures which could be taken by governments to tackle this issue. First of all, sex education should be provided to all the citizens. In other words, awareness campaigns should be initiated, so that the illiterate and ignorant folks would be aware regarding birth control methods, reproductive health and benefits of smaller families. Secondly, the authorities should urge the public to have one child, for instance, in 1980, one child policy was implemented by China to address its high rate of population. Ċ In conclusion, although the problem of overpopulation is insurmountable, it is the responsibility of government to take steps to tackle it."
9305,The government should not waste money on arts as this money would be better spent on other projects like sanitation or infrastructure. Do you agree with the above statement?,"In some countries, the government must not spend more funds for artistic interests as that amount can be helpful for people when spent on the development of building, roads and improving cleanliness. I totally agree with this because it is unnecessary for common people and improving useful elements would be appreciated by them. Ċ Middle-class people, the majority of the population in developing countries, expect mandatory support from authorities which will help in the betterment of their day-to-day activities. Most of the population in such countries have the least requirement of art and its related pleasures and are least appreciated. For example, a tall single standing statue of Mr Vallabhai Patel is built in India last year under the rule of Mr Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, for which he was criticized to a large extent by commoners and media, as India is in a great need of better education, medical support and infrastructure. Therefore, providing unnecessary amenities is not appreciated by the citizens. Ċ On the other hand, there are many countries in which basic needs are insufficient for the population exists. Construction of roads, hospitals, flyovers and improving the cleanliness of the surroundings will provide a comfortable life for everyone. For instance, in India, most of the government money is spent on developing rural areas with minimum needs and thousands of people are utilizing them efficiently which is highly appreciated by locals as it is providing them with a better quality of life. Hence, it is very important to spend money properly considering the needs of the people. Ċ To conclude, consuming the government's finances on arts is not appreciated by people who are in need of more necessary improvisations in development and sanitation of their country rather than arts and culture."
9306,"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement? Ċ You should write at least 250 words.","It is believed communities are regulated by regulations and legislation. Therefore, if individuals were independent to do anything desired, it could be a complete mess. Personally, I strongly agree with the view owing to the fact that orders punish the defendants. Although in some cases are exaggerated. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide evidence to prove the arguments. Ċ On the one hand, laws provide moral education for disobeying. In other words, they rehabilitate outlaws providing them with a sense of responsibility, and awareness of good and bad behaviour. Big cities could not be habitable, if the local regulations vanished, it is pointed out by recent research conducted by the University of Oxford for instance As a result, the number of bandits could exponentially soar as well as the death toll. Furthermore, it is seen as the prime reason for escalated conflict in many Brasilian shantytowns. Ċ On the other hand, heavy penalties are applied in some communities. Because of the increase in social issues like robbery and murder, local ruling uses stricter penalties, which are seen by critics as exaggerated. Let us as taking Georgia state as an example, a convicted is given approximately5 years of imprisonment for a simple robbery. Hence, jails are overcrowded remaining insufficient space in the detention centres. Moreover, it is the overriding motive for increased yearly unrest locally. Ċ To conclude, notwithstanding some drawbacks resulting in legislation and rules, they are a must in societies because provide a peaceful and tranquil environment to the local living. For this reason, I strongly agree with the view. I would go as far as to say, ruling power should adjust it for the benefits and safety of all."
9307,Do you agree or disagree that the best way to improve the quality of education is to increase teachers' salaries?,"I agree that the best way to improve the quality of education is to increase teachers' salaries. Ċ By increasing teachers' salaries, teachers can spend more time on education. When the government increases the teachers' salaries, teacher can produce more responsibility in education. If the government decreases the part of salary, teachers may have thought why do we spend a lot of time on this? The government may want to spend money on the equipment or computers. It also the ways of improvement the education. However, we do more, we should take more. This thought is everyone who must have. When the government want to change the education, teachers are the crucial point Ċ By increasing teachers' salaries, teachers can produce more enthusiasm in education. Teachers take the same salaries until today, when they entered this education. They must want to do more things at first. But things are changed, it need time to wait. However, government can increase their salaries in time, they have more confidence to insist. Ċ By increasing teacher's salaries, teachers can spend more time on focus teaching material of research. Teachers also want change the quality of education, which they can do starting form the teaching material. Today the government doesn't want to raise salaries of teachers who don't have other strength to improve the materials. In contrast, by increasing teacher's salaries, teachers can throw themself into research the materials. Ċ For the above reasons, I agree that the best way to improve the quality of education is to increase teachers' salaries. The reasonable salaries can improve the quality of education fast. Teachers are also people , is not machine. They also need money to relax so that they have strength when they back to work."
9308,"Question: Some people believe in the traditional idea that the woman's place is in the home, while others say that idea is outdated and that women should play an increasingly important role in the workplace of the future. What is your opinion?","There has been a long standing debate over the importance of woman's role at workplace or home. In my opinion female should not be restricted as a housewife and play an equally important role in workplace. Ċ Orthodox people believe that ladies in the family should better take care of family members, bring up children and maintain household works. This belief is majorly due to the assumption that men are the bread earner of the family. With this, it has been taken for granted that females have not responsibility to earn to support family. On contrast, the broad minded people believe that in modern society, current lifestyle and higher inflation have made it difficult to lead a comfortable life with one source of earning. As another source of income, employment of female partner is vital. Ċ In my opinion, financial independence of female in today's society is very important due to multiple reasons. Firstly, in advanced lifestyle, where divorce rate is surprisingly increasing, couples prefer to live independently. In this scenario, it not only becomes a necessity but mandatory for a single woman to work for her own livelihood. Apart from this, multiple industries in modern world mandate female workforce for certain types of jobs in the field of service, hospitality and nursing. Until women step out of their routine household work and equipped herself with proper education and employment, it would not be possible to build such a workforce. Ċ To conclude, in my personal opinion the men and women have equal ability and opportunities. Modern women should utilize their capabilities and work ability not only to achieve independence but also to contribute in development and advancement of the society."
9309,Some people argue that advertising is discouraging people from being different individuals and makes people to be or seem to be the same. Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays advertising has also become a business. Some people claim that advertisement motivates people to imitate others rather than being unique according to their interest. I disagree with this view as people likes to be different according to their interest. Ċ One of the reason for my view is lots of competition in todays market and people choose the best suitable for them. Every now and then new company and new brads are coming up with different materials in different styles and advertise with celebrities. For example there are various brands of clothes advertised by various celebrities. But everyone does not buy the same brand. They buy according to their interest and attitude on each brand and their advertisement. Hence there is no single brand that attracts majority of the population which will be imitated by the majority. Another reason is the practical life aspect, that is individual buy things based on their economic condition, interest, culture and tradition rather than just advertisement. For instance a dress material and colour may suit the model in an advertisement, but it may not suit all the people. So people are not only influenced by the advertisement but also various other factors. Ċ However some people argue that advertisement discourage individual to be unique. As there is a huge competition in the market all does not rely on one item, just because of the advertisement. Apart from this no individual can completely imitate another individual all the time. Hence advertisement does not completely influence a person. Ċ To conclude in my opinion as there is lot of competition in the global market People buy various things according to their interest, economic condition, likes, tradition and so on. Hence advertisement does not make people to be or seem to be the same as their advertisement."
9310,Topic: There is an idea that young people should not learn what the world is doing but what they can do to the world. To what extent do you agree with this statement? Uninterested Youth?,"Having considerable insight as to how the society function recently promotes the youth's self-development. This essay disagrees that young people put what condition the world is in aside and keep focusing on nothing but their capability. Updating with the world provides better opportunities to understand their inner self as well as puts them at ease to fulfil their potential. Ċ Gaining knowledge about their surrounding helps the young to find real person of who they are. Lacking of orientation towards world's trend, youngsters easily get frustrated and be bitterly disappointed with themselves as for example they could not find jobs. Gradually, they waste their inherent ability and are not able to realise their potentiality. They would get lost in the real world wondering who they are and what they are really doing. Thus bypassing the process of learning about the global issues prevents one from proving himself and his limit. Ċ Young people who grasp the world situation thoroughly could overcome setbacks and enhance the possibility for achievements. Spending time exploring the world means extending ""our knowledge of our ignorance"" (Karl Popper). For instance, Edison could invent the light bulb for the mankind because he could live in the world without it. He learned the difficulties the society was facing and took advantage of it to create a personal and social accomplishment. Therefore, the movements of every aspect of the world should be regarded as major priorities in education. Ċ In conclusion, this essay supports the idea that the young ought to consider the world's business in order to respect themselves and achieve success. It is recommended that schools encourage students to learn as a subject."
9311,"No1. Computers are more accessible and cheaper, as the result, more adults work at home and students study at home. Is this a positive or negative development?","Nowadays, with the advances in technologies, computer is less costly and more reachable than ever before. As a consequence, work efficiency has been improved significantly and students are allowed widely to study away from school. However, I would argue this is not a sustainable practice for a variety of reasons given in this essay. Ċ On the one hand, constantly staying at home for work or study might give rise to an acute stress. As a matter of fact, some adults or some students, who work or study away from company or school can highly meet with heavy burden as they have to carry the responsibility for the whole task they are in charge of. Students can rarely consult their tutors and exchange ideas with their classmates. As a result, a majority of them find it substaintially hard to meet the deadlines of tasks or assignments and finally fail to withstand the pressure and become deeply depressed. Ċ On the other hand, working and studying as a team can promote and facilitate soft skills. People might have more chance to talk and exchange ideas with each other. They can debate over and together develop the best potential plans. Likewise, in a group of students, the good ones can help the bad ones to solve the difficult assignments. Some intelligent students might even compete with each other to get the first place in school which consequently create the enthusiasm for their deeply studying and understanding of the subjects. It is apparent that people and students could hardly acquire these skills if they kept themselves away from offices and schools. Ċ In conclusion, to work or study at home has become a prevailing trend recently thanks to computers technologies advancement. However, it would better if adults and students could work and study with colleages and classmates."
9312,"In the past, people used to travel abroad to look many differences from their home country. Nowadays, the sceneries in places all over the world are more and more similar. What are the causes of the similarities? Do you think the advantages of this similarity outweigh the disadvantages?","It is undeniable that people are quite passionate to experience the different nations around the globe. Therefore, previously folks travelled to the different countries in order to see the different things rather than their own place, but these days everything looks the same in the whole world. This essay will discuss the reasons behind thisChange the determinertheseThe determiner this may be incorrect in this context. Consider changing it. Ċ show examples similarities and to my perspective, this trend possesses some drawbacks which are outweighed to its positive aspects. Ċ To begin with, there are several factors which bring similar things in all the countries . Firstly, the advancement in modern technology makes it possible to share the ideas all over, as the globe has become a global village, even the world of internet is so gigantic due to which individuals can exchange their viewpoints with each other and all this happened due to the modernization. Secondly, one nation could easily follow the sculptures, sight-seeing and, public buildings, so this is the main reason, why countries have a similar scenic view. For instance, in Auckland city of Newzealand and Toronto city of Canada has a similarly constructed building which is named as CN Tower in Toronto and Sky Tower in Auckland, the only difference in their names. Overall, globalization has made it possible to construct the same monuments. Ċ Moreover, the main disadvantages of the similarity are the lack of people's interest and economic growth. If there will be the same construction of renowned places all around the nations , then people will certainly lose their interest to visit these places and ultimately the economic growth will be affected immensely. Because these days tourists is a booming industry which boosts the economy of the territory, so the idea of similarity will leads towards the negative implications. For instances, there have been some recorded instances of people who only choose unique places to travel instead of similar ones. Thus, the demerits are higher which could not be ignored. Ċ To conclude, it is true that there are no big differences among the nations around the world in terms of scenic beauty these days. This essay discussed the pivotal reasons for the change and also its enormous disadvantages."
9313,Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better?,"Knowledge is for peoples own benefit. Universities nowadays demand students to take many subjects while some specialize in one. Both this aspect has its own viewpoint. I believe, taking many subjects is better than being expert in one. Ċ Firstly, specializing in one thing brings professionalism and practical use of knowledge to people. A doctor for example, being a physician is a very broad profession and yet there are many criteria that an individual may choose for them to become expert in one field. When a student doctor decided to be skillful in his chosen field, he/she must focus and expose himself to gain more information and be master on the particular area. However, information becomes beneficial when a person is able to use it. Ċ In contrary, a students who knows many subjects have a lot of advantage in job hunting rather than students knows only one. Since most of the students have no practical experience, having broad knowledge can win more attention to employers. In our modern society, most of the job offer require employee who occupy a lot of knowledge. For instance, I as a nurse is a very huge profession because you must know a lot. As part of our curriculum I need to study some of subjects like chemistry, pharmacology and even nutrition and diet. I don't need to be expert in this subjects, but I must have an idea about it. For having knowledge to this different curriculum I have more chances to apply in laboratories, drugstores and in restaurant even if it is not my field of duty. Ċ In conclusion, a student who has a pack of knowledge, has a greater advantage for his/her own future. Presumably employers would choose someone who has more skills and talents. Being flexible is somewhat a profit to any individual."
9314,Some people consider price as most important thing to think about when buying product (such as cell phone) or service (medical treatment). Do you agree or disagree?,"Most of the costumers nowaday's look for the price first before thinking if they will buy the product. Most stores sell products at a cheaper price even it is not good. I agree with this notion for two reasons, the person wanted the quality of the product and reliability. Ċ To begin with, many cheap things are rampant in the market today, some people who can't afford to buy expensive products tend to settle with the low quality. Cell phones, for instance, good quality phones are iPhone in this new era, but on the other hand, it was so expensive. It is not easy to broken, the quality of the camera was so good and it has a lot of features. So many individuals want to have this kind of phone though it will cost them a lot of money. Ċ Secondly, most of the sellers offer cheap services like medical treatment, and people who do not have enough money are forced to try this kind of scam. For example, in the country that belongs to the third world or has a low budget in terms of health, people tend to be content in this kind of service, however, there are a lot who are willing to pay much just to get good treatment, and they know that it can be reliable, it was proven and tested. Therefore, they are not hesitant to spend more because they can get good quality and reliable service. Ċ To sum up, price matters in the products especially in cell phones or services like medical treatment, hence, people wanted to spend more to have good quality than having a cheap one and not having good features and services."
9315,"Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. Others , however , believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Although sometimes is thought that drivers should be strictly punished for driving infractions, other people believe that there are other ways to decrease car accidents. In my opinion, I consider that high fines avoid drivers to commit the same infraction several times for the same reason. Ċ On the one hand, people think that the high fines and other strict punishments bring about the rising consciousness among drivers which I agree. In other words, when a driver is imposed to pay for his infraction this somehow lead him to learn about that infraction, therefore, he will not make the same mistake in a second opportunity. Secondly, when people fork out paying fines all the money paid can be used for the State to elevate the number of safety and surveillance within the streets, as a consequence, reducing the number of car accidents. Ċ On the other hand, it is often believed that education is the best way to protect the community from car crashed numbers. This means that giving drivers all the information needed is rather than just make them pay for their mistakes. To illustrate, some countries had adopted a punctuation system when they watched the numbers of a car crashed rise. This system consists of making drivers to attending a school driving since they reach a certain number of points for each infraction, thus, they go back to school to refresh all the knowledge acquired years ago when they got the first license. It is also believed that a simple notification is enough. Sometimes drivers just do not know, for example, the speed limit of a road or street owing to the lack of information in the area, however, they end-up committing the infraction, as a consequence, they can not be fined since the fault is not them. Ċ In conclusion, both sides have their merits but I believe that the only way to guarantee community safety is by imposing strict fines."
9316,Question: Do you agree or disagree with the follow statement ? Game are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and example to support your answer.,"As is commonly understood. Games is one of activity which makes happy everybody. There is statement about game are as important for adult as they are for children so i do strongly support the idea that, it has benefits for adults such as getting money, refresh mind, and getting friend. I give my reassons to support my answer. Ċ One reasson for supporting game is getting money, Each society like game. Usually, they are games together with friend and his brother. Actually , I like playing game because it can make refresh mind. I have many friends for playing game. For example, formerly, I played game together with my friend in ""Warnet"" . so, we made group to compete when we got good point in game. We will get much money form playing game. This example clearly shows , not only I and my friend play game, but also there are many adults join in there. After that , I have new friend and we con get refresh mind.

If they are adults who want to look for job for continues their life and it is better than playing game. But there are people who like playing game until adults so it makes them happy. Ċ To sum up, Game one of activity has many benefits for everybody because we can get money,refresh mind, getting new friend. So, I completely agree with that statement with my reasons this."
9317,"Some people believe that elderly employees are more useful to a company, while others believe that young employees are better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Although many individuals claim that senior labour force is beneficial for the sake of a corporation, others think that young workers are far better. In this essay, I agree that hiring old people have a competitive advantage over hiring a young worker. This essay will discuss both points of views. Ċ On the one hand, many people consider that elderly employees are able to make a bigger impact on their companies positively. Moreover, older employees have a great amount of experience related to their area of specialization. It is therefore agreed, being an expert for a position to make good decisions take more than a decade of background. For example, a recent Cambridge study showed that 75% of companies prefer to employ older people who are usually capable to cope with problems thanks to their maturity. Therefore, it is obviously the case that generally young professionals are unable to reach the desired level in their young ages, unlike aged ones. Ċ On the other hand, it is believed by some that young professionals are better. This is because not only they are of great energy to realise required tasks, but also, they are usually open to learning new skills to soar their knowledge. Despite this, many responsibilities require a high level of experience which solely can be obtained from years of working in a particular area. For instance, a study by Oxford found that an area of specialization in a certain business requires more than a decade of working background. Thus, it is certainly the case that generally elder people have a great contribution to a company. Ċ In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinion, I think that businesses can hire an aged workforce in order to utilize their experience to increase their profit. However, companies will start to bring older workers and young professionals to share their skills to increase efficiency."
9318,It is sometimes said that a high salary is the most important factor in choosing a job. Do you agree?,"Nowadays, individuals are involved in their jobs more than their families. Some people regard the figure for income associated with the job as the most decisive factor in trending towards that. In my opinion, there are other factors in choosing a suitable career that should be considered. Ċ It is true that people work for the wage but it is my view that the one’s satisfaction with their job depends on many other factors such as a friendly space and getting along with colleagues. For instance, if you have a mean boss at your office, you will face emotional and psychological problems in the long run. In addition, research findings confirm that interest plays a vital role in choosing a career. I know numerous individuals who are at the highest level of success in their job, whereas they are not happy with their life. Ċ In contrast, there are some individuals that claim financial issues should be considered foremost when people are exploring what they want to do for the living costs. They insist, As a result of an insufficient salary, people would be compelled to work more than eight hours a day. However, I do not find this argument convincing as I think if people carry out what they are interested in, they would enjoy spending more time on their job. For example, I can remember my uncle who was a painter and sometimes his painting took more than fifteen hours a day, while he did not care about that. Ċ In conclusion, I completely disagree with regarding high salary as the most important factor in finding a job because I believe, people should follow their dreams an interest that cause be successful and earn an adequate income."
9319,Topic: It is generally believed that education is of vital importance to individual development and the well-being of societies. What should education consist of to fulfill both these functions?,"Unarguably, primitive times witness the great influences of education in human's lives. That what people should be taught to not only make themselves develop but also the whole society is still a debate. In this essay, there will be solutions to this issue. Ċ First of all, to improve individuals' development, children should be taught to be competitive. For instance, there will be schools for gifted, those who have ability will be entitled to study there. Students will push themselves to their limit to fight with each other to get into these schools. Therefore, it is their own abilities will grow up. However, talented people will be unevenly spread in our society. Dangerously, people will have a tendency to become selfish, they will not pay attention to anyone but themselves, which can reduce human interaction. Ċ On the other hand, education can include cooperation. For example, schools will organize teamwork experiments. Students have to work with each other to do these. Therefore, students can join individual strength, which can aid their performance. Moreover, they will be able to react to conflicts occurring and blend in social network quickly. Besides, they will depend on others and don't know how to make it on their own. Ċ In a nutshell, it is certainly the case that we should mingle teamwork and competitive attitudes together to get a fulfillment of individual development and our country prosperity."
9320,"Psychological illnesses may not be as obvious as physical disabilities or illnesses, nevertheless they are just as disabling in their own way. Society, however, is more accepting of those with physical than psychological illnesses or disabilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The quantity of diseases connected with the humans’ bad mental condition has been increasing during the last years. The medical workers and the greatest part of people disregard such diseases, considering that they are not so dangerous and problematic as physical diseases. Although I agree, that often physical problems may lead to more limit abilities of individuals, the psychological problems should be discussed by medical society too, due to its importance. Ċ On the one hand, due to the similarity of stress symptoms to physical deviations, they are considered as no dangerous diseases, which do not lead to heavy consequences. Almost all mental problems can develop during a long period and do not have any serious symptoms. That is why the doctors often give to the patient some pills and do not assign an examination, hoping that the tablets will help. For example, according to statistics of the neurological clinic, nearly 70% of hospital visitors told that after a definite course of sedative treatment their pains passed. Thus, in some cases, physical problems are considered such slight and safe diseases, because they can disappear independently or with the help of pills. Ċ On the other hand, humans with an invalid mind may provoke several social problems and peril in society. During the last 10 years the number of crimes, related to physical unhealthy people, such as maniacs or unbalanced individuals, increased considerably. Moreover, even small derivations in physical health may cause several neurodegenerative diseases. If a person notices a loose of memory, aggressive behaviour and irritability, it is the first call for attendance a doctor. For instance, one of the latest articles in the respectable journal called Nature Science provided information that the Alzheimer disease resulted from the bad function of neuron cells and at the initial stage the symptoms are similar to the simple distraction and anxiety. Thus, physical derivations are the bells, which urge a person to visit the doctor or watch for dynamic of their well-being more carefully. Ċ To sum up I think that physical problems are important due to their danger and sometimes stealth. Every person should keep track of health and asks for medical help because the only careful attitude of well-being will allow preventing negative consequences, such as various diseases and social conflicts."
9321,Some people believe that one-on-one lessons are better for learning while others think that group lessons are superior. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Some individuals prefer learning English in a group because they think, that this learning process can help to achieve better results. Meanwhile, other individuals prefer one-on-one lessons for the same reasons. This essay will discuss both views on this opinion. In my perspective, one-on-one lessons better encourage an educational process, because they provide a closer bond between teacher and student. Ċ During individual lessons, teachers and students have an opportunity to communicate more frequently, which, doubtless, positive influence on academic achievements. If some aspects of the subject were unclear for students, they could always clarify it immediately. Moreover, teachers can observe students' academic progress without any interference, therefore, it helps to plan lessons according to their needs. For instance, foreign language is frequently learned in individual lessons. This is explained by the fact, that learning foreign languages considers one of the most difficult spheres of education. This learning experience clearly evidences that this method can bring better results. Ċ Meanwhile, some people, in general, tend to believe, that group lessons can provide better education. One of the main reasons, which encourages this opinion, is that communication between participants may help to understand a learning material more deeply. Nonetheless, all students cannot learn at the same speed. For example, some persons may understand the materials significantly faster than others. However, they cannot increase their progress further and have to wait for other students, before the whole class may shift to the next theme. Consequently, individuals with good academic results may lose an opportunity to study subjects more deeply. Ċ In conclusion, taking the above-mentioned information into consideration, it is undeniable, that group lessons cannot respond to all students' needs and students with excellent academic results can suffer. Meanwhile, one-on-one lessons are more adapted to that needs. Consequently, in my opinion, one-on-one lessons are preferable."
9322,Some people like to spend their leisure time with their colleagues while others prefer to keep their private life separate from their work life. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"People have contrasting views, whether they should spend their past time with co-workers or keep their personal life away from them. In my opinion, it is better to discrete personal and professional aspects; however, both views will be discussed in the essay. Ċ On the one hand, sharing personal aspects with office-mates promotes corporate rivalry. A workplace is a place of competition, where fellow workers can create conspiracies if anyone exclusively spends his free time with them, because, in relaxing periods, anyone can be emotional and unconscious to share information, which could have negative impacts on his career if the management is notified. It would not be a surprising thing if any co-worker shares these secrets with the authority to clear the path of promotion. For example, recently an executive of a bank lost his job for travelling outside of the city as it was restricted from the bank during the pandemic situation; the information was reported to the human resource department via his colleagues. Ċ Nevertheless, accompanying co-workers extensively enhance the bonding. While people significantly spend moments together, it usually creates an emotional attachment among them. Consequently, that approach could lead them to be respectful and helpful to each other, which might increase productivity. For instance, it has been seen that having an exclusive relation with colleagues servers the advantage of sharing workloads with them. Despite this, people should limit their time for office-mates, because they are required to socialize with their family, friends and relative also to balance their life. Moreover, service holders spend most of their weekdays with officials. Ċ In conclusion, although some people prioritize to pass their leisure with co-workers, I think it is secured to spend a few moments with them beyond the profession because work-mates could prove dangerous for career progression. Therefore, it is better for professionals to separate their personal and professional life."
9323,"Many things can influence the academic achievement and emotional growth of a student. In this regard, peers have more of an impact than teachers do. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","In recent years, whether academic success and emotional development are affected by teachers or classmates is a subject of discussion. Although a number of people are in favor of considering teachers to have a greater impact on students' performances, I firmly believe that peers are more influential than teachers. Ċ To begin with, it is clear that since motivated by competing with other classmates, a student can achieve academic success. To be more specific, pupils have a desire to outperform peers, as demonstrating broader knowledge and high score achievements. This affects the improvements of not only students' self-study skills but also their efforts in better performances. According to recent surveys, a number of undergraduates stated that they have more motivation to study in which challenging themselves to compete with other classmates plays a vital role rather than requirements from the teachers. These surveys offer strong evidence to prove that classmates place significant effects on students' academic achievement. Ċ On top of that, having relationships with other classmates helps expand students' social circle, which means placing impacts on their emotional development. Pupils spend most of their time with classmates at school in which they share new ideas, beliefs, and experiences with others. Developing good relationships with friends allows pupils to learn how to control and express their emotions as well as the right way of behavior. One study has shown that undergraduates perform better management of emotional expression by cooperating and interacting with peers. This illustrates that relationships with classmates are essential for juniors with regard to emotional development. Ċ Overall, classmates play an essential role in motivating undergraduates to enhance their knowledge and control their emotional expressions. For these reasons, it is obvious that peers have more effects on students' academic achievement and emotional growth."
9324,Some companies sponsor sports as a way to advertise themselves.Some people think it is good.While other think there are disadvantages.Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"During these days, enterprises are sponsoring their goods with the assistance of players. Although it is believed by certain individuals that this practice is beneficial, others argue that there are some downsides related to this trend. In my opinion, I consider that it promotes the value of a game and a player as it provides financial support.  Ċ On the one hand, some people assert that the promotion of agencies through sports tournaments can support the players financially which is profoundly imperative and I agree. In other words, athletes need revenue to purchase sports equipment or kits, travel expenses, uniforms and other additional expenditures which sometimes are not fully fulfilled by the authorities properly. For example, the under 18 cricket team requested bills in 2015 in India which was assisted by various brands and in ,return their sales were hiked as per reports. Therefore, funding assistance from private organizations is not only productive for them but also for the aspiring teams who want to represent themselves at the national or international level. Ċ On the other hand, others who say that this trend can have negative effects, give their reasons as follows. First of all, followers or fans can be misguided by the brands endorsed by their favourite players. In this context, as players are earning a huge amount of money, sometimes they do not do deep research about the product. As a result, people can waste their money due to inappropriate information delivered to the public from their role models. Ċ In conclusion, whilst many people vary in their opinions, I think that monetary support from the corporations is highly valuable as it requires a lot of funds to aid sports tournaments and in return, industries are getting benefit too which is a win-win situation."
9325,"In some countries, private cars are now banned from certain city centres. What are the advantages of such a system and do you feel that this is something that most cities should adopt?","Most individuals are likely to be more satisfied when they live with many facilities including a transportation system. Private cars are forbidden to use in some particular areas of certain cities,substituting with the public transport system. In my opinion,the benefits of this situation could be best modernised with a slight weakness in accordance with one's lifestyle in the cities. Ċ Most towns are facing the problem of living clusters. Private cars are then restricted use in the central,to reduce this congestion. With regard to the advantages of the measure, one of them is reducing traffic problems and air pollution in the metropolis zone. The fewer transports are used,the better people's quality of life is. Moreover,another strength is that more range to use for citizens is beneficial to their living such as more public field and more community zone. Ċ A limitation of using their own transports may alleviate certain problems, also facilitate those population living. Despite this, one of the weaknesses should be considered that the difficulty of commuting from some places to another is likely to be harder in comparison to using their own cars. Similarly, people,who live outside the city, also inconveniently travel to the central. Ċ In conclusion,limiting using private transports in specific zones is more likely to be advantageous with a little inconvenient commute. I think that the government could improve the situation by planning and constructing the public transportation system so that cover all of the living space where people live,which support sustainable growth in the long term."
9326,The death penalty is the best way to control and reduce serious crime. To what extent do you agree?,"Some people believe that capital punishment is no humane way for execution, even if that person has committed a grave offence. Others think that the extreme penalty is necessary to keep the security system efficient in society. Personally, I believe that capital punishment is a necessary evil for a grave offence. This essay will support my opinion with some reasons and examples. Ċ Firstly, in our world exist people who commit really evil which cannot be fixed and no place for forgiveness. People with a violent nature should be removed from the community as early as possible. For example, any maniacs kill not only one person, but they also have a lot of victims, and usually, it is old people, children or women. I believe that all law-abiding citizens want to live in peace and the secure world which is no place for terrorists, maniacs and child rapists. Ċ Secondly, the death penalty is more cost-effective punishment and a cheaper alternative to prison. In other words, if the prisoners were incarcerated for long periods in prison; the government should allocate more funds to policing the prisons and accommodating those convicts. This means that the taxpayers have to pay bills for long term accommodation for those criminals. In my opinion this money better to spend on the healthcare system, education, etc. Furthermore, it can bring more economic advantages to the country like a safer place to visit. Ċ In conclusion, the death penalty is a must for any country that wants to deter criminals, who commit outrageous crimes, and not one that wants to waste money on prisoners because of long sentences."
9327,"Some people believe that governments should fund and promote artistic and cultural activities for their citizens. Others, however, think that these activities should be left to private individuals and institutions.  Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","The government plays an important role in developing a country. That is why there is an argument as to how the government should invest more in either artistic or cultural activities. While other people believe that private individuals and institutions should take these activities, I am personally convinced that government should maintain these activities properly as a country's asset. Ċ Art is a product of human expression and for this case government should give the amount of finance to promote and cultural activities because these activities are countries symbol so as to prominent for them to preserve properly these activities. To exemplify, traditional dance such as ""Reog Ponorogo"" in Indonesia is the famous traditional activity in Indonesia. By this truly fact, all countries around the world recognize well that this country is original from Indonesia. Automatically, this is a significant symbol which is owned by Indonesia. Consequently, the development of culture and artistic is in government's hand. Ċ On the other hand, some artistic and cultural activities should be taken to private in individuals and institution because in this reality governments do not pay attention more through these activities. However, when these activities were handled by private institution, they will preserve them as perfect as possible because they tend to utilize them as their asset to obtain much profit. As a result, this artistic and cultural activity appears lovingly when it comes to private institution's hand. Ċ On the whole, both artistic and cultural activities were prominent aspects for the development of country. While private institution enables to maintain it perfectly, I strongly argue that private institution will handle these fully, and doubtfully, all citizens cannot own these activities as their countries' pride."
9328,"boarding schools for kids. Question: Some people feel that boarding schools are an excellent option for children, while other people disagree for a number of reasons. consider both sides of this debate and reach a conclusion.","Some believe that boarding schools are the best for children to study. However, this idea is not entirely straightforward. Some people argue the opposite side because of several reasons. This essay will discuss the debate and give a concluding view. Ċ On the one hand, those who support study in boarding schools believe some educational benefits children can have. This includes an extra focus on study and more participation in extracurricular activities. Another argument is children will develop some good characteristics while studying in boarding schools. For instance, care and responsibility. These qualities might be induced in children because they have to take care of their daily routine tasks on their own. Finally, it might be said that children will learn to be independent. As a result of this, they will learn a lot of life skills as they try to take care of their needs. Ċ On the other hand, opponents of this view, point out that children will have a lack of parent's care and love if they choose to study in boarding schools. Another reason is some children may feel homesickness sometimes as they are residing away from family. This may result in stress or some mental health problems for children. The outcome of this may affect their study or they can lead to bad habits. Ċ In summary, it appears that children can get a better study, develop some good qualities, and learn to be independent while studying in boarding school. However, it does not seems a prime idea as they lack family love and face so many problems because they live alone and far away from home."
9329,It has been noted that many people who had a big impact on the world gave themselves completely to their work and did not bother with the idea of “work-life balance”. To what extent should people try to have a good work-life balance?,"It has been seen by many people that successful and powerful men gain it almost completely out of work. Overall, accordingly of many researches, work without rest leads to a problem with health, thereby some people cannot finish for reason fatigue or mental disease. Ċ Firstly, a society cannot decline the fact what diminishes of leisure time give you more time on the work to finish cases. Therefore, some people who committed an idea completely forget about all, and a lot of time it leads to the exciting result. For example, the news not once says about a lot of powerful politicians who gain success because of sleep three or four hours per day. Likewise, some successful men told what they have the unique work-life balance that allows them to recover body without miss any minute from work. Ċ Although, at the same time people should in all effort care about good work-life balance because peoples' bodies have restricted quantity of sources which means eventually them unavoidable need rest. For instance, scientists noticed that people who restless has a problem with insomnia. As a result, people, especially with dilapidated health, should care about vacation; however, not detrimental to their work and responsibilities. Moreover, peoples' body with ages tends to faster tire and slowly recover, thereby if youth work to fatigue and can do it all week, so elderly people need more balanced work for qualitatively care about their responsibility. Ċ To conclude, people can sometimes forget about rest for a result; nevertheless, they should recover the source after. Furthermore, all people are different, consequently, they will need to individually consider their capabilities and make their balance for evading problem with health in the future because any results worthless if price wellness or life."
9330,Some people feel that global warming should be dealt with by governments. Others feel that it is responsibility of individuals in society to solve the problem. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"To reduce the increased temperature due to human's activities on earth must be halt with the contribution of the authorities. Although this notion is favoured by some part of the society, others have a counter-argument that to tackle the indicated serious issue people have to take some actions. I personally believe that both have their own importance to stop global warming. Initially, my essay will demonstrate the role of government and then argue that public responsibilities towards it. Ċ To begin with, the uses of fossil fuels by the industries at large scale and exhaust fumes produce from huge uses of private means of transportation by the people could be halted when there will be solid law employed by the authority against overuse of these resources. As a result, to avoid any high penalty human will reduce the usage . For instance, a survey conducted recently has revealed that 40% of pollution can be minimized globally if society follows the issued law and order with responsibility. Therefore, by applying legal terms changes in climate can be stopped for the long term. Ċ Nevertheless, since it is an individual's responsibility as well to maintain the earth's climate. The major contribution of humans is that they must travel in public transportation rather than their own vehicles. Thus, it will decrease the level of exhaust fumes which are harmful to our atmosphere. To illustrate, commuting by metro or buses not only helps to reduce the use of dangerous energy sources such as oil or gas but also solve the traffic congestion problem. Hence, the environmentally friendly demeanour assist to reduce the temperature of the earth's surface. Ċ To conclude, government's laws could bring major changes in society and following these laws as responsible citizens public could reduce global warming. Overall, in my opinion, authorities and communities have to work simultaneously to solve the major issue and get back to nature."
9331,"TASK 2 In recent times, many people are making the decision to live alone. What are the causes of this? Does it have positive or negatives effects on society?","Undoubtedly, enjoyable life span is the immense desire for every dweller, and those individuals have their own method to pursue it. For some, the best technique is to live alone without any relations. This decision can cause by their personality and their career. Moreover, it will bring positive impact like more savings and the demerit such as depression. Ċ There are, at least, two major reason why people choose to being alone until the rest of their life. First and foremost, it is their life perspective. When they have an introvert personality, they will tend to avoid a social interaction and prefer to live without life companion. Secondly, a career path will cause a lonelyness option to some folk as well. A labour who has a high mobility in job will be distrupted if they have an obligation to be along with their family. Ultimately, people will vote to be unmaried and thrilled their choice. Ċ Furthermore, both merit and drawback will be rendered by this choice. It will cause someone's saving increase. As such they only have to spend money for their own personal needed, not for children, more furnitures, and so on. Otherwise, the outrageous effect will obtain a deep depression. This is because, phychologically, individuals as a homo sapiens need other people to support each others. Ċ To sum up, personal character and job matter can be a predominant factors leading a decision to live alone. Beside it can jump dwellers' savings, these action can fall them into the depression valley. Where possible, I highly likely recommend to the inhabitants to make a balance life even they choose to be a single one."
9332,"In some countries, shopping online is replacing shopping at stores. Do you think it is a positive or negative development ? (approximately 250 words)","It is true that today more and more people do their purchases on the Internet instead of going to physical stores. I believe that such a trend can be both positive and negative. Ċ On the one hand, shopping online has several perks. Firstly, such a method of purchase usually offers convenience. Customers can easily buy items from the comfort of their homes or workplaces and it is also uncomplicated to cancel transactions if they regret the selected merchandise. As a result, people will prefer this prevalent mode of shopping as it helps them decide how they will spend their time on other life activities. Secondly, online stores can give consumers the ability to compare products and their prices. The selling companies show the full range of products they have available to attract customers with different tastes and needs as well as extremely competitive prices. This eventually allows buyers to choose from a variety of models after comparing the features and price of the products on display and decide what to buy. Some commercial platforms in Vietnam such as Tiki, Shopee, and Lazada are currently successful for their diversity of stores, products, and prices that can satisfy different classes of consumers. Ċ On the other hand, there are many drawbacks of doing shopping on the Internet despite the advantages mentioned above. Fraud is the biggest downside of this. Many websites often show some great products at attractive promotions that seem too good to be true to draw attention from people and then sell fake products instead of genuine items. Customers will either end up receiving the fake product or not receiving the product at all, and it could ruin their shopping experience. Another negative point can be a delay in delivery. Unlike traditional marketplaces where customers can merely try and receive the product at the same time, which does not happen in online purchases that normally they must wait from a few hours to several working days or months depending on the distance and shipping policy. In an emergency, if people need a certain good immediately, the best option is still physical stores. Ċ In conclusion, although shopping online can bring many benefits for people in modern life, offline stores are still an adequate place for them to browse useful merchandise and experience the shopping atmosphere."
9333,Some people think that renewable energy sources like solar and wind power should replace fossil fuels such as coal and gas as soon as possible. Others think we should continue to use fossil fuels while it is still cheap to do so. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"The debate weather renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are better for the environment, as opposed to the sources like fossil fuel and gas, has become a matter of discussion for many. In my opinion, for our planet, it would be more beneficial to start using renewable energy sources. In this essay, I shall examine the both points of view and present supporting argument for my selection. Ċ To start with, there are numerous predominant factors, which suggest that the use of renewable energy sources is a better option. Firstly, the issue of environmental pollution resulting from burning coal and fossil fuel, has now become a global threat. The only possible solution to this problem is to either reduce or completely eliminate the use of the non-renewable energy sources and shift all the attention to the other alternatives. Secondly, a recently published study at the Stanford University, showed that in next 5 years, our world is expected to run out of fossil fuel. This is an alarming issue, which requires immediate actions. If we failed to make the switch to more environmentally friendly sources, this could result in serious consequences. Ċ On the other hand, there are some undeniable advantages of the non-renewable energy sources. For example, due to the easy availability, the prices of these types of sources are very less. In addition, many studies have shown that 95% of the vehicles in the world are running on gas or oil, and currently only a fraction of the vehicles are using electricity as their fuel source. A shift to using only electric vehicles could cause a collapse in the market. Ċ In conclusion, this is a topic which raises many questions in contemporary life. From the given examples, It is clear that both sides have strong supporting arguments. Nevertheless, I am still inclined to say that renewable power sources are the key to a better future."
9334,"Ielts Task2, old man live with young or not Should old man live with young people together, or should they live in the clubs for old men? Please discuss.","Nowadays, thanks to the dramatic development of medicine industry and the improvement of quality of life, the life expectation is improved steadily. It, as a result, more and more seniors in the society and it has raised a obvious question, does the elders should live with their descendant or they are going to social house for older people. In my opinion, it is better that the whole family live together and are given as following Ċ Firstly, the foreseen benefits of living together are that the senior can teach and give their experience to their children or grandchildren. This is a valuable gift for us, with this experience, we can save lots of time to develop a new thing. In general, the society can spend less money, time for education, development so on and so forth. Ċ Secondly, when we are living together, it is obvious that we have a chance to take care of each other especially our seniors. In Asian custom, it is really important to take care of your parents in order to show your respect, grateful for their feeding and it is also the lesson for your child to mimic as well. Ċ Although I also agree that if the elder live in the house which is dedicated for them, they may be more fun as they will meet all people more or less the same as them. It, however, they also may be sad if they witness their friend pass away and without hearing the smiley face from the children. Ċ In a nutshell, I think that it is better for elder to live with their offspring rather live in the elder club."
9335,"When international media (including movies, fashion shows, advertisements and other TV programmes) convey the same messages to the global audience, people argue that the expansion of international media has negative impacts on cultural diversity. What is your opinion?","Owing to the distribution of social media, several representatives of modern society deem that such diversity of TV broadcasts exert a negative influence on communities. From my perspective, it can not be denied that this position is composed of a fraction of the truth. Therefore, I am going to reflect on this essay my own view of such an issue and to provide strong arguments, which confirm my core opinion. Ċ On the one hand, we can observe that the capabilities of the Internet have undergone overwhelming changes. Indeed, international news provides a plethora of information for communities. Thus, people can plunge into events, which happens across the world. Moreover, TV broadcasts give an opportunity to increase knowledge of various customs and cultures. Hence, I suggest that such an influence by means of social media have a beneficial effect, rather than an adverse effect. Ċ On the other hand, several experts allege that contemporary technology exerts a negative impact on the population. One of the main reasons why they contend such consists of globalisation. At first, the globalisation process triggers certain repercussions for the world such as the growth of the unemployment level. Secondly, this process influences cultures. For instance, a lot of newscasts, films, bands, which are originated from one country, can destroy a representation of others. In my opinion, such destruction is the main flaw of international social publishing. Consequently, humans should not forget about the existence of various cultures. As I have mentioned, international programs afford to learn about countries, however, a style of the dominant culture should not be promoted. Ċ To sum up, I would stress that having made these points, it is true that such a tendency incurs criticism. Nonetheless, only persons must decide upon for themselves which social media they prefer. From my point of view, if the watching process of TV broadcasts are used for the right purposes, their benefits outweigh their drawbacks."
9336,"Topic: In modern society, fashion is becoming more highly valued in people's choice of clothes. Why? Do you think it is a positive or negative development? fashion boom in the developing world","Many years ago, our ancestor that underwent the situation of stablising the world that occured countless war to invade or self - defend. In this situation, hardly we could conceive that fashion would be more precise in the future. In my view, it is a great expression to reflect the society progressing. Ċ First, while the basic human needs were met like food, water, they would begin to consider the less basic and fundamental needs like clothings. This means that we could realise the great progress without incredibly regarding what people would digest in the next days. It is a signal that make society more progressive and have access to the more valuable things. Ċ I believe that it is a positive development to live in a society that everyone have their self - expression to reflect their own characters, taste, likes. For example, without saying any word, we could still catch surrounding people's attention by individual clothing styles which in turn creat the great sympathy from people around. While your appearance is actually polite, this also express your respect to the others. Ċ To conclude, the value of how fashionable they wear is increasingly more important to human race that is a signal of the pace of development. The popularity of thinking would let people seek themselves through what they want to put on their body."
9337,Many parents give jobs to their children to do around the house in order to develop their characters and self-sufficiency. Ċ Discuss this idea and give your opinion. Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.,"In the modern-day, many guardians provide jobs for their children to do around the house in order to develop their own characters and self-sufficiency. From my point of view, its work that they offer can cause both positive and negative effects to their own children. In the following paragraphs, both of these viewpoints will be discussed in detail before the conclusion is reached. Ċ 	To commence, a lot of parents know exactly what chores can help their children. In other words, they have been together since their child was born as a baby. Thus, they understand clearly which chores can improve their skills of the children. It follows that all children develop their level of characters and self-sufficiency easier than let them find and do by their own methods. Besides, it can be helpful in many aspects such as they can manage their life better than before or keep themselves calm because the chores need to use the intention of their own thoughts before the things is done. Ċ 	However, some people might argue that provide too much jobs can cause a bad effect for teenagers. For example, if their guardians give the housework to their children while the professors of their own children make a schedule for the test, the children are going to lose their time uselessly. In simple terms, they will not have much time to keep themselves prepared for the exam. Moreover, if there is too much housework, it can be harmful because their children can be stressed by the tension from their parents. Afterwards, their children will not develop their own skills. Ċ 	In conclusion, it can be seen that despite these two opinions on the topic, it still be very personal questions for their parents. Both of these viewpoints have benefits and drawbacks that have to be considered by their own guardians."
9338,"in most successful organizations, some people believe that communication between managers and workers are the most important factor, other people say that other factors are more important. discuss both views and give your opinion.","There are two arguments among the society that some people believe verbal interaction between managers and staff is the most essential factor to build a successful companion. However, other communities think that there are more other factors that make an organization succeed. Even though those arguments are reliable and logical, in this essay, I will discuss two opinions by objective reasons. Ċ First of all, communication is the main key to gaining performance among colleges. In addition, most companies even have a special consultation for build-up a good communication among employees and they have a Human Resources Development (HRD) to manage all staff. Verbal interaction between workers and their principal leads to better results. For example, it can tighten relations among workers and managers, build sympathy for others, and avoid misunderstanding that can cause many crucial problems in the office. Ċ Moreover, having tight communication is not enough. Some people believe that the company must treat all workforce fairly and are given other prosperity to their employees to make companies succeed. These profits include material or immaterial matters. Material benefits such as, given an appropriate salary, and insurance, and a salary pension. On the other hand, immaterial profits, for instance, get a promotion for the exemplary staff, have paid leave for all staff, provide vacation days and scholarships. Ċ In conclusion, my take on this, to build a good interaction between their principal and workers is necessary. However, the staff must be provided material and immaterial welfare to increase their performance in the office and make a company more successful."
9339,Money spent on phones. Topic: Some people today spend too much money on their phone. What do you think? You should write about 250 words.,"Phones play an essential role in society these days, thanks to their advantages. Therefore, several individuals spend a tremendous amount of money buying or upgrading their phone. While some people believe doing that is an action of wasting money and disagree with it, I would argue that people have the rights to do anything they want to as long as it suits their circumstances. Ċ When phones appeared many years ago, they served firstly as devices which facilitate communication, especially for two persons being far from each other. Then, phones have been gradually advanced in their appearances and their uses due to the development of technologies. Hence, phone now is not only a way of keeping in touch but also a powerful tool called smartphone which brings more convenience to human lives. Besides, phones are also used for fashion reasons. Many phone models are designed quite beautifully and fashionably to enhance the appearance of various people. On the other hand, owning a limited or luxury phone is an excellent way to show the levels or the reputations of the rich men. Ċ Because of their technologic, economic and fashionable features, phones cost not cheap, even extremely expensive for some sorts of famous brands. For instance, a new smartphone of Apple can be valued equally to a motorbike or a modern laptop. However, people completely feel free to do that if those phones adapt their demands without disturbing their lives in term of finance. Ċ In conclusion, spending much money on phones is right if it is suitable to the individual's situation, and I believe that everyone has responsibility for their decision which others cannot judge or criticize."
9340,Some people believe that mobile phone conversations should be banned in crowded and social places. Others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"These days, due to the fast development of communication technology, societies can speak on the cell phone easily that can be done anywhere. Some people argue the conversations are supposed to be prohibited as they may bother others and for a certain culture, the practices are deemed impolite. Whereas, others disagree with it as this is somehow important. This essay will discuss both sides of the arguments and purpose my own opinion. Ċ On the one hand, cell phone talks on public premises are considered disturbing. Frequently, this practice can lead to misunderstanding communications among the community as those who are having mobile phone communications are often doing it too loudly. In addition, in some cultures, this is considered impolite. For instance, when a group of people is having a meeting then there is one of the members of the meeting picking a call and having a phone call talk. This is certainly distracting the focus of the meeting and tends to make others angry. Ċ On the other hand, the public argues that this is fine to have mobile dial communication if it is in an urgent situation. Individuals often get very important calls from a family that cannot be denied and avoided. For example, there might be one of the members of the family who have an accident in which he or she needs quick help from us. Therefore, taking a mobile phone call is needed and deemed okay. Ċ In conclusion, even though some people believe that having mobile phone conversations are fine to do in the middle of the public when it is in an urgent state, some others argue this is not allowed. I personally agree that talking on the phone in the middle of the crowd is deemed not polite and can lead to anger from people who get bothered by the talks."
9341,Some people feel that global warming should be dealt with by governments. Others feel that it is responsibility of individuals in society to solve the problem. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"To reduce the increased temperature due to humans’ activities on earth must be controlled with the contribution of different authorities, more precisely governments. However, some parts favoured this notion, while others have a counter-argument that to tackle the indicated severe issue, people have to take some initiatives. In my view, both have their importance in stopping global warming. Initially, my essay will demonstrate the role of government and then argue that public responsibilities towards it. Ċ To begin with, the uses of fossil fuels by the industries at large scale and exhaust fumes produce from various uses of private means by the people could be stopped when there will be solid law employed by the authority against overuse of these resources. Consequently, the public shall be inclined to control the overuse of these scarce properties due to the fear of high penalties. For instance, a recent survey has revealed that 40% of the pollution has been reduced only by following the law and orders imposed by the competent authorities. Therefore, applying legal terms can be the most impactful means to impede climate change. Ċ Nevertheless, it is also an individual’s responsibility to hold back the adversity in the earth’s climate caused by human actions. The significant contribution of people can be using the public transport rather than personal vehicles. Thus, the level of fumes discharged by the carriers shall be lessened as well as the damage to the environment. To illustrate, commuting by metro or busses not only helps to reduce the use of dangerous energy sources such as oil or gas but also solves the traffic congestion problem. Consequently, the environment-friendly practices assist in subduing the rise of temperature of the earth’s surface. Ċ To conclude, the government’s law could bring the expected changes in the society, and following these laws as responsible citizens could inert global warming. Overall, authorities and communities have to work simultaneously to solve the issues to get back to nature."
9342,People often do not interact with their neighbors and this is harming communities. What are the possible causes and solutions?,"a major concern of society is that people don't have any interaction with each other. This circumstance could lead to lots of unexpected consequences for communities. There are several causes for this problem and various approaches could be taken by governments and individuals. Ċ there are a variety of reasons why community have a tendency of being more introverted and passive. The most obvious reason is that with the development of high technology devices such as the latest version of a smartphone, crowd pursuit to possess one and be excited to discover its function. Being provided with a huge number of amazing app stores and thrilling game centres, humanity virtually is attracted and spend all of their leisure time staying indoors and sit in front of the screen.Moreover, they also have thought that it is unnecessary for them to go outside and make a short conversation with neighbours because messengers on Facebook or Skype enable them to keep in contact with close relatives such a far distance.Therefore, it is understandable that humanity preference is staying at home and enjoying their own rest of life. Ċ Fortunately, several measures could be taken to prevent this issue. The first solution is that the governments should encourage the civilians to do more outdoor activities. To gain this target, governments should allow to construct more stadiums and provide more sports equipment in order to appeal to citizens efficiently to meet and play together. For example, by building a new playground, the villagers could organise some sports events such as football or volleyball competitions that gain much attention of civilians. A second measure just depends on each individual that mankind should raise more awareness of the significant role of going outside and talking with neighbours so that they will be more extroverted and outgoing which are really helpful for their career or jobs. In addition, these activities also in order not to make such a tedious world with the lack of connection among society. Ċ In ,conclusion it is clear that there are various reasons for the lack of interaction of humanity and steps need to be taken to tackle this problem."
9343,"essay:some people think cultural heritage should be used to attract tourists and promote tourism,while some think that would damage cultural heritage.discuss.","Cultural heritages, like the old china culture，old India culture, the Maya culture, and so on, are the gift that the ancestor left to us. All of them show the development of human. How to make the gift more useful to the local society? Ċ A major number of people consider we could exploit the gift into the travel industry. In one hand, the traditional culture can better understand and appreciates by a wider range of those who travelling the places. In the other hand, national economy can benefit from the culture travel. Relevant business, such as traffic sector, shop sector, hotel sector, can have a deep development. Finally, it can enrich people's live from trip to different place.it is a good way for the people have a nice holiday after work. Ċ Nevertheless, some worried about it. They hold it will pollution the nation culture place, white trash can be saw everywhere in the place which were opened to the public, many trees were cut to build the hotel. Even more, some of the travelers like to carve their name at the place they had been to. And a large number of visitor also maybe a burden on the preservation of cultural relics. Ċ In my mind, use it to attract tourists is good to develop the country economy. Of course, cultural heritage may be damaged in someway, however, it can be avoided as long as the local government powerful regulation and supervisions. And we can limit the number of visitors in some special sites everyday."
9344,AI is likely to replace repetitive jobs Prompt: Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"Answer: The development of artificial intelligence has given rise to the fear that all occupations will one day be replaced by robots. This essay will argue that although some jobs may be automated, others cannot be done by machines. Ċ Dull and dangerous jobs are likely to be done by robots in the future. Robots that do repetitive tasks tend to require less complex programming and are, therefore, less expensive. They can be cost-effective tools to deal with monotonous tasks. In fact, some markets have already replaced cashiers with check-out machines. Artificially intelligent robots may also do work in toxic environments in the place of human workers. Ċ However, some other jobs can never be done by machines. One example is professions that require creativity. This is because robots only carry out program instructions; they cannot generate new ideas. For example, fiction writers are unlikely to lose their job to AIs, because creativity lies at the very heart of their profession. Also, innovative engineers who develop new features for robots will not be replaced. Ċ Jobs that entail high communication skills can only be done by humans, too. For instance, psychology consultants provide clients with emotional care. Requiring experience and sharp instincts, the job is unlikely, if not impossible, to be acquired by robots. Ċ To conclude, in the next few years, AI is likely to replace repetitive jobs at an intimidating speed. But this does not mean it will make everyone unemployed, because jobs that involve creativity and interpersonal skills cannot be automated."
9345,TOPIC: Developments in transportation such as automobile have had an enormous impact on society.Choose another development in transportation that you think is of great importance. Use specific examples and reasons for your choice.,"Transportation is one of the most important infrastructural factors determining the social development. From the very beginning up to now, automobile have in many ways had a significant effect on modern life. Another transport mean which can be regarded as a carrier to bring humanities to new epoch or to fulfill flying dreams is airplane. Ċ Some people think that flying costs are usually high. Besides, delays keep them hanging around the airports for a long time, wasting their time and making them tired. Moreover, some persons find airplanes unsafe, especially, in case of emergency, it's hard to protect people from danger. However, it's undeniable that people always receive what they're deserved. Everyone pays higher to receive faster journey and professional services on airplanes. Moreover, airports have always tried their best to well organize and reduce numbers and time of delays. Besides, airplane makers have been continuing innovating in designing safer, safer and safest airplanes. Ċ Additionally, since its first launch, aviation industry has always proven to be the leading solider in the fighting for social development. Airplanes shorten the distances between countries and even continents. This becomes a huge motive for the advance of international trades and worldwide political network. Ċ Furthermore, airplanes also facilitate increases in numbers of both local and oversea travelers all over the world. Flying usually saves a lot of time compared to other transportation means. For an instance, we have only 5 Vietnamese national holidays but wish to spend all the time in Canada, how can we achieve if we have to boat across a lot of continents and oceans to come there. Ċ In general, invention of airplanes facilitates a lot of advances in many fields ranging from normal life to trading and politics. Airplanes always bring the fastest, the most convenient and the most professional to passenger."
9346,"Some people say that excessive noise should be a criminal offence, while others say they should be free to make noise without limitation. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Some people argue that producing a high level of noise should be punished by law, while others argue that individuals should have liberty to make any amount of noise. In my opinion, the punishment should be given to the ones who make abnormal level noise. Ċ Any kind of nuisance such as, extreme voices, should be considered against the law. Firstly, Legal action should be taken against those who generate extreme nuisance voice. Secondly, Loud noises can be very disturbing to neighbours, the general public and even animals. Certain people don’t bother about others getting disturbed due to them. In such cases, excessively loud noises should be made punishable. For example, in Denmark, hospitals follow a strict no-roar policy and a person can be heavily penalized by legal if he makes too much sound. This has ensured the well-being of patients and visitors. Ċ However, some say that people should have the freedom to make as much roar as they like. It is wrong to assume that because every individual has a certain responsibility towards himself and others and must act in a way that does not harm anyone who is around him. They must be sensible and show empathy to others around them and this is their moral obligation. For instance, it is extremely inappropriate for a person to make too much roar in a funeral ceremony because it would show that he lacks empathy. He must, therefore, remain silent so that others do not get disturbed. Ċ In conclusion, making excessive sound should be punishable by law and no man should have the freedom to make as much roar as he likes. In my opinion, excessive sound should be a criminal offence to ensure that communities can co-exist peacefully."
9347,"Human activity has had a negative effect on ecosystems, animals and plants across the world. Some people believe this cannot be changes while others feel that we can still take action protect living things and the environment. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.","Human being actions have had a detrimental impact on the environment and the living beings on our planet. A large section of society support that ecosystem preservation can be done by monitoring the repercussions of our activities, whereas others oppose this. Firstly, I will discuss why people feel they can no longer help living things and the local environment, and secondly, I will describe what actions people are taking to benefit the natural world. Ċ Many people feel that environmental degradation increases due to rapid growth in industrialization in many parts of the world. Although, it has helped in rapid growth of developing economies, large quantity of waste is also produced by them. For example, some Asian countries produce goods for different parts of the globe, which in turn creates pollution, but also provide employment for the large section of society. Another reason people find themselves helpless to help the Earth is due to rising population levels. It becomes difficult to provide basic amenities without harming the ecosystem. Consequently, people become careless to preserve other living organisms. Ċ On the contrary, there are many people who agree that we can still protect our environmental bodies by using renewable energy and resources. Solar power is one such example that has no negative effect on the natural world. To exemplify, if we could use more natural energy resources, we can generate more power and electricity without impacting natural habitats. Moreover, many countries, such as India, are also now restricting the use of plastic bags. As a result, India’s cities and wildlife have become healthier and cleaner. Ċ To conclude, it is crystal clear that we are facing many challenges in protecting the natural surroundings. In my opinion, I strongly contend about ensuring the safety and life cycle of our planet, and feel that governments worldwide should make this their top priority."
9348,today many children spend a lot of time playing computer games and little time on sports. why is it? is it a positive or negative development?,"In modern life, video games have gained much popularity among the youngsters and children thanks to its relaxation and entertainment. There are many reasons for this phenomenon, but in my personal perspective, this development can be deemed as a negative change. Ċ Nowadays, many children are gluing their eyes to the screen playing games for various reasons. Video games are now becoming more and more diverse and attractive than they were in our parents' time (20-25 years ago), which draws many youngsters' attention. Indeed, gaming experience now is better for gamers. For instance, players are constantly given scores, new targets, rewards and achievements to keep them playing, which becomes an enormous temptation that users can not easily resist and it prevents them from exercising to improve their health. On top of that, to some unfortunate offspring who live in a dysfunctional family, computer games are considered a getaway from their anguish reality, deterring them from positive thinking and raising their optimistic thoughts. Ċ Besides, many problems arise around spending too much time on computer-based games that cannot be forecasted and underestimated. As said before, electronic games are lures that once users are trapped in, it is extremely difficult for them to get out. Lack of sports activities and physical exercises will bring many issues to gamers. Put it differently, wasting all day looking at a computer screen leads to various acute health problems. Weak eyesight, bad posture and obesity are the best illustration for this statement. In addition, spending all day in front of electronic devices also results in children's study severely, with no time for doing homework and revisions, their further study will be ruined, which significantly affects these people's future. Ċ In conclusion the rise of gaming and the decline in exercising are based on different reasons. Games can either be advantageous or not, depending on how the users utilize it."
9349,You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Ċ You should write at least 250 words.,"Since in the olden days, music has become a famous activity which most of the people like spending their time . In fact, even some academics believe that each younger ought to be learned on playing musical equipment. In my point of view, I agree with this statement as it would improve younger’s creativity and bring healthiness towards their mental health. Ċ To begin with, creativity is ones of the mental processes, which should be developed since childhood.For example, as children would be easier to be bored in one direct learning, music is the best way to attract them back in focusing their learning. Many studies have shown that being studying music would improve people’s imagination because it triggers the right and left side of the brain working together in time. As a result, by implementing children to play their musical items in school would lead to the empowerment of younger’s wisdom. Ċ In addition, playing musical items by the teenager would bring beneficially in their mental healthiness. In the contemporary world,for instance, it has becameChange the verb formbecomeIt appears that the verb became should be in the past participle form. Consider changing it. Ċ show examples a trait, which children have to struggle in studying many subjects. Clearly, it could contribute to the depression among this younger generation because this modern study system has put up the pressure in their early stage of life. Despite this stressful life, music should be learned to them for relaxing purpose and lessening their burden of study. Thus, implementing music in children’s studying become a need which would bring cheer over their faces and bring positivity for their mental condition. Ċ In conclusion, suggesting the teaching musical instrument toward children affect them on increasing their creativity and heathier mental status which people should be aware of in order for the betterment of the younger generation."
9350,"Topic 1: Traditional food is undergoing great changes and being replaced by new diets. What do you think are the reasons and what do you think about this? more imported food, less local cuisine?","With the multicultural integration, foreign cuisine takes an essential role in contributing to the diversity of that of one nation. It is inevitable that there will be a tendency of home- country food losing common preference due to the appearance of other new diets. Ċ Initially, this trend is accelerating in the result of the alteration of residents' appetites. Conventional food has been attached to the history and culture - factors that define the character of a society - since the early age. More or less, it is getting mundane to have these dishes on frequent occasions, esp. national holiday,.. so revolutionary diets are in need no matter what. At the same time, new diets with an innovative style of cooking and absolute time - saving capture all appetites immediately. This dietary with flavourful taste is undoubtedly more preferable than complex traditional ones. Ċ As a matter of fact, imported cuisine from the outsiders enhances the variety of food culture of a continent. However, if people adopt these renovations without embracing the original cuisine of their country, it will rapidly sink into oblivion. Besides, foreign diets also introduce fast food which accounts for obesity and other severe diseases if being misused. Nowadays, according to its convenience and tasty flavor, junk food satisfies many people from the young to the adults, from students to workers who have irregular working hours. Ċ In a nutshell, imported food has its benefits and it is people that decide if conventional dishes are forgotten or not. People have to learn how to balance their diets between two types of food consumption, adore the beauty of other nations' cuisine and maintain the long-term value of conventional food."
9351,"QUESTION: Every year rare languages disappear from the world. Some people say this is not important, because it is better to have fewer languages. To what extent do you agree or disagree? ANSWER:","Due to dominance of certain languages some rare language are fade away from the world every year. Some people believe that less language which has spoken by many people is better important than rare languages. I disagree with the statement that rare languages are not important and giving importance to have certain language. Having less language in the world helps to travel and communication easier but disappearance of rare language will weaken particular culture. Ċ Existence of less language helps people to travel and communicate easily around the world. For example, people can travel without anyone support to one country to another country if they have same language. It is comfortable to communicate with another country people if they have same language or they know his language. It is clear that having less language helps people travel and communicate better with another country and their people. Ċ On the other hand, disappearances of rare languages fade away its culture. Often language is related to culture. If it is fades then its culture also will fade. To illustrate, we know Sanskrit, it is one of the ancient language which was used by many ancient kings and people. But now it is disappearing and the culture related to it also diminish. It is clear that more language is also important to strengthen its culture. Ċ To conclude, rare language is important to have diverse culture and heritage to enrich world with different culture and customs. Having fewer language will show uniformity though communication and travel is easier but learning or respecting other culture and language is very important and strengthen brotherhood and integrity."
9352,Some people believe that a person’s criminal record should be removed when they reach the age of 18. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued that the people’s unlawful history needs to be abolished, after they attain the age of 18. I plainly agree with this notion because it can make them civilized, and will enhance their acceptability by others. This essay will discuss that how the decision presented above can be useful, with the reasonable example. Ċ Firstly, people can be relieved from the stress or the guilt due to their illegal past behaviour, if there is no visible documentation on it. In other words, they can freely start a new, fresh life, and become a good member of the society. As a result, when there will be no discrimination between normal public and the past prisoners, then the number of civilized citizens will gradually enhance. To exemplify, according to an article published in the New Age magazine, in 2016, in India, the numerous people struggle to obtain a suitable job owing to their felonious history. Ċ Secondly, when such a person is not liked or accepted by others, then the risk to commit a crime in the future increases. This is to say that the former criminals should be treated equally or just like any other normal person. Hence, it may improve their mentality, and the rate of crime will also decline. For instance, according to a survey conducted by the University of Solan, India, in 2018 more than 35% of prisoners started working in rehabilitation centres as volunteers after receiving clean chit from the jails. Therefore, the acceptance by the society improved, and also resulted in a decrease in the crime level. Ċ To conclude, it is certainly a great idea to clear the criminal data of a person, to enhance his or her acceptance in the society, and to make him or her more civilized."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Internet usage is becoming increasingly popular around the world. Some people post the information even after knowing that it is incorrect. Therefore, inaccurate information is being widely spread across. While I agree that our society gets wrong information, I also believe that many websites provide great sources of knowledge to all. This essay will discuss both views in detail. Ċ On the one hand, our community gets wrong information from online posts. All the people around the world use the internet as their first source of getting knowledge for any topic. Some individuals post their writings without analyzing the truth of the content. Thus, affects the citizen who read that particular article. For example, a recent survey conducted by the Rotary Club of Chennai mentioned that young adults are mainly affected by the incorrect information that is available on the internet. As a result, false data spread fast across the region. Ċ On the other hand, online sources provide great amounts of information whatever we search. Many websites provide precise data, and most importantly public ought to understand that not all the information available on the websites are true. People should read the information only on well-known sites rather than spending time on individual posts. For instance, the online search engine could provide all kinds of links and it is an individual responsibility to choose the right one. Therefore, misleading knowledge transfer can be avoided. Ċ In conclusion, though the internet plays an important role in providing information we look for, the negative aspects to be considered before passing on to others. It is the responsibility of everyone to spread correct information across."
9354,"Music is played in every society and culture in the world today. Ċ Some people think that music brings only benefits to individuals and societies. Others, however, think that music can have a negative influence on both. Ċ Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Music plays a vital role in an integral part of society.This has significantly made each individual as well as society beneficial. However, some people believe that it brings only positivity, while others think that it brings only negativity. I would discuss both views and give my opinion. Ċ First of all, Music has enhanced the field of creativity and spirituality for the well being of social and cultural values of today. For Instance, many youngers nowadays, listen to opera for relaxation and stress relief.This can be stated as they do their daily work with the help of melody. Most of the younger generation believe to aspire their physical interest by learning upcoming new trends which can suit their age groups. Secondly, spirituality plays a significant role in the welfare of older citizens. They listen to devotional songs to keep their body in the sounds of calmness as well as adhering to peaceful and silent environmental circumstances. Ċ On the other hand, music tends to affect the life of the younger generation as do not concentrate on their studies ,which can lead to poor academic performance. For example , many students as well as children nowadays, have their mobile phones with the latest music and they constantly listen to it thereby lose their focus on studies. Moreover, it can become an addiction as they listen every day. As students live in their own space, where no one can keep eye on them,Remove the commaapplyIt appears that you have an unnecessary comma before the dependent clause marker because. Consider removing the comma. Ċ show examples because nowadays students attend online classes on the mobile device. Ċ To Sum up, having looked at both sides of the view in my opinion, I believe that music has driven the world with all its feature with the soul of the mind. It is the responsibility of each and every individual in our society to look upon the beneficial aspects of singing and listen to music on free time as well as students should concentrate on their studies for their future endeavours."
9355,Today foods travel thousands of miles from the farm to the consumers. Ċ Why is this? Is it a positive or negative trend?,"Nowadays, the production process is widely spread among hundreds of countries. In turn, foods can travel a long distance in order to arrive at the needed shop. In this essay, I will examine the reasons for such a peculiar method and explain why I consider that this is a positive trend towards great outlooks. Ċ Each country has its unique technologies and techniques that benefit them a lot, especially, in businesses. Indeed, almost every nation has a field where they have achieved much more progress rather than all other countries combined. In Russia, for example, the farming aspect prevails. The wide farmers' community improved technics for gathering crops, and now they utilize them with a greater outcome that, in turn, yields lower prices for the final consumers. Thus, even though there are additional costs for transporting, this harvest, still brings much more profit not only for buyers but also for companies. Ċ I believe that this tendency has only a positive impact on a whole society. By specialising only in one particular market area, counties can develop innovations and find out about the most effective ways of production. In Canada, for instance, people came up with the more efficient factory equipment that contributes to a considerable decreasing in expenses including time and money while producing plant-based meat. Therefore, if each country innovates and incorporates something new, it will definitely contribute to the national economics and technological sphere too. Ċ In conclusion, given the fact that now food produced by different countries because of better performance, I feel that this strategy is promising and will lead to positive results within the technological and economical aspects on the horizon ."
9356,"It is often said that the subjects taught in schools are too academic in orientation and that it would be more useful for children to learn about practical matters such as home management, work and interpersonal skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","This is no doubt that all of subjects which includes academic-oriented subject and practical skills to be taught in school can bring more benefits to child in a modern society. Ċ Educationalist think it is very important to educate child to be a rounded individual as they believe the more opportunity of learning about traditional knowledge such as mathmatics and literature, the wiser mind to be developed in the long run. In addition, academic study is very powerful in the formation of mental discipline and sysmatic worldview in order to help the children make sound judgements about problems they may encouner in future. This is probably true to some extent. Ċ On the other hand, some people agree that teaching of practical matters prepare child better for their furture lives, especially in career life. From our own experience, we can find out plenty of evidence that individual who acquire practical skills, for instance, excellent computer skills, speak fluency bilingual lanuage as well as good interpersonal skills and so forth, are likely more competitive than their ordinary peers in the job market. Most of them can get a desirable job at mutli-national company with a high-salary needed by a comfortable life. Because of these advantageous, their path to the success of career is obvious. Ċ In conclusion, I think that the core responsibility of school is not only concentrate on teaching academic knowledge, which is essential at this point, but also providing them access to the specialised knowledge in the real world. The interaction of both sides can help child to become more talented and able person to a society.."
9357,"students in school or university learn more from classes of teachers than other resources (e.g. Internet or TV), do you agree or disagree?","Learning is a part of human growth and development and people learn all through their life. Pupils should focus more on lectures than other materials such as television or the web. I strongly argue with this statement and this essay will discuss the reasons in detail along with personal opinion in the end. Ċ To begin, undergraduates shouldn't only learn from the classroom because their knowledge expansion will decrease. To explain further, teachers only focus on the academic syllabus which consists only of theory whereas, a child can learn it in a more interesting way from other areas like commercials, youtube and educational resources online. For example, if a student wants to know about newton's law of physics besides the classroom, they can learn it practically from videos available all over the internet. So to conclude, students shouldn't restrict themselves to learning and growing from different aspects. Ċ In addition, less concentration on studies in large groups is another reason for not stopping scholars to study outside the campus through different sources. To explain, focusing on studies in a class is difficult as some pupils hesitate in asking questions or clearing doubts even if they haven't understood the lecture.Moreover, recent research has shown that 70% of school-going children study for their examinations from educational material present all over the internet rather than revising from their educator's notes. To sum up, opening various areas to grasp knowledge will enhance students' schooling Ċ In conclusion, Despite, all the advantages school have for children some people finds it boring and find other interesting ways to learn specifically apps and online tuitions. I completely disagree with the fact, that restricting students from extra resources other than classes of teacher will be a good option. In contrast, it will expand their knowledge and the education will be fun."
9358,# Modern technology has a great impact on our environment. Some say that people should adopt a simple lifestyle to solve the problem while others argue that the technology itself should provide a solution. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"Technology provides the plethora of benefits for the people. The bitter truth is that it's harmful for climate as well. Some segment of people accepts that it's all about the individual lifestyle and technology helped lot in control of the environment. But others believe in the opposite directions. I will discuss both of these views before forming an opinion. Ċ The new innovations are increasingly helping in the development of our nation, also the individuals are responsible to keep clean the surrounding. Of course, some of the people step in to control in managing electricity at their home by not wasting or over using. In addition to the individuals are polluting the air in some how. For instance, most of the people are going to office on a daily basis, but if they share their vehicles with others and obviously they can take benefit out of it such as saving cost and reduce air pollution. So individuals should have to utilize the machinery in a proper manner. Ċ On the other hand, Although the modern world raised by help of many innovations and using in our daily routine life, some of the people still wanted to tackle the environmental issues by itself. The new innovations are heavily involved in cleaning the location. For instance, our society members are just throwing the waste in the bin, however the machines are used to clear it and move out of living areas. So the modern automation somehow working for us to maintain the climate and there should be some portions of individual responsibility to neat and fit our environment. Ċ To conclude, our modern work running with the innovated mechanism and it gives the greater impact on our environment. Therefore, it is our joint responsibility to tackle the problem by simple lifestyle with the utilization of technology."
9359,Many of today’s urgent problems can only be solved through international corporation. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The world at large is currently facing tremendous crises. Hence, certain people feel that foreign alliance is the sole means of overcoming these immediate difficulties. In this essay, I will argue that these instant troubles cannot be exclusively resolved by a multinational partnership. Ċ In the course of the ongoing global economic meltdown, some countries have been terribly affected. As a result of this, several people have become redundant. Consequently, poverty, hardships, hunger, and starvation have prevailed and become the order of the day especially in developing countries. Fortunately, wealthy developed nations like the USA have gone a long way in helping these impoverished regions by lending them money. To illustrate, my country Nigeria has received lots of international monetary aid to help boost its economy in this period of recession. Ċ Despite the advantages associated with partnering with foreign nations to solve the acute hardships, the idea that it is the only means to obtain a solution is totally absurd. To begin, some nations have indigenous capabilities that need to be harnessed to enable independence in problem-solving. Therefore, transnational alliance will annihilate their solution finding potentials. Furthermore, foreign aids, especially monetary supplies can encourage corruption, as corrupt and greedy leaders will be prompted to embezzled money meant for resolving urgent problems facing their Nations. For instance, in this current COVID-19 pandemic, Madagascar looked inwards and came up with its own local remedy to fight the virus. Perhaps, if they had received monetary help, it might have been stolen by the government, just like in Nigeria. Ċ In conclusion, this essay argued that those who think that international connections is the only way to bring about a solution to the pressing crises of today are improvident. In my opinion, foreign corporations are not the sole means of resolving these urgent hardships."
9360,Some people believe that it is important to give gifts and presents to friends and family to show that we care about them others think there are better ways to show that we care about them discuss both ways and give your opinion,"It is true that our beloved ones should be given a great care of by us, since we love them. Moreover, this is the most important part of our life to show attention to our relatives and friends. In my opinion, however, there are more lucrative ways to show our affection, which I am going to discuss here. Ċ Firstly, while presenting gifts and presents make our beloved ones very happy, it is always difficult to guess what exactly they need. In addition, even if they show the joy when given presents, they would never tell you the truth about how these presents are liked. For instance, different surveys concluded that the majority of the presents after main holidays are being thrown as a waste. Although, giving gifts and presents is a fancy way to show the love, it is gradually becoming an outdated habit. Ċ On the other hand, if someone comes up with an alternative way to bring a joy to your friends and family, they can always add up a surprise to the action. In other words, rather than just giving a certain gift, one can present a gift card for a certain amount in order to enable your close ones to buy whatever they want to. For example, the recent Walmart statistics have indicated that the volume of the gift cards surpassed the volume of the actual presents in the last year. As a result, more and more popularity gain such presents as travel tickets and holiday packages, which the people generally happier than when giving them ordinary presents. Ċ In conclusion, the gift's market is growing day by day and there are many new alternatives to the habitual ways to bring joy to people. Hence, I personally strongly vote for the new path to make our celebrations better."
9361,Young generations prefer to marry and have children when they become 30 and above and they no longer start their marriage and family life at a young age. Do you agree with this?,"Nowadays, many people want to start their married life when they are in the age of thirties and thirty plus, they also prefer to do child planning near around this, and they do not wish to get married at an early stage. I opine the same view and the reason for this contemplation are manifold. In this essay, I will discuss two main issues behind this thinking of adolescents that why they do not hope for their wedding soon. Ċ In this competitive era, to achieve anything has become a tedious task. Similarly, to get a good job, it is essential to have higher levels of educational degrees. Therefore, in order to be successful, young people choose to finish their study first before their wedding. For example, in a recent survey done by the California University, seventy percent of the students in the master class are unmarried, and the reason filled in the questionnaire that they want to complete their education first with good marks which require a high level of concentration, and if they get married, it would be difficult for them to focus. Ċ Further, it is irrefutable that it requires a lot of money to run a family, and after completing the studies when young people get a job, it takes some time to reach for getting a good salary as they will become experienced. For instance, in my office a fresher gets rupees fifty thousand at junior level in the Accounts department, whereas the person who is acquainted with two -three years of knowledge in the particular field, he or she will get one lakh rupees. Therefore, as a fresher, it is easy to spend life with small earnings, but for married couples, it requires more money to meet certain fixed expenses and responsibilities when they will be having children. Consequently, youngsters prefer to procrastinate their wedding plans. Ċ To summarise, although it is needed to marry at a right age, there are certain constraints which are holding people to start their married life at a little later stage so that they are settled and have a good bank balance in their bank accounts when they will marry with someone."
9362,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents' job.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"It's true that a variety of people agree children should do similar jobs like their parents when they grow up, however, I doubt this agreement since I believe that children will gain more disadvantages from this career plan. Ċ Firstly, some people believe children can achieve more relying on their parents' help, whereas I think independence is the most important thing when people grow up that everyone are supposed to know how to choose a school, make a career plan and so many things by their own when they are facing to the whole society. Children, however, are more likely to lose the chances to make their own decision about career because they do the same job like parents who may use their rich experience to arrange all things for their kids. Then children just do it step-by-step without thinking, and a few years later, they will not able to do some critical choices without others' help. Ċ Additionally, I believe that all men created differently, which means no one could say children must have the same interest with their parents. For example, it's not surprise that scientists' children have no passion about experiment and calculation. Thus, it's necessary and important for children to find their own interest which might be totally different from their parents' so that they would have more career probability in the future. Ċ Admittedly, children are able to solve problems easily and take a shortcut with their parents' experience and interpersonal relationship which indicates that they might have more chances to get a prompt and success while the children whose parents cannot provide such advice and guidance have to do extra effort. Ċ All in all, I deem that children should make their own decision and achieve their own dream, instead of just following their parents' footprint."
9363,"topic:some people believe that children should learn science in school,others think that it is not necessary to include science in general education. Do you agree or disagree?","Through the ages,people benefit a lot from the progress of science, which make a necessity of introducing science in school education.while others support the contrary,it is my personal belief that,to a large extent,basic science knowledge is essential for the further development of children. Ċ There seems to be a evident tendency that science course is increasingly popular among educational institutions and public schools. Obviously, the main factor due to this trend is science as basic education lay a solid groundwork for other sophisticated subjects,such as biology or physic, which involve numerous principals and laws originating from science. Moreover, if students had no access to acquire science knowledge from schools, they would misunderstand the reality of science;since it is awashed with excessive false information about science,be it on newspaper,TV or Internet. On top of that, school education is the prime opportunity to encourage and spirit children to explore science; therefore,school education would play a overriding role in fostering elits in field of science. Ċ However, there is no getting around the fact that some students rarely have interest in science. A telling example to illustrate this point is artists, who have neither talents nor ambitions in this respect. Yet, it is undeniable that basic science would enhance profound understanding in no matter which sphere, even in art. Ċ On the whole, with the importance of science has been attached to our education, I would be hard-impresses to imagine that children are able to be better-rounded in absence of science course."
9364,Every one of us should become a vegetarian because eating meat can cause serious health problems. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the modern world, the tendency to stop eating meat has seen a long-term gradual increase. While some people believe that all humans should follow a vegetarian diet, I completely disagree with this statement. The following essay will examine the beneficial aspects of an omnivorous diet and the drawbacks of being a vegetarian in order to support my point of view. Ċ To begin with, one predominant nuance, which detracts from the benefits of cutting down on animals products, is that this movement entails the lack of B12 vitamin in our body. In other words, vegetables,fruits and legumes do not contain an adequate amount of this micro-element to maintain our skin and body healthier, and by choosing only this for a daily menu a person can impact his well-being. For example, it was revealed that B12 deficiency occurs to the damage of the nervous system, as this element is one of the mandatory parts for its support. As a result, a vegetarian diet can be potentially harmful to people. Ċ In addition, meat and seafood are high in protein, which is essential for people's health. To put it differently, these products consist mainly of this vital nutrient, so by removing beef or poultry from a daily diet, a person will potentially face a possessing issue with building and maintaining his muscles. To illustrate this, a multitude of sportsmen are following a special diet, which is based on chicken or seafood consumption, and it drastically helps them to stay stronger and obtain brilliant results in the gym. Thus, an omnivorous diet has a positive impact on our shape, whereas a vegetarian one can probably exacerbate our body's state. Ċ In conclusion, we are all too familiar with the pressing social dilemma of cutting down on animals products. While there is an opinion that all of us should opt for this, I do not support this view. As for me, a vegetarian diet can lead to the lack of protein and B12 vitamin, which are vital for our well-being, and it is better to have a diverse daily menu whichCorrect pronoun usagethatIt seems that there is a pronoun problem here. Ċ show examples includes meat."
9365,Hope that someone can correct my mistakes and give some suggestions. Students are more influenced by their teachers than by their friends.,"It is hard to say who are more influent in student's decisions. Generally speaking, I believe that there are two different phases in student's lives. In other words, in high school friends are more influents and in under graduation professors are more influents. Ċ First of all, it is important to consider that in high school students are in a very rebellious period. Students do not listen teacher's advices. Of course, at this time families suffer more with this typical behavior because they have the responsibility to advise them. For example, in high school students are teenager and because of that they want to be accepted by the group of friends. Therefore, they prefer to imitate their friends despite of their teachers and family. Ċ In under graduation they are more mature and professor are more influent than friends. I will be the first to admit that at the beginning parties are very common in student's life but in the middle though the end of the university our priorities change and we are more concerned to our profession life. For example, when I was at university in my city I vividly remember I used to talk with my professor about career. The most important professor I had was my advisor who influenced me to attend master degree and be a professor in the future. Ċ To conclude, based on the arguments exposed above, I am of the opinion that it depends on which phase the student are. In high school, friends have more influence because student's priorities are not be a good professional while in under college it is."
9366,It has become easier and more affordable for people to visit other countries. Is it a positive or negative Ċ development?,"Our society has been experiencing a tremendous change in the tourism industry. Gratifyingly, people tend to be provided easy access to other countries with low expense during travel. This essay will demonstrate both merits and demerits of this trend. Ċ On one hand, such an undemanding way to take a journey to a non-domestic region has multiple benefits to individuals and the local community. Firstly, when visiting a foreign country, people would frequently encounter many cases such as ordering meals in other languages, navigating to unfamiliar places, and unexpected situations to tackle, through which one might realize how resourceful and capable he/she could be. Therefore, valuable perspectives brought by a fantastic trip can be easier to obtain. Secondly, compared with the past, cheaper and convenient flights and accommodations have attracted individuals to travel around, which can stimulate demand for products and services like purchasing souvenirs and booking tickets, thus contributing to economic growth. Ċ On the other hand, a deluge of visitors can be devastating the local environment as they may litter everywhere or mark some facilities. These behaviours might put a heavy burden on the environment. As a matter of fact, the most inaccessible scenic spots, for example, Mount Everest, have not escaped human-generated waste. However, I would argue that such an ongoing plight can be changed, thanks to the boom of tourism. It is because more and more authorities have recognized the sustainable tourism hinges largely on a tidy and neat environment. Although people have a chance to choose an affordable trip, the place may not be with garbage-engulfed corners and damaged facilities. Ċ In conclusion, many countries have provided visitors with more affordable flights, accommodations, and other travelling fees for other services. Various pieces of evidence have been gathered to prove that it has several positive effects not only for travellers themselves but also for the economic growth in these countries. Moreover, I believe the local government will implement more effective measures to save and guarantee the beauty of the scenery."
9367,Some people believe that it is a good idea that older people continue to work if it is possible for them to do. Do you agree or disagree ?,"It is believed by some that continuing to work after getting retired could be a positive choice for a number of elderly people, as long as it is possible for them. I tend to agree with this argument and I will explain more details in the following essay. Ċ On the one hand, elderly people might find it thrilling to pursue their occupation after retirement. Spending most of their time at home, they might experience a feeling of being useless as well as becoming depressed. As a result of this feeling, they might find it difficult to interact with their family and friends. To illustrate, my grandfather, who was a manager of a huge and renowned company, didn't communicate with us and spent most of the time in his room after retirement. Ċ On the other hand, being retired, older people have the chance to relax and do their favourite activities which they didn't have the time to do as an employee. For instance, they can read more books and spend most of their time with their relatives. Thanks to retirement, they have more time to enjoy their friends' company. Moreover, as we are all aware, older people should have a healthy lifestyle, which is challenging to perform while they continue to work. Ċ To sum up, pursuing one's occupation is considered as an excellent choice for people who have the potential and also interest. I feel that continuing to work regardless of one's age could be a good decision; however, this is as long as the elderly people be aware of their physical and mental abilities."
9368,Many parents think that it is good to teach children about the value of money .Whydo you think it is important to teach them the value of money? In what ways can you help children learn the value of money?,"Parents commonly believe that teaching their offspring the importance of money is a good thing. In my opinion, I completely accord with this notion. The reason for this as well as ways of educating them shall be elucidated in the forthcoming paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, an eminent adage, ""Teach a child where he must go and when he grows old, he will not depart from it."" In other words, parents must be mentoring their children as early as possible especially when it comes to matters that would affect their future, on how they handle things on their own. Money, for example, when not spent properly might be detrimental to one's life since it can cause a lot of evil as they say. If a child does not know the value of a coin, then he will grow up extravagant, luxurious and out of control. Moreover, he will be irresponsible and might be wasting expenses with nonsense gadgets. Therefore, young minds must learn how to allocate funds. Ċ Helping children understand the expenditures of the family might be challenging, however, it is not impossible if they see a good role model. First, elders should involve young members of the family in deciding what to buy for their daily needs considering the budget allotted for each month. Second, students must not be given extra cash or gifts unless they have achievements. The best clear example is when they top the exam, then they will have an ice cream treat. And last but not the least, once in a while, youngsters must be brought to work so that they will see the hardships and sacrifices their parents are doing in upbringing them. Hence, through these methods, children will learn the value of money. Ċ In conclusion, it is therefore crucial for elders to teach young people the relevance of money because it has a significant impact on their future and there are several ways for them to learn. Furthermore, we all should spend our money wisely and be a good example in the eyes of innocents."
9369,"""If you could travel back in time to meet a famous person from history,what person would you like to meet? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.""","If I could meet a famous person form history, this definitely would be Thomas Edison. His inventions changed the history and the way people live nowadays. I would learn lots of thing from him and this would motivate me in my future work as electronic engineer. Ċ Thomas Edison originated the generation and implementation of electric power. This was crucial invention for the modern industrialized world. I can hardly imagine what would the world be now, if there wasn't electricity. Ċ In addition to the electrical generation, Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, which was great implementation of the electrical energy. Before his discovery, this type of energy was known to people, but there wasn't any practical usage of it. After that, every singe man on the planet could take advantage of having light all night long. Ċ Furthermore, Edison invented the telegraph - the forerunner of all well known telecommunication systems. Without his inventions, there would be neither television nor internet. I want to know what made him to think in this direction, why he devoted his time to work for something, which was considered impossible. Ċ All in all, the inventions of Thomas Edison are great push for science and I consider him one of the greatest men in written history. I would like to meet him and talk about his thoughts and what inspired him. This would be a breath-stopping experience, which would motivate me to learn more about electricity and electronics."
9370,Task: Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.,"Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant. Ċ Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own. Ċ Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective. Ċ In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations."
9371,"Some people believe that touristsdo not learn anything during their holidays, while others believe that they learn a lot. Discuss both sides .","Whether or not tourists acquire something during their itinerary has become a controversial issue.While a vast majority of people are of the opinion that acquisition by visitors is negligible, there are some who opine that they grasp a variety of things throughout their visit.This essay will discuss both sides of the argument in depth. Ċ On the one hand, there is a section of the society who completely ignore any type of learning by tourists. Since they spend most of their time in sight-seeing and quite rarely interact with the locals of the region.Consequently, they get a little idea about their lifestyle and culture.For instance, most of the foreigners stay in, hotels or resorts, throughout their visit and look only for tourist attractions. Therefore, the advocates of this perspective are right in thinking that about the process of acquiring knowledge about the customs and traditions of certain tourist spots. Ċ On the other hand, there are some who favours the phenomenon that tourists gain ample opportunities of knowing new things.This is probably due to the reason that whenever they plan their vacations, hiring tour guides is a common activity that provides opportunities to learn historical facts with the help of associated stories.This broadens their horizons and adds to their knowledge.For example, if individuals from various countries, such as the USA and UK, arrive in India to admire the beauty of the Taj Mahal and other historic buildings, then these guides provide extensive information to them and help in making their journey memorable. Ċ To conclude, despite being a debatable issue that travellers attain something or not during their visit.It is considered by many that they acquire nothing, whereas others argue that these people learn a variety of things.This topic discussed the numerous causes for the varied perspective."
9372,In many countries women are allowed to take maternity leave from their jobs during the first few months after the birth of their baby. Do advantages outweigh disadvantages?  Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Except from the usual holidays, women are special groups who enjoy an extra benefit, that they are allowed to have maternity leave if they give birth to babies. Although many folks take this for granted, employers might not think in the same way, for there may obviously be disadvantages to hire a female employee. For me, it depends on what kind of companies women employees are in. Ċ The downsides to hire a female employee is rather evident. For employers, having people who are familiar with the details of the jobs work for them is vital. Otherwise it may not be able to complete these jobs of great importance, leading to a considerable loss of the company. However, females need a large amount of time to give birth. Besides, women often play a primary role in taking care of newborn babies, which distracts their attention from their work even after their returns. Ċ On the other hand, females overtake males in some situations. A man is deemed to be more aggressive than a woman in a traditional view. Therefore it is more likely for men to change their jobs and pursue more promising ones. By contrast, being grateful to their boss because of their maternity leave, women swear their loyalty to their company, and therefore are more trustworthy. Ċ To summarise, women do have drawbacks in terms of their absence from the jobs, while for companies that emphasise stability, women are more reliable than men."
9373,"Due to the influence of worldwide media such as television and computers, the gap between cultures is decreasing. The introduction of this global culture is a great benefit to the world. To what extent do you agree with this viewpoint?","It is no doubt true that technology has reduced the size of the world. To this effect, some are considering global culture has been beneficial to the continent. In my opinion, I totally disagree because it makes the place boring and the economy could be laid back. Ċ Firstly, imbibing a single custom globally could make the entire land uninteresting. That is to say, nothing would fascinate anyone on the other side of one's present location. Although in the past and currently, people looked and are looking forward to going to places to explore the tradition of others but, when this is synchronized, the excitement and morale would be deadened. Due to these unpleasant outcomes, it would be preferable to continue to have diversities of culture. Ċ Lastly, the financial status of the world might crumble. In other words, funds realised from tourism as a result of people travelling to places will decline when culture is amalgamated. Since there would not be any new experience on the other side, neither an excitement not fin to catch, citizens will remain where they are and a huge amount of money will be lost as this unfolds. For instance, the Ministry of Tourism in Nigeria reported that the money Nigerians spend on travelling alone is about 65%of the total budget for the year. Therefore, the countries enjoying these funds would longer do when the harmonization is affected, hence, a decrease in the economy of such places. Ċ In conclusion, in spite of people's views about the importance of globalization of the traditions I have a contrary opinion because of the fact that traditions will be extinguished the and it might be a disservice to the economy."
9374,A job should mean a job for life. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"A job is the way we earn a living or even the way supporting our future . As analysed above, I completely agree with the statement. Ċ Generally, a job is the thing that everyone wants to have after their graduation, it can be from the university or school and so on. It really depends upon their circumstances. However, all of them have the same objective. It is to create a sustainable career in order to survive in this cruel world. By way of an illustration, I can recall a random guy who is still studying at school since the only way to acquire a proper job is to have proper qualifications. Ċ Moreover, our life cannot go well with everything without money for the reason that we might catch a cold or some hazardous unexpected diseases. And a job is the first and the last way to obtain money to prepare us for the contingency and for the current time simultaneously. Despite this possibility, numerous people attempt to rely on the government's aid or on their insurance. However, it is not the most stable solution for your life anyhow. Since you always have to rely on your own instead of waiting for somebody to help you. To clarify it, imagine yourself being sick and alone. Subsequently you must have an enough amount of money to cure yourself. The money from the government will not be always in time. Sometimes, government will not even support you since you are not the only person on this planet are sick. Ċ By way of a conclusion based on the arguments explored above. I have a strong belief that our job means our job for our life. Because, It plays a huge role in our career. Furthermore, it provides us with precious thing such as money. Which can reinforce us in tremendous challenging situation that might about to happen prematurely."
9375,"Some teachers say students should be organised into groups to study, while others argue that students should be made to study alone. Tell the benefits of each study method. Which one do you think is more effective?","It is necessary that teachers not only aim to teach students the school curriculum but also help them to develop teamwork skills as well as the efficient way of individual study. However, this raises a certain concern as to whether students should be instructed to study in groups or alone. Though, both methods have their own benefits which need to consider carefully. Ċ First of all, studying in groups is crucial to enhance cooperated skills for students which is required in the future careers. When students discuss with their friends under the instruction of teacher, their personal communication will be enhanced considerably. As when listening to different views, they will know how to cooperate efficiently and respect to other people' views. Furthermore, teamwork is the essential skill that each candidate needs to practice prior to applying in any company. Therefore, not only acquisition theory, students also need to practice in a cooperative environment in their early ages. Ċ On the other hand, students also need to enhance individual study skills which will reinforce their independent mind. They will not be interrupted while studying and can concentrate completely on their ideas. Also, if they study by themselves, teacher can realize more easily students' deficiencies and find the most suitable instruction for individuals' capacities. Hence, students need to spend time studying by their own to acknowledge their mistakes and current level. Ċ To conclude, although both methods have their own advantages, I personally believe, students should study in groups rather than studying by their own thanks to the necessary teamwork skills for their future occupation. Simultaneously, it is advisable that students should use others' ideas flexibility to broad their perspective rather than depending too excessively and do not have their own position."
9376,"in many countries, the rich are becoming richer and poor are becoming ‎poorer.Why is this a problem?What solutions are there to tackle this ‎problem?‎","Undoubtedly, it goes without saying that the affluent population are leading more luxurious lifestyles and the underprivileged public are seeing more poverty in numerous countries. This disquisition delves into the details of why this kind of development is not welcoming and subsequently will advance some panacea to halting this menace. Ċ Apparently, one of the rationals, why it is a predicament, is being said that a nation can only see the progression if every individual of the society procures the basic needs of life successfully namely: food, shelter, primary education, and satisfactory employment, instead of being a slave of an opulent classed people. Unfortunately, this trend is so popular in a plethora of underdeveloped territories because wealthy people ruled over the destitute; consequently, the establishment of a province is almost impossible although putting hard efforts. To epitomize, one survey by GNA (Guardian Newspaper of America), states that the western part of Nigeria facing the most poverty in the world due to the exploitation of impoverished juvenile by prosperous entrepreneurs. Thus, such a direction should not become ubiquitous. Ċ Conversely, could there any wonder drugs to solve this peril? Certainly, it follows that the authority should take the strictest measures by enforcing laws and punishments to strike a balance between the poor and the rich standard. The justification might be to render all essential amenities to everybody, including poverty-stricken population as they are also part of the nation; hence, it is the uppermost responsibility of a government to take care of their rights and to make sure they get enough respect, at least at a national level. For exemplification, to maintain a balanced progression of a local area, the wealthier crowd should pay more taxes, which could be used to help the indigent public's academic and medical expenses. Ergo, a local community can be developed as a whole rather than a particular section of that society. Ċ To conclude, having explored both standpoints, it is evident that this tendency could be a stumbling block since the nation can not grow up with a sense of unity. Nonetheless, executives should insist on unbreakable rules to dwindle down the discrepancy between poor and rich folk."
9377,You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Television dominates the free-time of too many people. It can make people lazy and prevent them from socialising with others. Ċ Do you agree or disagree? Ċ You should write at least 250 words.,"A considerable proportion of citizens consumes most of the leisure period on telecasts which deprive them of an active and conversational lifestyle. I strongly coincide with the former declaration, and this essay will hold the reasons for my view. Ċ To commence, the idea of a sedentary life enhanced by television has numerous negative repercussions on the physical aspect of an individual. In other words, people are normally addicted to certain habits where allow them to sit for long hours without moving a single finger. Moreover, they may encounter severe health problems due to uncautious consumption hours for television. As reported in the Stay Fit magazine, the majority of obesity cases are originated from visual advertisements that incentivise consumers to eat frequently. Thus, there are various detrimental effects for seated life systems in front of a screen. Ċ Another compelling reason to support my view is that digital channels embrace the notion of public separation. This means that each person creates a personal space that abandons relationships and social interactions with familiar surroundings. Furthermore, some media programs publish specific materials related to violence in order to favorise human isolation toward others. To demonstrate, my family possesses three televisions because every member generally prefers to see his private show instead of exercising group activities. Hence, television divides expansive communities into tiny units. Ċ To summarize, a convenient number of people is replacing physical activities and moral relationships with a flat electronic machine. I totally agree with this statement because they are digitally seduced by individual immobility and social discrimination."
9378,More and more people claim that modern work patterns are a source of stress. What do you think are the causes of this? Can you suggest some possible solutions?,"Stress is pervasive in our modern society. Such physical and mental problems are inexorable results of temporary work patterns which have formed stressful lifestyle of modern generation. Ċ Resolution can be made by the corporation of individual awareness and management in changing work patterns. Ċ Employees are always put under pressure of efficiency and productivity. Even the ability to work under high pressure becomes a criterion employers require for a job. Modern work environment is highly competitive and it calls for relentless effort of every individual. To achieve goals, workers have to devote almost all of their time and capacity without rest. As a result, they are to busy to care about their beloved, even about themselves and time for relaxing or for their own interest sounds luxurious. High-demanding jobs like chief executive, directors, managers are typical of stressful jobs. Ċ On the other hand, work is not totally responsible for such prevalent stress. Appropriate work schedule can help employees to finish work without sacrifice precious time for their private lives. Time management skill is the top important prerequisite for that reason. Human resource management plays essential role in coping with stress. Short break is proved to be effective tactic to improve productivity and work efficiency. Companies should encourage their employees by vacations, rewards and the managers' role in forming amiable work environment is not less significant."
9379,"Nowadays, most people try to balance between work and other part of lives. Unfortunately, not many achieve this balance. what are the problems of this? Suggest some solutions.","The work-life balance for modern society is becoming an unachievable task even after putting more efforts into it. Initially, this essay will suggest that the biggest complications by this circumstance are less quality time with family and health issues and then it will argue that decreasing the number of working hours and doing regular exercise are the most viable solutions. Ċ To begin with, the predominant issue caused by imbalance life-work activity is that there is less hour for family members. Most of the employees are spending 10 to 11 hours in their workplaces and then at the commute. As a result, their family bonds become weaker and might be the cause of separation or divorce in couples. For instance, a survey conducted recently by BBC News has revealed that more than 33% of the world's newly married couples have filed their divorce cases due to spend less quality time together. Furthermore, several mental and health diseases such as fatigue, strain, obesity, high Cholesterol and so forth are generally developed in today's human. Consequently, they unable to give sufficient progress in their work. Therefore, many workers are unsuccessful to achieve a suitable home and office environment because of a hectic schedule. Ċ Nevertheless, a myriad of effective solutions can be employed to mitigate these problems. Firstly, the office hours should be limited by the employer instead of long hours. Thus, employees will be able to join their family a little early in the evening to spend a good time with them. Secondly, to avoid any kind of unpleasant unhealthy condition people should join gyms or take part in social activities. Accordingly, it will help to release stress and provide the required energy to the body. For example, American researchers found that many entrepreneurs are interested to go on a long drive to get relaxation. Hence, quality time for themselves and others might be the best remedies. Ċ To conclude, imbalance work-life can be the cause of the destruction of personal life in different ways. However, spending less time at offices and also giving priority to health and family can be the most productive measures to solve these problems."
9380,"International sporting events such as the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup provide an outlet for patriotic feelings, and help reduce international tensions. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","In recent years, lots of international sporting events have been organised by international organisation in order to raise patriotic feelings and to reduce international tensions. While I agree that the events have essential purposes, I firmly argue that it can influence the audiences who watch the events. Ċ International sporting events are important as they can build better relationship amongst countries. South Korea and North Korea, for example, were in a football competition (World Cup) - they had been in conflict for years - and they showed to the world that they have become friendly each other. All in all, World Cup has been successful to reduce international tensions. Ċ Apart from those tangible benefits, while a few countries, particularly players, have been in a friendship, international sporting events sometimes raise conflict from supporters when their favorite team is lost. For example, some Indonesian supporters protest when Indonesian football team could not win in Asean Games. As a result, this condition will increase their tensions. To sum up, the events do not always provide positive effects in this planet, but sometimes cause dire effects. Ċ In conclusion, it is evident that although international sporting events can give an outlet for patriotic feelings and attempt to reduce international tensions, they also probably result in dire effects such as raise international conflicts due to the supporter. It is imperative that all people, players and supporters in particular, should be supportive and responsible to the events."
9381,"Open plan office no walls no barriers. Research has shown that the transportation of products and people are the main source of pollution. Some people believe government should be in charge of this, while others believe it is the fault of individuals. Discuss both view and give your opinion.","Nowadays, issues relating to the environment caused by the transit of humans and merchandise are becoming more and more emerging, especially environmental pollution. While some assume that this is due to the misleading of the government, there are opinions that blame the problems on each citizen. From my perspective, it is both the government and people that share the same responsibilities for protecting our atmosphere from being contaminated. Ċ First of all, at the governmental level, it is essential to collect precise data on how polluted the environment is because of all kinds of transportation. Only by publicizing the figures that have been worsening the situation will all people be aware of the risks which the whole nation is facing with. Therefore, the government, by carrying out research, is completely able to measure the exhaust released by the vehicles into the air. This enables the authority to provide proper strategies for the citizens to minimise the ongoing circumstance. For instance, if the poisonous gas is discharged in a great amount, then reducing the number of vehicles is required. Promulgation to awaken the consciousness of saving the surrounding air is crucial. Regulations on the encouragement of public transports are also an appropriate measurement to be considered. Ċ Secondly, each person needs to perceive that they are contributing to a better future with their small actions. They may not be capable of comprehending every aspect of the situation; however, via the information provided by the authority, they will understand the significance and follow the lead. For example, instead of shipping goods regardless of the quantity, merchants can make sure that each delivery is at its maximum capacity. In addition, the travelling of individuals, as mentioned above, can take place via the public transport system. Buses or high-speed rails are suitable and effective alternatives. Each one, with their correct perception, can have a positive influence on the world they are living in. Ċ In conclusion, both the national administration and citizens should join hands together to lower the negative impact of all kinds of transit. As a matter of fact, it is the interaction between the parties that leads to the better protection of the residence."
9382,"A university notices some first-year have poor studying skills. Some in the university believe all first-year students should be required to take a course on studying skills, but others don't agree. What is your opinion?","Being a student take skills to study, besides entering a whole new environment to study. Some people suggest that all of the first-year students should take a course of study skills, still, others disagree with the idea. However, in my opinion, I don't think taking one course is effective to help student study. Ċ To begin with, not all of the students use the same way to study. One function is helpful for some students, but the same function may be ineffective way to another student. On the other hand, different subjects also need to study in different ways. For example, I always recite in history class to get good grades, yet once I recite in the math test, I almost failed the test. I think there are a lot of ways to study, one course may teach skills how to study, but that may not be the best way. Ċ Furthermore, finding the skills to study is another ability for students to learn. After graduating from school, there is much more new stuff for social freshmen to explore. It is also a new environment to learn, but there's no teacher to teach. People may get panic or depress if they didn't train for learning new things by themselves before. So I think it is a good time for people to explore in university. Ċ By the way, taking another course for an unnecessary class may be a stress for new students. If it is not so valuable to take this class, new students need to use their study time to take this course. It may lead the new students to condense their time on studying the main subjects. So their score may be lower. It causes the opposite effect. Ċ To sum up, I think it's not a necessary course for first-year students."
9383,"Once children start school, teachers have more influence than parents on their intellectual and social development. Do you agree or disagree?","It is said that, at the commencement of elementary learning, teachers have greater influence more than the parents on the intellectual as well as social development of the children. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this idea, and this essay will further discuss how children pay more attention to tutors because of the fear and respect also how persons assigned to teach pupils help to mould their characters while developing socially. Ċ Firstly, at the onset of preschool, teachers inspire children to pay adequate attention interacting compared to their parents. This is because, more hours of the day are spent with the tutors, therefore creating a level of fear and respect. As a result of this, some form of discipline is instilled in the scholars which influences their reasoning intellectually. For instance, my niece, would not respond whenever she is being taught basic alphabets at home. As soon as she got enrolled in a school, she could recite a quarter of the alphabet without support accurately. Ċ Also, persons assigned to teach ensure good character images are emulated by students more than their parents do. This is due to the fact that, the tutors instruct these young scholars on composure, how to relate to fellow students, cleanliness as well as good manners. This might not be feasible with parents because of the familiarity. For example, while growing up, my class teacher took us through courses relating to manners and neatness and would thereafter choose the best behaved and neatest pupil by the end of the week. This motivated the students and soon became a culture to always appear neat and well mannered especially at social gatherings. Ċ To sum up, after the above analysis, it is clear that teachers have more impact on the lives of students more than their parents. Thus, ensuring they are well socially and intellectually developed."
9384,Young people should spend more time on cultural activities such as music and theatre and less time on sport. How far do you agree with this statement?,"Many people believe that the young had better pay more attention to cultural activities instead of sport. However, in my opinion, they do not review all aspects of this statement so i completely disagree with this view. Ċ It could not deny that nowaday, many culture activities become out-of-date. They do not fit the modern lifestyle of adolescences. In twenty-first century, the world changes rapidly everyday that makes young people have to interpret its system and socialise more. Humans currently are getting busier and working harder, quicker so they can not waste their time on something that has not been interesting enough or not help their career. Furthermore, sports make people communicate, helps they relax after long time of working and especially they are fashional. On the other hand, almost cultural activities are too slow comparing to the fast movement of sports, active people are easy to pick the second choice. Ċ Moreover, sports have many health benefits to everybody. Firstly, it aids for cardiovascular system. A lot of researchers show that playing sports can reduce some diseases such as: having a headache, broke or diseases related to the heart. Secondly, taking part in a sport might build your better body. It helps maintain the accurate weight and make you look sexier. Finally, scientists point out that the brain receives many advantages when people playing sports. This prevents lots of dangerous diseases like alzermer or losing memory and boost the Iq level. Ċ To conclude, sports play an important role in the young,s life and people should spend more time on them. Therefore, by any way, taking more time on cultural activities such as music and theatre despite of sport is unnescessary."
9385,Topic: You have enough money to purchase either a house or a business. Wich would you choose to buy? Give specific reasons to explain your choice.,"As human beings, with limited resources, we are daily confronted to making choices. One most important of them is about money matters, how to manage and use it in a way that benefit us. There are numerous opportunities in which one can invest his financial resources. In my view, it seems more useful to purchase a business. Ċ There is no doubt that owning a company makes people wealthy. In fact, by investing in a business we will annually ripe interests that can be reinvest in the same company or by buying shares from other companies. Consequently, the more investments grow, the more our benefits do. This explains why, more governments nowadays tend to advice unemployed youth to start their own business. Moreover our recent decade is rife with narrative about people you start from light financial resources but has become billionaires by making smart investment. It seems clear to spend money in enterprises if we want to become wealthy. Ċ Another good point for purchasing a company is that this makes people feel more independent and responsible. Leading a company is synonym with freelance, because you are the one who conceive and design the conformation and composition of your staff according to your plan and without constraints. Also people have to refer to your consentment before taking any actions. Ċ In conclusion I strongly believe that a profitable way of making use of our financial resources is by purchasing a business. It is truly the path to become quickly and consistently rich. And finally it makes us less stressed and more independent."
9386,"Air travel only benefits the richest people, majority people take no advantage from development of airplane.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Almost as soon as the aircraft was invented, people have never stopped their efforts in air traveling industry. Far less certain, however, is whether the endeavor in the development of airplane is particular served for wealthy minority or the normal majority? Ċ While it is unclear if the progress achieved in the airline industry can actually change the lives of common people, it does decrease their cost of air travel for them. The intense competition between the different airline companies resulted from the advanced airplane manufacturing technology, forces the companies to offer discounts in air fares to stabilize their original market and attract new customers. Therefore the available cheap tickets expand the choices of majorities who focus on economical travel rather than the efficiency. In addition, the convenience of short-time travel provided by airplane is preferred to long-time journey on train when it comes to long-distance. Furthermore, as improvement of the people's living quality, air travel is no longer the privilege of rich people. Even some economical airline companies accentuate their target on ordinary people with advertising of low-cost airline tickets. Ċ Despite the growing popularity of air travel, they still pose a huge budget for majority people. In some underdeveloped areas, it might take several years in saving before people can afford their first-time air tickets. Thus it is unrealistic for them to cheer for the achievement of airline development when it is so disconnected from their lives. It seems only the rich people who have bunch of leisure and spare cheques deserve the chance to enjoy the prosperity of airline. Ċ From my own perspective, it might be exaggerated if we praise the progress on airplane for benefiting majority people, but given the frequency at which people travel through airplane due to the globalization, the air travel will have significant impacts in our lives."
9387,Question:  International tourism has become cheaper and more countries are opening their doors to welcome more tourist. What are the benefits and the drawbacks? The advantages and disadvantages of tourism industry,"Today, tourism industry has become cheaper and trigger several countries to open their region for more tourism journeys. This issue possibly contains merits and demerits toward the country itself, which those will be elaborated more by this essay. Ċ Currently, majority of countries have computed certain sector, particularly tourism industry, which contributes significantly to national income. Moreover, a number of developed countries are prioritizing this industry as the core of their economy. It is happened because this industry can elevate public income by several ways. For example, it could potentially boost productivity of local handicrafts and resorts which are provided by local community. Therefore, they would possibly earn more income and enhance job opportunity directly, then these will contribute to national income indirectly. Ċ Turning to the drawbacks, the development of tourism industry sometimes causes negative impact, such as related to property ownership domination and local identity aspect. Firstly, this industry could perhaps become a threat to local citizen, if the industry is uncontrollable by enhancement of comers investment. Today, certain region well-known as tour place have been dominated by foreigner investment, such as coast area with its beautiful beach, highland area with its enjoyable landscape, or even farming field which is converted as an interesting resort. Thus, the property ownership will change over from local citizen to the investor. Secondly, this industry might possibly make the local identity worse. For example, traditional dance which just become an entertainment will reduce the sense correlated with its local wisdom. Ċ Based on elaboration above, the development of tourism industry which become cheaper today should be considered comprehensively to gain more benefits and reducing the drawbacks."
9388,"Topic: Males and females are different in many ways. Some jobs can be done by men, but other jobs are just suitable for women. Do you agree or disagree?","Overall, I disagree with the opinion expressed. Males and females do have many different characteristics in various aspects and behave differently in daily lives, but it doesn't mean that they have nothing in common in working environment. Ċ Normally, both men and women can acquire the same abilities required in any jobs if they are trained in the appropriate ways. That's why most of the people usually have one or more colleagues of opposite sex. Certainly, I won't deny that some jobs are likely more suitable for females such as nurse or kindergarten teacher, due to women are more patient and careful than men. But we have to admit that many men are working as same as women in these areas since they may have the same ability or contribute in other aspects, like to carry patients on the back in emergency, or bring more active atmosphere to children. Ċ Furthermore, with the rapid development of science and technology, the heavy physical jobs can be increasingly operated directly by modern machine, also majority of complicated logical calculation works can be handled by smart computing systems. While human are likely to pay more attention on monitoring and management in working environment in the future. So the physical and mental difference between males and females will affect much less on the assignment of jobs. Ċ In conclusion, many jobs can be done by both men and women, although some jobs are covered mostly by women, but doesn't mean men can not be involved, and vice versa."
9389,"In general, people are living longer now. Discuss the causes of this phenomenon. Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.","Studying the history of human beings shows that men always try to find some ways to live longer. Nowadays, this dream comes to truth. Healthier life, well educated people, and changing the style of life are the three important causes of living longer that will be elaborated in present essay. Ċ Medical improvements, which develop over hundreds of years, are the most significant causes of living longer. In the history, we have a lot of examples of public death just for common illnesses. In addition, immunity against diseases has such a striking effect that we can apparently see that the death rate of people because of epidemic illnesses decrease, drastically. Ċ Secondly, expanding of knowledge through whole society is another reason of living longer, in that well educated persons always prevent themselves from risky treatments. As a concrete case in point, during spreading of swine flu in my home country, statistics demonstrate that the numbers of patient from educated people is less than uneducated because of the fact that they read about the this vital illness and its preventing methods. Ċ Finally, changing the style of life is another reason for living longer. Modern people live in the safer place today than prehistoric one did. Furthermore, in the modern life convenient facilities such as computer, automobiles and automatic machines make our life easier. Therefore, dangerous tasks are carried out by machines instead of humans. Ċ To conclude, augmentation in the length of life is the final aim of human beings effort. They create various types of method for healthier life. They try to learn knowledge about living longer, and they improve the style of their life in the hope that they can live longer."
9390,"Some people believe in the traditional idea that the woman's place is in the home, while others say that idea is outdated and that women should play an increasingly important role in the workplace of the future. What is your opinion?","There have been strong arguments regarding women's place in the society in last decades. Some people advocate the opinion that women should stay home, and others who are against this theory, believe in women's significant roles in the future workplace. Ċ The first group who are mostly from traditional backgrounds, believe that males are the one who must work out in the society. For example, in most developing countries, children should be brought up by their mothers and this is the fundamental duty which females have and they must spend rest of their lives as a full-time housewife. However, for example, some countries like Saudi Arabia are wealthy and most of families have traveled around the globe and are familiar to modern cultures, their females do not have the right to drive, let alone having a job and work eight-hours a day with male colleagues. Ċ On the other hand, there are school of thoughts that are opposite the first group. They believe in women's potential as a part of the society which, not only they can participate in society as an employee, but also they can be more responsible in their positions than males. You can see this even in political roles, since Germany has elected Angela Merkel as a prime minister, they have turned to one of the most successful countries in economics in Europe. Ċ In conclusion, I extremely believe in women's powers and potentials in order to make the Earth a better place for living. It is quite clear that parents should encourage their daughters from early years to participate in communities which will lead them to their bright and successful future."
9391,"Studies show that crime rates are lower among those with educational degrees. Therefore, the best way to reduce the crime rate is to educate criminals while they are still in prison. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Researchers show that criminal activities are low when pupils have academic degrees. The effective way to reduce crime is to educate criminals while they are still in the prison house; however, in my opinion, educating people always do better in their personal and social lives.  Ċ To begin with, learning can change prisoners' minds positively and help them build up their careers when they can go outside. Consequently, if offenders can learn in jail, they may prepare themselves for future livelihood. For example, due to educational qualification, after prison, they would not go for offence, searching for a job and schooling can help them to find any other jobs; a jailbird does not need to commit crime again. Finally, every person may lead to a better lifestyle. When jailbirds do know how to earn money in a good way, then they could not have the interest in making any mischief.  Ċ On the other hand, in prison, education may favour connecting with society and achieving social value. Moreover, prisoners make themselves a good and honest nation when they have instructional knowledge. As a result, they do not involve offence, and positive outcomes happen in society. Hence, determining decreases and the public stay to continue a happier and safe life; remove panic against criminals, make them; lives sociable. Such as, community people always want to go outside when they have no fear, and it is common in most cities in today's world.  Ċ To conclude, the educational level diminishes misdeed from the prison when they are in jail. I feel that offenders need social value and personal strength, and only education can bring ideal results. For those who have educational degrees, the crime ratio is lower in the researcher's experiment. If the offence had gone from society, it would have the public blessed."
9392,"Q:Some people believe that mobile phones should be banned in public, especially on public transport, in restaurants and cinemas. Others think that mobile phones should be allowed to use anywhere. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Using mobile phones is more popular than before due to an age of information and changes of people's daily life. However, some people state that should not use phone in public; other believe that people can use phone in anywhere. My view is that mobile phones should be banned in special public places. Ċ People who believe phones can use in anyplace have their reasons. First of all, it is obvious that human have rights to do their favorable things which is not illegal. This means that using phone in anywhere is not illegal behavior that is the right of people. So, from the law angle, it is reasonable that mobile phones is allowed to used in public. Ċ In contrast, others believe that mobile phones should be banned using in public, specifically in library, hospital, and cinemas. This is because using phone in these special public is much ruder. If people speak loudly in these public, others will be affected by people who using phone. So, from the ethical angle, people should ban using phone is public. Ċ Personally I agree that people should not use phone in special public place, including library, restaurants and cinemas. For example, someone use phone in library and speak loudly, which will cause noise in a quite atmosphere of library leading to affect people who study in library. Although it does not break the law, it is bad manners in public. Ċ To sum up, people should use phone in correct occasions and should not use phone in special public places. Meanwhile, in terms of aspects of ethical, using phone in public is rude behaviors."
9393,"Question :  People these days watch TV, films and other programmes alone rather than with other people. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","These days, entertainment media offers its audience various ways for self-entertainment, one of which is watching the show in solitude. In my opinion, although this current trend provides unneglectable benefits, there are some other opportunities that will be missed out. Ċ One of the primary reasons that insular viewing habits appealing to certain people would be the essence of higher concentration and appreciation for the work of arts. There are certain shows that require utter attention from viewers to fully understand, absorb, and appreciate the artistry, metaphorical messages, and cinematography that the art producer intends to deliver. As a result, watching shows in solitude is considered as a way to indulge oneself in arts and savor the sense of arts while avoiding any unwanted attention, side distraction, and unwelcomed intrusion from external forces. Ċ Having said that, there are some other opportunities left missing out when enjoying the show without company. The most noteworthy one would be the absence of interaction and discussion between viewers about the show content, which can possibly make the experience unfulfilling and unsatisfying. Besides, the elements of sharing laughter and mutual feelings can establish and trigger positive connections between the viewers and the show; nevertheless, if watching alone, such perks will be missed out regrettably. Ċ In conclusion, although enjoying the work of arts alone allows individuals to fully absorb and appreciate the artistry, it ignores other opportunities and benefits of collectively sharing similar emotions and connections with other viewers. However, ultimately speaking, it depends on the personal preference of the viewer, and all forms of art appreciation should be respected and welcomed."
9394,"As computers translate quickly and accurately, learning foreign languages is a waste of time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Since the translation performed by computing systems is fast and is quite correct so, time consumed to imbibe a foreign language is wasted. I completely disagree with the aforementioned statement. The reasons behind the above disagreement will be discussed in the essay below with relevant examples. Ċ To begin with, though computers convert foreign languages quickly and without any errors, investing time to learn them is not a wastage as it helps individuals to learn a new method of communication. Adapting another completely different style of conversation aids people to groom themselves in a way which not only can convey their intent but also with an adequate tone and behaviour which is somehow not possible with only the assistance of any electronic translator. For example, one acquaintance of mine wished to say his client in french 'respond please' so, he politely requested the same in french on the call, however, when I translated the same words on my computing system even though, I got the wors to communicate but not the intonation and tone of them as they were mentioned by the device in a neutral manner. Ċ In addition to the above, It is true that all foreign linguals can be translated very fast and with precision by computers, nevertheless, learning them is still not waste of time as they facilitate an amicable interaction with the residents of the nation with which the language belongs to. It will be observed by you, if you visit any country abroad and the people you interact with perceive that you can understand and communicate with them in their mother-tongue, they get more drawn towards you and connect more easily. Moreover, they gesticulate warmly if you request them for any assistance or engage with them in a general discussion. For instance, one of my friends went to Germany , last year and he wanted some help to locate his hotel. He asked an unknown personality to guide him in german and the person was very benevolent to assist him in his quest of searching for his accommodation. Ċ In a nutshell, certainly, computers provide quick and precise translations of overseas linguals, although, putting in hours to learn them is not a wastage because they enhance our capability to deliver effective communication with emotions, furthermore, ensure an easy conversation with native individuals of the country that lingual belongs to."
9395,Topic:  Some people suggest that government should introduce some laws to control nutrition and food choices to ensure public health. Others say it's wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is sometimes claimed that controlling nutrition and food choices to ensure public health is wrong. Personally, I support this view although some people may hold a contracy opinion. Ċ On the one hand, it is reasonable for the government introduce some laws to control nutrition and food choices. The clearest advantage of this is ensuring the food eaten by people is always heathy. This help people avoid eating food containing too much sugar, carbonhydrates and cholesterol which have negative effects on heart diseases. Another benefit is that providing instructions about healthy diet for people, leading to enables people to have consistent eating habits. Many parents give their children too much choices of food but too little guidance in what should to eat. Ċ On the other hand, I believe that it is wrong for the government to control what people eat. Firstly, people have right to choose food which they want to eat. The government cannot force them to eat what they do not like. Secondly, this action may reduce the food choices of people. Each people have different eating habit so they always choose different food. Finally, this action causes deterioration in the food business development. This action do not allow to produce all the kinds of food which satisfy the demand of people, resulting in lossing many business chances. Ċ In conclusion, although controlling nutrition and food choices have some benefits, I firmly hold the view that people should be free to choose what they want to eat."
9396,"This is my Ielts essay, and do you think about it? Give me some advise. Topic: The new media has influenced people' s lives in modern life, Discuss both of the view advantages and disadvantage.","Whether such brand new generation of media as Internet has detrimentally involved in human's life or not has been under debate amongst concerning people in the evolution of communication. Personally, I concur that the proposition generates not only disadvantages but also against viewpoint. Ċ Evidently, information resources are extensive, owing to which it is impotent to dominate quality of these on Internet. Initially, users especially teenagers possibly approach with serious problems by clicking a website. Dangers from Internet presumably are virut or disclose privacy. Only by activating a unascertainable link, are virus undemanding to intrude upon computer systems. Indeed, the worst is possibly thieved private information. In addition, neither people nor information are in charge, hence, there are simple to proceed towards inapplicable website which has wretched infuence on them especially young people. Ċ Adversely, the modern media is efficient by dint of massive data and convenient using. Primarily, materials of Internet are large and free to search necessarily. To illustrate, televisions and magazines are obligate to defray cost to watch whilst the numbers of news are confined by broadcasting time and paper area. Additionally, providing essential and immediate information, Internet outweigh previous media in speed of updating tidings when users need by searching in Google or Yahoo. More importantly, the brand technology conveys extensive convenient thanks to economizing time and expense. Viewers plausibly search news in their home instead of either going to library or buying magazine. In modern life, computers are possibly replaced by further convenient means such as tablets. It is, therefore, appropriate to carry around. Ċ For all analyzed viewpoints above, I am prone to strengths that new media are more influential in modern media by viture of essential values. It is feasible to develop far more irrepective of limitation of disadvantages, if having software to stop virut or instruction to extend awareness of users."
9397,"With the increasing population and growing urban centers, many countries are losing their natural beauty places. What benefits are there to protecting places of natural beauty? How can this be solved?","For many countries, tourist attractions are mainly places of natural beauty and a plethora of leisure activities revolve around well-preserved natural resources. As the world’s population grows, a number of places of natural charm are destroyed to compensate for the need for more land for human usage; nevertheless, people should be reminded of how beneficial these natural resources are as well as should be educated on how to help save them. Ċ Case in point, rafting, one of the most popular tourism activities in Thailand, is a seasonal event that is only available with a significant level of water, a condition that requires the conservation of the surrounding natural resources. To further explain, most places of natural beauty feature abundant vegetation and trees, which not only are beautiful but also help purify the air. For instance, according to certain research, in one year, a mature tree can absorb over 48 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen in exchange. There are a few crucial benefits to protecting natural beauties: greenhouse gas reduction and tourist attractions. Ċ Secondly, one of the more prominent causes of the deterioration of natural beauties is tourism activities. Hence, ecotourism presents a feasible solution to protect both the tourism industry’s growth and natural beauty attractions. In order to allow us to harmoniously coexist with nature, there are a few approaches that we can take. For example, an average office worker probably consumes over 200 cups of coffee per year and, if we can replace these cups with reusable containers, it would be great as plastic and Styrofoam cups take ages to decompose, creating excessive wastes that are bad for nature. To put into perspective, incentives, including value-added tax exemption or discounts on lodging expenses, can be offered to tourists who choose to stay at local hotels or homestays that are pro-ecotourism. To illustrate, promoting ecotourism campaigns requires a collaboration of private sectors and government to create policies in parallel with marketing campaigns to encourage ecotourism. Firstly, when observing items used in our daily lives, it is obvious that we can switch from single-use plastic containers and packages to those made from reusable materials. Ċ To conclude, I am of an opinion that there are a number of advantages to preserving the elegance of nature and there are a few approaches, as mentioned above, that may effectively allow us to do so."
9398,The number of old people is increasing. Some think this will cause problems for countries while others believe old people still have value. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion,"Ageing is a natural process of life. While some people believe we should respect older ones and use their valuable experiences, others think they may impose a burden on society. Considering both points of view, I agree entirely with the first opinion, and we should be eternally grateful for having them around us. Ċ To begin with, some people argue that older adults have vast knowledge and experience which they obtain from all those years they have lived and worked. It is helpful for the youngster to solve issues that they face in daily life. In other words, elderly people are great mentors, and they can consider all the consequences of the problems; therefore, younger ones could gain the advantage of their precious advice. For instance, younger managers could help those who retired to reach their goals and maintain the success of organizations. Ċ On the other hand, those who disclaim that oldsters bring several problems to countries point out the cost of welfare programs imposing on society. Since retired individuals could not work, they use the revenue of pension funds. In the same way, it will push up their costs. Also, the government should take care of senior citizen's basic necessitates such as health care. This definitely places heavy financial pressure on administrations and may decline economic growth. For example, in the USA, a healthy couple retiring in 2019 will need close to $390,000 to cover healthcare expenses. Ċ To conclude, I agree entirely with the notion that older people should not be considered as trouble to countries. The pros of the elderly outweigh the cons; surely, Society must use older persons wide skills and wisdom to encounter the increasing obstacles in the present world."
9399,Some people consider thinking about and planning for the future to be a waste of time. They argue that people should live in the moment. Do you agree or disagree,"It is considered by many people that have thoughts about the future, and plans are the simple waste of time. Also, have an opinion that it will be better if people live only in the moment, not thinking about any things. I completely disagree with the idea that these are a waste of time, and people should live only by one moment. I believe that people should plan every moment of their life, which will help themselves in the future. Ċ Live only by one second it is not a good choice, because every minute has the ability to finish. I used to be such a person, I procrastinated a lot and did not see any positive effects from this. From this experience, I understood that this is only a phrase since most people are lazy to plan their day, or afraid of their future. For example, I am now in my senior year, most of my classmates do not know what major they will choose, or in what city and university they will study. Maybe it is normal, but their phrase"" I want to give everything from this moment, and time will come to choose"", got me angry. Anyway, I know that this is their time, but it seems to be people with this mind have a probability that will suffer from everything, and from hurry taking a decision. Ċ There are several reasons why people should plan their future. Firstly, by this citizens can save most of their time, and will not be surprised by consequences. For instance, if a person will write something that comes to their head at that moment, they can collect these ideas, as what they want to do in their future, it will not even take their time. Secondly, it gives confidence, that they are moving in the right way, and will not be frustrated by their future anymore. Finally, they can spend that time to do something than bigger planning their future, because every time is vital. Ċ In conclusion, my view is that people should save their time, it is the most important thing we have in our hands since we can not return our past, and it is better to plan everything than suffer from consequences of this."
9400,"Telling the truth at all times is not essential. On some occasions it is necessary to tell lies, and it is wrong to tell the truth. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In this day and age, where trust has become the most valuable commodity in the social interaction of a human being, there are polarizing views on whether giving a piece of factual information is not suitable on all occasions. Thus, sometimes, telling lies is unavoidable. I personally agree with the aforementioned statement, and in this essay, I will elaborate more on my point of view. Ċ To begin with, although many communities teach their youngster that telling the truth is always the right thing to do, there are some exceptional situations where people need to undermine this way of thinking. By this I mean, there are certain scenarios where white lies are acceptable, such as when there is a dangerous situation involved. For example, when one of our friends is hiding in the location that we are aware of due to running away from her violent husband, it is the right thing to answer with lies if the husband asking about his wife whereabout. That being so, in an appropriate condition, lies can save a person's life and that is considered a noble act. Ċ Moreover, a piece of lies can save us from an unnecessary condition where we can be involved in. It is not compulsory to give the truth if we know that this particular action will bring us more disadvantages in the future. For instance, if we do not want to be involved in a marriage problem of a friend, it is not obligatory for us to tell the fact that their spouse is having an affair, even if we know about it. Consequentially, small lies can save us from an unwanted condition which brings a downside to us. Ċ In conclusion, even though we were told to be truthful all the time as a noble act, sometimes telling lies is also beneficial, especially when it's involved to our safety and convenience. As such, I concur that on some occasions it is compulsory not only to avoid telling truth but also to give a wrong answer."
9401,It is more important for students to understand concepts and ideas than it is for them to learn fact exploring comprehension abilities,"Student life gives an opportunity to explore knowledge in various field. Some choose learning fact as their top priority, while others choose concepts and ideas are important to assimilate the information. In my opinion understanding the concepts and ideas are important than mere learning of facts. I feel this way for two important reason which I am going to explore in the following essay. Ċ First of all, students who comprehend the content tend to retain it for longer than who just follow the fact. For example I learnt how to give a comprehensive restorative care in my college. I use to follow all steps required adequately but sometimes I gave up on simple rule such as not using chlorhexidine after etching the tooth.thinking that it will not bring any difference. I later volunteered for a professor she explained why chlorhexidine is used post etching. Ectching releases matrixmetelloproteases which in turn reduces the bonding of restorative material to tooth. That is when I realized how significant those minor steps were. I never skipped the procedure after that. Ċ Secondly, If one try to understand the basic idea, he will have the ability to apply it practically more often.University life is to prepare student to face the real world, establish career to the at most. Learning facts to do well on exam and scoring higher grade will not bring him success. For example my friend in college knew all the formulas to solve physics problem but his idea to connect to real life situation lacked. He just studied to get the credential. As a result he was not able to hold sophisticated career . Ċ To conclude, I strongly believe that students should understand the concepts and ideas than just learning the fact. Concepts and ideas stay in our memory more than the facts learned just for the matter of studying and Knowledge of core concepts has better pratical application."
9402,Do you agree or disagree that progress is always good? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"Change is an inherent element of this world and development is one way to change. However, I disagree that unbiased progression is always pleasant. In this essay, I provide several reasons and examples of situations where moving forward is not always good. Ċ An advance in diseases is not welcomed. For example, in recent years the influenza virus has evolved and become more powerful. This progress means that more people are going to be infected. Therefore, healthcare systems should spend more budget on public health. As a result, instead of spending taxes on developing schools and education system, we have to put it on preventing a cold outbreak. Besides, such progression can also endanger elder population and infants lives too. Since their body defense system is either weak or not developed enough. Ċ Similarly, technological advances can also be unpleasant. Consider, for instance, the development of the Atomic bomb. This progress in science brought several casualties to human society. Not also it caused the death of millions of people in Japan, but also no one knows if it will be the cause of millions of death in the future. Another example of problems caused by this development in science is the incident happened in Chernobyl reactor. It supposed to bring inexpensive energy to the population but it only brought casualty and made the region uninhabitable. While people could use their old energy resources that nature presented to them. Ċ These examples of progress in human history convinced me to disagree with the statement that development is always good. Progress can burden taxpayers, endanger infant and senior citizens, and it might also stimulate loss of human's lives."
9403,"In many places today, rapid lifestyle changes are affecting family relationships. Do the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages?","It is often said that in most areas nowadays ,lifestyle is altering rapidly and these changes are impacting family interactions. From my point of view ,I believe this could have many benefits than downsides. Ċ Firstly ,one of the main drawbacks is remoting families from each other. For example one of the conspicuous changes in today modern world is living alone. It means the population of the world is merging into this model of lifestyle and they habitually decide to live without their family. This could create multiple negative influences on our lives such as the feeling of loneliness and conducting activities without helping. Therefore ,this makes it clear why shifting in human lifestyles could have harmful effects on their method of living. Ċ Secondly ,apart from disadvantages ,this could have many benefits. For instance ,when people accept this rule to live alone this could create an opportunity to become self_suffuciant and commence running our lives also ,conducting our operations. In most European countries these days we can see the advantages of this. This would probably be a positive advance for humans ,especially ,the young generations. Another upside would be for parents. When their children leave home this would be a suitable place to relax and conduct personal activities. We all know families always are engaging their childrens' work. As a result ,it becomes apparent there are many advantages behind each drawback of particular content. Ċ To summarise ,I personally believe shifting lifestyle has not numerous harmful effects on our family linkages. It is predicted that to continue increasing these kinds of changes in human lives we will become more independent in our daily lifestyles in the near future."
9404,In some parts of the world it is becoming popular to research the history of one's own family. Why might people want to do this? Is it a positive or negative development?,"Nowadays, people in some countries of the world, show a keen interest in studying their family history. This development has an overall positive impact. Some of the reasons why people do this research are discussed in this essay. Ċ Firstly, knowing one's family background is extremely important from the medical perspective, as there are certain diseases which run in families. For instance, the neurological disorders like Huntington's chorea and Friedrich's ataxia are hereditary diseases. If we know about our family history, we can easily avoid cousin marriages and protect our offsprings from these debilitating illnesses. Secondly, the research about one's family helps to clarify the reasons of conflicts between the family members. This provides an opportunity for the younger generation to avoid the mistakes made by their ancestors and live peacefully. Ċ There are many ways by which, knowing one's past, proves to be beneficial. First of all, when we get the idea of the diseases running in the families, we get a chance to stay away from family marriages and stop the transfer of those genes. For example, the transfer of blood disorders like Thalessemia could be stopped, if people avoid marrying their relatives known to carry the defected genes. Similarly, the positive traits of our grandparents and great grandparents could be adopted to lead a successful life, if we know our past. Such as, the way they enforced their children to stick together against all the odds, would serve as a light to enlighten our paths and help us teach our children to follow the same. Ċ To conclude, indulging into the research of our past could be a blessing for the families, because they can be saved from being handicapped and dependant on others. Moreover, one can learn from the horrible mistakes of our forefathers, that ended up in the break up of the families and could modify oneself and live at peace."
9405,"In order to study effectively, it requires comfort, peace and time. So it is impossible for a student to combine learning and employment at the same time because one distracts the other. Is it realistic to combine them at the same time? Support your opinion with examples.","Although such topics, in all likelihood, never will yield a consensual agreement. A constructive dialogue on - distractions such as employment may affect a person's learning process - can lead to thought-provoking discussions. My view is that irrespective of the numerous arguments that exist on either side, in this essay I'm explaining why I agree with the above statement. Ċ Employment is some sort of work committed to a company. This is because when the company is paying salary for the work assigned to him, and hence not possible to say an excuse. For example, a person has to work eight hours a day when he is employed. Therefore, the aforementioned discussion shows that the person will get only 16 hours in his learning and daily rest. Ċ Another pivotal aspect of the argument is that due to the employment work pressure it is not possible to concentrate on learning once person left his work for that day. Because an eight hour work can make him tired. For instance, once the eight hour work is completed, he needs to take rest for at least an eight hours within the next 16 hours to compensate his mental stress. This gives only the remaining eight hours for his studies, and it creates a very tight schedule between the work and sleep. Ċ In conclusion, this essay discussed the reason why only less than 8 hours is available for studies while a person is doing an employment. The equally potential evidence to support the arguments I have provided, underlines my opinion."
9406,"Many people believe that we have become a ‘disposable’ society, throwing things away rather than repairing them and reusing them. Why do you think that is? What are some of the possible problems this can cause?","Several individuals have a strong agreement that we have become a disposable society since we prefer to throw away things. There is one reason for this phenomenon and various consequences to this behaviour, which will be elaborated in this essay. Ċ In my opinion, the possible cause of this situation is the cheap price of the products, which is caused by the industrial revolution some years ago. Therefore, excessive industries, that have the ability to produce equipment massively, have appeared. Since this type of production generates one specification of a thing, it would make the price less expensive. For example, when ordering shirts in the market, customized clothes are usually more pricey than the normal ones. As the cost keeps getting lower, the communities are getting less afraid to buy new furniture. Ċ There are numerous hazards that can affect the globe as the impact of this habit, namely: the environmental destruction and the depletion of natural substances. The waste of materials may not degrade quickly as they contain toxic and hard compounds, such as plastic and metal. Moreover, they can pollute the water, soil, and air, provoking harmful diseases that can kill the animals. Furthermore, by manufacturing devices progressively, we might deplete the resources around the globe, as we know that global things are limited. Ċ In short, I think that the public's perspective is a factor that contributes to the decreasing rate of recycling old entities. In addition, we have to be aware of the future complications and troubles that can be the outcome."
9407,"Due to the change of women's role in modern society, men are now the ones suffering from sexual discrimination. Do u agree?","Women have always been mistreated and seen as inferior, when compared to men's physical strength and ways of thinking. But with the development of industry, the role of women in modern society has significantly changed after the First World War. However, I do not believe that men are now the ones who suffer from sexual discrimination. 56 Ċ To begin with, in Arabic countries the law is extremely strict when it comes to females' choices and rights. In the Orient, religion has always played a crucial role in people's life, determining their lifestyle and most of their character. Consequently, the law in Arabic countries was also influenced by Coran. For instance, women are forbidden to unravel their faces or their body parts by wearing short skirts or see-through blouses. What is more, in some conservative regions they have no right to study and they are kept home to cook and raise their children. 94 Ċ Despite women's emancipation, there will always be a shadow of doubt when hiring a female. A recent study carried out by the University of London revealed that 70% of the big companies are still more likely to accept a man, just because he is a man, rather than a more experienced and competent woman. This reliable research proves that people's way of thinking cannot be changed over night, diminishing women's chances of success in their careers. 75 Ċ These being considered, even if the women's role in modern society has changed, enabling/allowing them to study and work, it seems to me that men still have more benefits and freedom in both their social and professional life."
9408,Children learn by observing the behavior of adults and copying it. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is often said that the behaviour of adults has a remarkable impact on children. And they learn different groups of actions by merely observing. In my ,opinion I completely agree with the idea that observing behaviour is the key way to learn. Ċ Firstly, one of the conspicuous reasons for this argument is the performance of the human's brain. For ,example when children are observing aggression at home they habitually receive instruction from the nervous system to analyse this behaviour. This would create to register actions without any practice and repeat. Therefore this makes it clear that the adult's behaviours are always observed by children and they decide to conduct them. Ċ Secondly, another significant reason is the connection of children with adults ,especially families. It means that children regularly believe parents due to the fact that they have this taught that the family's manner always is in the right measure. For instance, the children under seven years old who spend most of the time at home with mother and father there is no denying that they are observing families conduct such as , habitat of consuming food, time of sleep and the conversation between them . Children listen to all of them and learn. This would probably help children to learn positive actions quickly. It becomes apparent children learn by observing different types of behaviours just by seeing. Ċ To summarise, I strongly believe that children are often under the influence of adults' demeanour. These could be positive and negative actions. It is predicted that the family's influence on children's behaviour is more than other observes."
9409,Some languages spoken by very few people are losing their importance and may become extinct completely. Is it a good or a bad development? What are the reasons for this?,"The extinction of language causes many lose of valuable feature, which makes harmful effects on people. Many parameters can lead this extinction. This essay is explained about irreversible effects and causes of this vanishing language. Ċ Vanishing languages can destroy some valuable information about societies. Language has many specific words which show some favorite sound and tune. These tunes can determine style of literature in many poems and stories. Therefore, extinction of language causes damaging the literature. For example, some traditional Iranian books are became usefulness, because many words become extinct. Also, language indicate geographic feature of places where these people live. Since some geographic feature may be changed very easily, by analysis some sound in language can realize this changes. Moreover, thought of specific people can be expressed by languages which have some words or slangs related to specific events and traditional believes which root of some people's behaviors. Ċ Extinction of language has many reasons. Language has close relationship with people's attitudes. If native people are affected from foreigners whose language affects the native language. In some condition, this native language will disappear. For example, tourists can affect native language of people in tourist spot areas. Moreover, technology increases the communication with people from different nationalities. The tendency to learn international language rises considerably. Young generation do not follow some traditional customs and languages. Ċ In conclusion, disappearing some languages causes losing some literature and knowledge about some geographical feature in several places. Traveling foreigners to different place in the around the world encourages native people to give up some languages and culture. Technology increase the tendency of learning English or other international languages."
9410,"part-time job for teenagers Topic:In some places, teenagers are encouraged to get part-time jobs while they are still in school. Do the advantages of teenagers working outweigh the disadvantages?","It is true that these days more part-time jobs are stimulated for adolescents to pick up while they are still in school in many places. Despite some obvious advantages of this issue, I would argue that these are outweighed by the disadvantages. Ċ On the one hand, there are two major benefits when teenagers take a part-time work. Firstly, starting to work at a young age prepares children more adequately for adult life. It teaches them how to react and behave in situations they would not encounter at home or at school. For example, many teenagers with a part-time job can easily adapt to life compare to the others. Secondly, children often have to work part-time to help their parents make end meet which also makes them appreciate the value of hard work and money. Ċ On the other hand, I believe that the drawbacks are more than such advantages. One reason for this view is that children could not possibly do a job with school duties and extracurricular activities. If teenagers have to work part-time, their study could not be totally concentrated which leads to a poor academic result later. Besides, having to work and go to school at the same time would greatly reduce the amount of time children can spend with their parents or their friends. Another reason is that adolescents are vulnerable and can be easily exploited by employers. In some developing countries, children do manual labour under terrible conditions that can be a severe problem to their health. Ċ In conclusion, it seems to me that the disadvantages of part-time job for teenagers are more significant the the advantages."
9411,Many people today buy ready-made food rather than spending time cooking. Ċ What do you think are the reasons for this? Ċ Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?,"Nowadays, the majority of people prefer having previously made meals more than the cooking process. In my opinion, the harmful effect of this food surpasses the benefits, and it seems that the problem is stemmed from several factors, that will discuss in the essay. Ċ Generally, flexibility is the key purpose of convenience foodstuff. In the first place, living a busy life, which means carrying the burden of life, may cause pressure on people to prioritize their daily tasks, leading to adopting ready-cooked meals. For instance, a working mother is entirely engaged with her work and taking care of her children. Moreover, this type of food become hugely popular, by being affordable to different kinds of people, because the suitable budget had, chiefly the lunch meal. Ċ On the other hand, withdrawal impacts could be possible on the consumer. However, the risk of health problems is run as those who are highly dependent on convenience food, not only because the lipid is loaded, but also containing harmful ingredients, namely preservatives. On contrary, even though a reasonable price had, but it will cause money strain, since a daily expenditure is needed for it, particularly for students and labourers. Ċ Interestingly, acceptance has gained for the ready-made meals. Identically, it is considered a crucial way to save time, as well as the exertion, had declined on cooking, allowing more activities to pursue. Equally, owning delicious taste, a variety of dishes had covered under that kind of processed foods. Like a traditional feast, that made people seek for that cuisine. Ċ In conclusion, the previously made diet has taken its popularity as a reason for the difficulties of life’s that people faced and is not expensive compared with the raw materials. Furthermore, time-consuming cooking could have economized. Conversely, such a product can cause many health issues and ends in financial distress."
9412,Nowadays a person has to be talented to become famous on the Internet. Discuss this view and give your opinion.,"Some of the features of the global revolution brought by the advent of the Internet are the creation of brand-new jobs and the easiness of becoming famous. I slightly disagree, though, with the idea that a person has to be incredibly talented to make a name for himself. Ċ A wide range of different characters and personalities can be easily observed surfing the various social networks. People are distinguished by the posts they share, that could be either serious or comics. Therefore, this brings to the existence of several categories of contents, such as ironical videos of carpool karaoke or charming artistic performances. This certainly gives a chance to everybody to become remarkable on the Internet. Moreover, each influence has a specific group of followers who are usually captivated by his ability to create interesting contents, even if he is not multi-talented. Ċ On the other hand, some people could argue that who wants to become famous has to excel in his chose field. Even if this could be undoubtedly an advantage over other people, however, in my opinion an aspiring artist also has to be able to use social networks and marketing properly. In fact, the creation of a connection with other users is fundamental, as it means gaining advertisement and consent, and thus increasing the amount of profit and followers as well. Ċ In conclusion, nowadays the reputation and the image of an artist is built via the Internet and thus via social networks, so people have to be focused on how to get a proper promotion on those platforms."
9413,"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task Ċ Write about following topic Ċ In many countries today, crime novels and TV Crime dramas are becoming more and more popular. Why do you think these books and TV shows are popular? What is your opinion of crime fiction and TV crime dramas? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience Ċ Write at least 250 words","It is surprising to see, out of all the available genres and topic, movies directed and books written on crimes are exceptionally popular among people in many geographies. The essay will first suggest the active involvement, that is demanded from the audience, being the primary reason for such a mind-blowing success and it will then state that this phenomenon is only going to increase in time to come. Ċ To begin with, the active involvement of the crowd has played a pivotal role in the wide acceptance of criminal centric novels and movies. It allows them to wear the thinking hat of the writer and director, for predicting the next plot. It not only gives them thrills when their projected scene actually happens but also chills when something unexpected event takes place. For instance, novels, movies and series written on Sherlock Holmes, a famous criminal detective of England, was widely appreciated by the global population. Ċ In my opinion, the fan following for crime fiction and TV dramas is going to stay, and grow exponentially in future. They help audiences in not being passive participants, but actively engage with the contents. Thus keeping their customers on the edge, they have the potential to increase their fandom and motivate publishers and directors to release more books and series related to the topic. For example, as per the recent study published by The Times, 90% of the shows recently released on Netflix and Amazon Prime belong to thriller and crime category. Ċ To conclude, it is an undisputed fact that many countries appreciate crime-related content irrespective of the mode of presentation. Active involvement of the public is the central reason for their unquestionable success. According to me, the following trend is only going to see an upward trend as confirmed by the wide release of serials on OTT platforms."
9414,"A lot of high schools nowadays offer their student’s career orientation by either giving certain universities chances for introduction and advertising or organizing field trips to a few universities. Some think students can benefit from these activities. Others reckon they are pseudo-effective. Which idea do you support? In about 350 words, write an essay on your ideas. Ċ Use examples and relevant ideas to support your opinion.","Nowadays, an increasing number of junior high schools foster their pupils' occupational orientation by either offering definite colleges opportunities for their public relations work or arranging short journeys to several tertiary institutions. Some believe undergraduates would take a lot out of these ventures; others, however, claim the contrary. From my perspective, I voice approval of the former, stating that students could reap huge benefits from participating in these activities. Ċ In the first place, it is undeniable that these programs are invaluable in supporting pupils with their job orientation, as this is a great opportunity for them to self-reflect. In other words, career counselling affairs help undergraduates realize their real aptitude and personal preference by offering advice and potential warnings, thus facilitating their making wise career choice. As an illustration, senior high school students aiming to become doctors are given chances by universities to get involved in some basic medical work in the local. This gives job orientation schemes a leading edge over others by exposing pupils to real-life circumstances. Ċ What is more, it is this venture that well functions as a motivating force for those who have already set their goals. That is to say, adolescents happen to gain insight into university life as well as their major fields by partaking in these career counselling activities, which could be a driving force to succeed in the college entrance exam. For example, such prestigious universities as Yale or Havard have long organized many university-sponsored events which involve academic field trips into the schools' main campuses, along with job guidance for high school pupils looking toward their future in these environments. Ċ All things considered, it is worth paying a visit to several tertiary institutions and receiving guidance from counselling agencies, since these could help senior high school students self-reflect and envision their future. Therefore, I am supportive of the aforementioned, believing that orientation affairs should be furthered and fostered to reach those really in need."
9415,"Some people believe that the good leaders are born, whereas others hold the opinions that the leadership qualities could be obtained during the life. Who represents the qualities indeed?","Leadership is one of the most important aspects influencing the future of organization or society. The quality of leadership is believed as a gift from god, but others claim that excellent leaders come from the experiences that they get throughout their life. Ċ For some reasons, the characters of people are caused by whatever they have faced no exception for leadership. However, the other factors that take a big role in the way to lead are talent (blood line) and culture. Talent is acknowledged as a primary reason someone can be a leader in which people who have talent since they were born are easily more capable handling their circumstances. As well as a talent, culture is one indicator expected to be a determination for the leaders. As an illustration, kingdom or country that has monarchy system believes that a leader must be the son of the king. Ċ On the other hand, the way people influence their surrounding depends on their background experiences and hard work. Someone who wants to get the top position in their organization must know everything and it will be gotten if they have knowledge from their experiences; more experiences are believed as the best teacher. Furthermore, hard work has the same proportion of experiences. For instance, the second President of the Republic of Indonesia, Soeharto, even though, he does not have the leader blood line, he is able to be a president because of his struggle. Ċ In conclusion, to sum up this essay I do believe that a brilliant leader needs extra efforts and experiences instead of the blood line leader, because with their abilities they will face and solve many problems surrounding them well."
9416,convenience foods emerging rapidly. The rise of convenience foods has helped people keep up with the speed of modern life style. What are the advantages and disadvantages? Do the advantges outweigh the disadvantages?,"There is an increasing number of people opting for convenience for in response to fast-paced modern lifestyle. This way, it makes a big change in companies and consumers alike. Although this phenomenon brings both advantages and disadvantages, the advantages absolutely outweigh the disadvantages. Ċ The two main advantages of this trend are offering opportunities for busy people and creating a novel industry for many corporations. First of all, business, who have to engross themselves in their work, stand a good chance to reduce the time for eating and prioritise their business. For example, most of the employees can only spend a few minutes for lunchtime, so convenience foods are reasonable options. Moreover, convenience foods emerging rapidly lead to the establishment of many companies. The demands for these foods are high, and many companies make a fortune with regard to this trend. For instance, convenience stores like Circle K and KFC become prevalent brands due to the increase of these foods. Ċ However, obesity and addiction to convenience foods are definitely alarming issues. It is undeniable that these foods contain unhealthy substances and lacking nutrients, which increase the rate of obese people. Furthermore, convenience foods deprive the ability of cooking from people. Needless to say, people are more dependent on these foods than the past, and at the same time the consuming of junk foods is going up. It can clearly be seen that young people in some countries are unable to cook meals for themselves, and hamburgers are widely chosen for breakfast. Nevertheless, if junk foods were consumed moderately, there would be no need to concern. Ċ In conclusion, although convenience foods leads to obesity and addiction, it has an extremely positive impact on busy people and market. I believe that its benefits definitely outweigh its drawbacks."
9417,Children in some parts of world have less responsibility compared to children in the past. Some people think this is a positive change. However others think of it as negative change. What is your opinion? Children have now more time for themselves - analysis of this phenomenon,"Child is a valuable asset in the future generation. Children development is more crucial for parents, but today children lack their responsibility while it compare with children in the past, However many people argue that it is a positive change. I personally believe that it negative change because it has many demerits either in school or in society. Ċ Taking less responsibility in school at the first, many schoolchildren today show less responsibility, For example, In my country Indonesia, many students left their house to go to school but in fact they went to game store and spent their time to play game and they forget their obligation to attend the class. As result, it is not good for their performance at school and make their reduced their grade in school,, from this evident, I believe that less responsibility on children make bad impact for their ability. Ċ Moving to demerit that appearing in society, Nowadays, Some Vandalism that happened in society that doing by children, it is more make society worried about. For example, many children compete to make gravity in the street wall, they make it without pay attention with the wall owner. Furthermore, If the owner found them, they would run out and opened their responsibility as crime agent. Ċ Taking into consideration, the changing of the children become lees responsibility is more damage because it has many disadvantages for either this children or people around them. I recommended that children should be taught the attitude to be more responsibility."
9418,Some people hold the view that a good teacher is more important for education success while others think the student’s attitude is more important to succeed in education. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Many individuals believe that an educator contributes significantly to being successful in learning, whereas opponents advocate that the attitude of learners is more crucial. This essay examines this question from both points of view and then states my perspective, being that the presence of lecturers is more important than schoolers' behaviour in class. Ċ To begin with, every student has different perspectives on each subject. Even though their likings differ, they can have a good grade from any classes with a healthy mindset. It is often said that a student who is positive toward a class have a higher chance to get a better grade than a classmate who has a negative attitude. The reason is that students who always look on the bright side are likely to overcome academic difficulties as they usually believe every effort will be paid. Also, those with a strong will to learn more, have a tendency to ask questions. This habit has a great influence on building up their knowledge and thus intellectual achievements. Ċ On the other hand, teachers play an important role in how much students can accomplish at school. This is because It is a schoolteacher’s duty to make schoolers focus on the lessons and help them with learning. Furthermore, an instructor who has an ability to treat students differently depending on their characteristics may affect school children's attitude towards studying, encouraging them to keep on their academic journey. For example, a person with introverted traits may feel difficult to ask a question or give a presentation in front of their peers. Such passive behaviour possibly hinders learners from obtaining and understanding new information. At this point, the assistance of the teacher is required so that the child can engage in the learning process. Ċ In conclusion, students’ mind and view toward learning is important when it comes to educational success, but it seems an educator with good skills affects more greatly and their role cannot be ignored."
9419,Art and music are considered some of the fundamental elements of all societies. Do you think art and music still have a place in today's modern world of technology? Ċ Should children spend more time learning art and music at school?,"Art and music have always been admired by many people in the entire world. This entertainment tool has been used worldwide as a form of relaxation, as well as a form of treatment for some health conditions. Some people may think that with the technology era that we are living nowadays, artists and musicians will have no place. However, I strongly agree that these two elements are essential in all societies, even for children that should be learning them at school. In this essay, the explanation for this idea will be provided. Ċ Firstly, art and music are considered important material for the remedy of some medical conditions. For example, the elderly suffering from dementia has shown a significant improvement in cognition skills after being exposed to musical therapy. In addition, people presenting severe anxiety and depression have also shown better response to their therapy after using this type of therapy. Because listening to songs stimulate the brain to produce substances like endorphin, these psychiatric diseases tend to be less severe when this treatment is implemented. So, these elements are key to improve the treatment results on this population. Ċ Secondly, it is already known by studies that have been done, that children who are exposed to melody lessons have a better outcome in the future. For instance, kids that learned to play an instrument developed different skills, like cognitive, concentration and critical thinking, faster than kids who didn't have this experience. Furthermore, musical healing has been shown to be an excellent tool for relaxation in children with diseases like anxiety and hyperactivity disorder. Ċ In conclusion, in my opinion, art and melody will always have a place in people's lives, as well as for those with health issues. And modern technology can even help to disseminate this thought, by facilitating the access to these tools. So, parents, caregivers and healthcare providers should engage the society to listen and admire these two elements."
9420,"In the 20th century, contact between many different parts of the world has developed rapidly through air travel and telecommunications. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","Undoubtedly, advanced technology has managed to allow humans to have better relationships all around the world as compared to the past. And it has happened due to breakthroughs in the means of transportation and communications. I believe the advantages of this far more outweigh the drawbacks that it has and the reasons for my opinion are discussed further. Ċ There are several advantages of this development. The most prominent one is that now people can connect to any part of the world because of the latest telecommunication systems. For example, one can reach a greater audience using the internet and computers. This has helped many businessmen in their reach to customers all around the globe. In addition to that, the tourism industry has been benefitted tremendously due to better air travel. In other words, many unknown tourist destinations have become popular in the last decade as now improved aviation systems can connect distant places. Ċ However, there are also a few setbacks to these transformations. Firstly, the rise in pollution is one of the major drawbacks of the increase in the number of flights. For instance, air pollution has risen by 20% in the last 10years due to an increase in air transportation. Furthermore, due to redefined telecommunication, the integration of the culture and tradition has taken place, which has led to the loss of the cultural identity of the nations. Like, people follow traditions of other nations that trigger social imbalance. Ċ In conclusion, although there are minor drawbacks of these innovations which can be dealt with, with precautionary actions, in my opinion, advantages are way more pivotal for the world and must be supported."
9421,"Some people are happy to stay in the same area for their whole life, while others prefer living in many different places. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Nowadays ,it is argued that some people are joyful to live in the same place for their entire life whereas , other opponents want to live in many different places if they have a chance . In this essay , I will explain more detail on both views in the following paragraphs and then I will present my own opinion. Ċ On the one hand , some people want to stay in their native place as long as they can . They do not need to learn new things in a new environment and, also do not require to leave their childhood friends and relatives . In addition , some families are building their businesses generation by generation.So , it would be difficult for them to start their lives in strange locations again .For example , some Japanese and Chinese families believe that inheriting the family business is their duty and responsibility. As a result , they can maintain their own culture and customs as long as they want . Ċ On the other hand , other people believe that staying in many different locations can get many benefits like a multi-cultural environment and some good opportunities . Obviously , people have to capture and practise new things like languages and food if they are moving to a new location . Undoubtedly , they may have more new challenges and problems in their new place like following the local's traditions .For instance , the region where restricting to wear specific clothes only can suffer the person who loves to wear whatever he or she wants. Ċ To conclude , whether people are living in their origin or different locations , they should contribute their experiences and knowledge to the particular society where they are living . In my opinion , it does not matter where we are living but we need to be useful people for our communities ."
9422,You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Write about the following topic. Ċ Some say that it would be better if the majority of employees worked from home instead of travelling to a workplace every day. Ċ Do you think the advantages of working from home outweigh the disadvantages? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 250 words.,"Some individuals commented that if workers do their activities from their households it could be better rather than commuting daily. Personally, I believe the boons outweigh the drawbacks since they could be more efficient at work. Although it sometimes could lead to distraction and failure to accomplish goals. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments. Ċ On the one hand, teleworking brings effective results. In other words, this sort of work makes employees produce more than expected. For instance, the new research carried out by the University of Oxford showcased that 60% of full employed workers who performed their tasks from their residences were 10 times more efficient than those in the enterprise facilities. As a result, the managers were fascinated by the high performance of their employees. Moreover, it is the most appreciated form of work in the privileged nations. Ċ On the other hand, online working leads to unaccomplished missions. Because of the distraction from relatives, especial Boys and Girls, a plethora of employees tend to fail deadlines. For example, 30% of the home-workers were delayed to deliver their tasks on time last years in two big enterprises in the UK, Hence, a significant number of them were fired. Furthermore, it is seen as the most prominent reason for workers to be out of a job in the future. Ċ In conclusion, notwithstanding the pitfalls, the development could result in, it is the way out to follow owing to the fact that it brings more advantages than downsides. Therefore I still believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. I would go as far as to say, the enterprises' owners could take seriously this measure."
9423,Some people think that older employees contribute most to the success of a company. Others think that younger people play a more vital role. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"In almost every organizations, human resources are the combination of both older and young workers. Although it is believed by some public that the achievement of a firm mostly depends on the assistance of experienced folks, other people assert that young team are the prime contributor to the accomplishment of a firm. This essay will discuss why younger generations are more effective than older employee despite their vital contributor. Ċ To begin with, old workers often prove themselves as the crucial part of an organization’s achievement. Since senior employees have profound knowledge and long expertise to accomplish any task in an organization, they are frequently considered as the guardians of a firm. For instance, even though the majority of the working-class public of Japan are aged, they have reached the stage of a developed country. Thus, the older force can make a significant impact to acquire the desired goal of any industry. Ċ On the other hand, despite the few benefits of having older personnel, fresh and young blood is nowadays considered the key players of achievement of a company. The young workers have more updated knowledge and competencies regarding the new challenges of the business world. Moreover, as they are physically fitter, agile, and energetic compared to the older force, they can lead the organization to find the way of gaining its goal. For example, presently, the founders of many successful business institutes, including Facebook, belong to a comparatively younger workforce. Therefore, young employees are proven to be more capable of achieving the success of businesses. Ċ In conclusion, the essay argued why younger generations are more capable to acquire goals and objectives than the elderly manpower. In my opinion, I think younger workforce are the pivotal contributor to the success of a company."
9424,Harmful Effects of Junk Food Junk food is damaged to health. Some people think education is a solution while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The excessive consumption of junk food has been the subject of debate. Some people argue that raising awareness of fast food's detrimental effects is a viable solution. Others claim that this opinion is of no value. In this essay, each viewpoints will be discussed and critically evaluated before a final conclusion is drawn. Ċ Firstly, with the advent of mass media, the dissemination of drawbacks of overeating junk food can be ubiquitous and prevalent. People can also have easily access to the information through the orientation programmes by schools and community. Because of that, education is useful and transformative with profound impacts on human behavior. By developing health consciousness, people can enrich their knowledge about the harmful effects of packaged food. Once they are fully aware, they will inspire to take actions. They prioritize the nutritious and healthy meals by consuming food which is rich in vitamins. Therefore, fast food consumption is in decline. Ċ However, opponents argue that education fails to produce a desirable outcome for following reasons. To begin with, in modern society, people tend to be pressed for time as a result of stresses and strains at work. Thus, proper home-cooked meals are impossible, instead, convenience food is an alternative choice for people to eat at the workforce. Moreover, people's decision is another contributing factor. For some people, unhealthy food seems appealing to them although they know this food is at the expense of physical fitness. Because consuming packaged food excessively is a deeply-ingrained habit, endeavors to change may be of no use. Besides, action is a slow process so during the procedure of healthy habit, many people decide to give up and the desire to change is resistant. Ċ In conclusion, junk food is in the detriment of people's health. In my opinion, I strongly with the latter one and some proactive measures should be taken to tackle the problem."
9425,"These days people pay more attention to artists (writers, painters, and so on) and give less importance to science and technology. To what extent do u agree or disagree?","People start following artists like writers, painters or actors because are popular. Although sciences and technologies were able to reach important milestones over the last two decades. Likewise, they have famous people. I disagree that science and technologies are treated as less important. Ċ The increase in popularity related to artists is associated with several reasons. Prestigious academics recognized the talent and effort that artists have. For example, Academic awards like Oscar hosts every year in the United Stat and have an enormous audience around the world. Another reason would be the salary. Talented people deserve earn a good salary this is depend on their popularity and talent. A good actor can make a lot of money just for only one movie. In this regard, people decide to become an actor in order to earn well-paid salary. Finally, most artists gain quick popularity across the globe. A movie can be seen in many countries and actors are become celebrities. Therefore, for the all reasons mentioned above people draw their attention to artists. Ċ On the other hand, science and technologies have reached several milestones because skilled people have developed a variety of inventions. The inventions of the first system operation like Windows if Bill Gates had not spent his live in developing such technology, many people would not have computers. In addition, the inventions of internet, these days this technology has influenced in the way people living. Therefore, many people have also want to do something and put their attention towards technology develop. In terms of science, the healthcare is also growing faster in developing medicines that can cure common diseases. People are aware of the advancements of healthcare and start investigating and doing something about it. Ċ In conclusion. I disagree that science and technology have less popularity and importance. Despite their remarkable achievements, people are still draw their attention towards science and technology"
9426,"It is now possible to perform everyday tasks, such as bank transaction, shopping or even office works, without meeting people face to face. What are the effects it may have on individuals and the society as a whole?","Today, performing daily duties such as bank transaction, shopping or office works without meeting people directly is feasible. This is due to the advancement of technology has changed the way of people to interact each other. However, there are some effects on individuals and the whole of society owing to this change. Ċ Lack interaction among people leads society to be more individualist. They relish spending their time solely and more communicating with people they need to talk with via internet as opposed to speaking face to face, in which taking much money and energy to meet them in the long distance. Furthermore, they suppose by using the cutting-edge of technology, it is not longer need other people to help their daily tasks, because they believe can do it by their self. Hence, it is undeniable that the society becomes more anti social. Ċ In addition, people become dependence on using the internet. Everyday, they spend a lot of their time in the screen rather than getting around. In the house for instance, the relation among family member, either between husband and wife or among parents and children becomes less. The harmonization within family is flat and lack affection, due to people prefers spending their daily pursuits with their gadget. Thus, using technology abounds should be taken into account. Ċ In conclusion, it is true that the advancement of technology has helped society in performing their daily tasks. However, people should limit their self to use it, considering the possibility effects that might occur."
9427,"Some people believe that criminals should be put into prison as long as possible. However, others believe that it is necessary to educate those people in local community. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.","People tend to have different views about how criminals should be dealt with. While keeping lawbreakers in prisons for a long time can uphold an ordered society, I believe giving them another chance to learn how to be good citizens would bring more advantages to the local community. Ċ On the one hand, I think it is possible to deter people from breaking laws by directly sending criminals into lockups, as prison life probably means bringing some convicts the constant threat of violence. However, strict jail terms may also harden a convict against society as a result of brutalising treatment he or she receives, especially when prisoners stay in jails for too long. This could not prevent their future crimes. For example, if teenagers are abetted to commit crimes and are put into prisons for years, they would probably be repeat offenders, because they see so much cruel behaviour in jails and do not what is right and wrong. Ċ On the other hand, education has always been an effective means of crime prevention. For one thing, some people commit crimes because of the lack of knowledge rather than breaking laws deliberately. They need to have a chance to learn basic knowledge. For another, those at the bottom of society are likely to be tempted into a life of crime as a solution to their problems. If they can receive appropriate courses in their local community, they might learn skills that can help them live a normal life. For instance, if a pickpocket learns how to drive and have a driver licence, he or she can find a proper job and then get out of the past life. Ċ In conclusion, I understand why some people want lawbreakers to be sent to prisons as long as possible, but it seems to me that it is more practical to provide proper education for criminals to curb lawless behaviour."
9428,"Some people say that the bicycles are a good, modern means of transportation. Other say riding a bicycle has clear disadvantages. Ċ Discuss both view points and give your own opinion.","Many individuals these days prefer to ride a bicycle, while others claim it has certain drawbacks. In my opinion, bicycles are beneficial for both environment and human beings. Ċ On one hand, critics of this argument state that bikes are more time-consuming. In other words, nowadays, people are very busy in their lives and want to reach their destination as soon as possible. For such people, using bicycles for transportation is simply a waste of time. Since compared to other means of transport like cars, motorbikes and trains bicycles do not serve the purpose. For instance, a person working in an office where strict timing is followed, cycling will not help. Ċ On the other hand, however,the disadvantages mentioned may not outweigh the advantages of being useful for nature and humans. To elaborate, cycles are environment friendly as neither they burn any fossil fuels and pollute the air nor, they make noise-causing disturbances. Human beings can benefit from cycling, it can be proved by an example, studies conducted on the health of cyclists and non-cyclists showed that people who ride a bicycle regularly, have fewer chances for heart failures and obesity compared to others. These are the common health problems faced by people these days. Therefore, it can be prevented by riding a bicycle. Ċ To conclude, even though bicycles may be a bit late but choosing them to travel will help keep the earth pollution free and ensure our better health conditions. Thus, in my perspective cycles should be a mode of transportation of the future."
9429,Some people think that excessive use of mobile phones and computers badly affects teenagers' writing and reading skills. Do you agree or disagree with the statement? Give your opinion.,"I disagree that using mobiles and computers can decrease writing and reading skills among young generation. Some people believe that applying mobiles has bad effects on some literature skills children. Nevertheless, others think that some portable electrical gadgets such as mobiles increase to access some written materials. Both situation will explain in this essay. Ċ To begin with, using some electrical gadgets gives a chance to children to write many writing. Young generation can connect to the internet and download many documents and read in different situations including in the street, on the cars and in the cafe. Teenagers are very keen to communicate with peers, so they send huge messages and write many texts during day. Ċ Some software programs installed on mobiles and computers encourage adolescence to post some writing materials. They try to read many other interesting documents and written pages to find some sentences to attract others. For example, Instagram has many pages in which there are a lot nice sentences and written materials for different people to show themselves. Ċ On the other hand, teenagers spend more time to watch visual programs rather than written programs. Young adults watch different films and listen to various music by cell phones. Therefore, they do not have enough time to study their lessons and involve to other books such as novels, poems and math books. Also, when children send messages or write sentences, they try to omit some words and mix some numbers and words to each other to have fast communication. Since they do not use literature very correctly, children lose some grammars and reduce their domain words. Ċ In conclusion, emerging new electrical gadgets rise the chance people to access hard materials such as written documents on the net. Also, some programs encourage teenagers to read many posts for others because of knowing about others' ideas."
9430,Some people say that too much attention and too many resources are given in the protection of wild animals and birds. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Every living thing on this planet plays a significant part in balancing the ecosystem. Although a set of persons believe that it is unessential to think for this wildlife and worry for their natural habitats, I don't advocate this illogical notion. My standpoint is justified in the following paragraphs. Ċ First and foremost, carnivores and birds play a huge part in continuing the food chain. The reason being even if a single animal goes extinct, the whole lineage gets affected. For example, due to growing urbanization, the deforestation rate is increasing. And thus impacting the lives of the animals. The wildlife is constantly interrupted by the cruel humans by seizing their land, hunting wildlife and removing their body parts. In addition, since the innocent lives don't get proper food, they barge into the human territory which results in the danger of people's lives. Hence, proper planning of the forests and national parks is inevitably required for peaceful living conditions of global biodiversity. Ċ On the other hand, if we overlook the necessities of the aerials and amphibian species, nature will revert to humans in a hazardous way. For instance, in today's scenario the number the national parks are reducing, the animals are dying, the lakes are drying, the ice-cover cap is reducing. This all can be prevented if we enhance and look upon the existence of wildlife and their homes as an essential part of the planning. Ċ To summarise, it is undeniable that the animals and birds need appropriate dwellings and proper resources for continuing their life cycle. If this ongoing imbalance rate increases , there will be existential crises and the human will have to go through dangerous repercussions."
9431,"While it is sometimes thought that prison is the best place for criminals, others believe that there are better ways to deal with them. What is your opinion?","There is no doubt that to save the general public from offenders is to keep them in prison. However, some people agree and others argue that approach some other ways. In my opinion, lockup is specifically designed for criminals. Ċ To begin with, some people agree to keep the criminals in prison because there they will be kept under the authority of the police department. In this way, there will be no chance to run away. Moreover, some gangsters are highly professionals. For instance, the robber, they are extensively expert to their occupation and have weapons too. They can do robbery of any house, banks and other places. They can also harm the individual life if they fail to prescribed plan. Therefore, to keep the criminals in jail is public safety. Ċ On the other hand, some people argue that other ways are better to deal with them. For example, if lawbreakers are kept in the closed Room in a house in the middle of the city where the general public live. This means we are giving them a chance to run away and do start their work again and harm individual life. Because they have weapons. Everyone loves their life and family. Therefore, a good decision is a lockup for all the offenders. Ċ To conclude, criminals are the masterminds and the General Public is innocent. In order to save the life of civilization keep the gangsters in the prison under the authority of police where even they cannot think of any crime."
9432,"the Global Ignorance People have little understanding of the importance of the natural world. What are the reasons for this, and how can people learn more about the natural world?","Given the fact that how vital the natural surroundings is of public ignorance. This can stem from many causes, which calls for possible solutions to be adopted. Ċ There are several rationales in charge of this unawareness, the most significant of which are environmental degradation and side effects of advanced technology. As for the former, nature deterioration precludes people from getting exposed to the natural world in these days. Such factors related to pollution as excessive use of non- biodegradable materials and natural resources exploitation have been eradicating numerous tracts of forests and wildernesses, which leads to the constraint of having insight into biodiversity as well as the fear of health-related problems deprived of many forms of contamination among citizens. Moreover, another cause could be the adverse consequences of modern technology. Indeed, sedentary lifestyle and obsession with social network resulting in the misuse of technology discourage human from unfolding even the most fundamental aspects of their nearby environment. As a result, not only will people lose interest in exploring the outside world but they will also disregard the considerable part of the natural environment. Ċ There are several measures which can be taken to solve this issue. To begin with, the government can impose in earnest stringent laws and environmental - alleviating policies to combat pollution and habitat devastation. This can be done by heavily punishing individuals and organizations that discharge raw sewage and unprocessed pollutants into nature, carried out jointly with rejuvenating stretches of forest. Another solution could be for people themselves to wisely make use of contemporary technology. This encourages human to play an active role in suitably allocating the amount of time gluing to the high-tech devices and having general knowledge about nature the world over. Ċ In conclusion, neglecting the vitality of ecology results from many causes, and there are several actions that can be taken to address this issue."
9433,"Nowadays, an increasing number of people like to move away from their friends and families. Does the trend outweigh the disadvantages?","Every human being ought to shift away from his birthplace and settle down for suitable employment. Nowadays, many society residents are leaving their hometown and settling in other cities for various reasons and in comparison, considering the economic benefits of this move and the pain of moving away from loved ones, the upcoming article will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of relocating homes before my final decision. Ċ On the one hand, citizens living in small towns, especially the younger generation, are more likely to move to a place other than their hometown. In other words, after completing their education, young people go to the big cities to look for a career, and after getting a good job they decide to stay in that city. For instance, young people, after being educated in small districts and areas of India, go to metropolitan areas like Mumbai or Bengaluru for a relevant job based on their education. As a result, forgetting their place of origin and settling in such a big city looks like a wise thing to do. Hence, no other choice remains for people other than to move to the big capitals for good and desirable work and career development. Ċ On the other hand, despite the advantages of being outdoors, there are some disadvantages out there. For example, children who, despite having much support from their parents, step away from home and family for a better future, which results in them losing their adults. They miss their elders and acquaintances so much that they sometimes have to deal with stress. Thus, it is imperative to have a family in good and as well as bad times. Ċ To conclude, having discussed the topic at length, I surmise that the advantages and disadvantages of relocation have different predominance. Although professionalism is fundamental in life, on the contrary, it is equally important to have family and friends; Therefore, every human being needs to develop some strategy, which would be most effective to take the family with him alongside the metropolitan city that provides the same employment."
9434,"going to a real school or study online Some people think distance learning has more benefits than schools, so schools will disappear from our lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?","Nowadays, with the development of technology, distance learning has become another option for students to acquire knowledge. Effective as it may be, debates of it have yield a spectrum of views. Some claim that learning online is a good choice and one day might replace schools whereas others assert that schools still have its irreplaceable status. My stance is more in line with latter based on following reasons. Ċ First and foremost, the major rationale for going to school is that students could learn how to participate in a group. Often in the family, parents tend to spoil their children, so it is crucial for students to develop an appropriate relationship with their classmates in schools which includes to learn to share food or empathize others. Therefore, they can engage well in society in the future. Also, knowing how to express their ideas in front of the public is also an important value in schools since from teachers' and friends' reaction, children can tell if it is a successful performance or not. Ċ Furthermore, not only can youngsters gain the knowledge of main subjects at schools, they also have other additional classes such as art and music which are essential for students to find their own talent. Most of online courses still focus on cultivating teenagers' academic ability like literacy, but music, art and sports are also very important subjects, too. They can rather train students' left brain and provide alternative way to let off stream. Also, some people are only talented at playing piano and painting, and schools offer a good place to look for their aptitude and seek different possibility. Ċ In a nutshell, although studying online is quite efficient and convenient, given the function of schools to develop communication skills and other talents, I am convinced that school education would not be taken over."
9435,"“Children all over the world should learn to speak a single, universal language fluently in addition to their native language.” Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays knowledge of foreign languages is important for everybody. But what about children? It is considered by some people that the ability to speak another, the universal language is necessary for them. However, there are also individuals, who disagree with the statement. In my opinion, children, who can talk with the community in a non-native dialect have more opportunities and for this , the reason I think universal vocabulary should be learnt by them. Ċ Firstly, from a young ,the aged population must be learnt how to speak, how to communicate with people from other countries. For reaching it they should study a non-native language, which is understood by the majority because this skill will help them in different life situations. For example, my elder brother, when he was a kid, was lost in the mountains. Thanks to my mom, who taught him English, he found the way to the village, where we waited for him. Thus, it is worth making your child learn languages. Ċ Secondly, the capacity to speak the universal language well beneficial not only at a young age but also at an old one, because multilingualism nowadays is in demand in the labour market. It will open career prospects in the future and the best time to get such a skill is childhood because it is known that people at a young age learn new things much faster than old ones. For instance, my brother’s friend can speak English and German, because when he was I child he had had a babysitter, who taught him them. Consequently, by the age of ,10 he could speak freely with native speakers. Moreover, he was hired because of this ability. Hence, the contribution to the child in the present will give positive results in the future Ċ In conclusion, I would like to say that children should have the skill to speak fluently in the universal terminology because it is advantageous not only in the present whereas also in the future."
9436,"investment on public transport Some people think governments should spend money on faster means of public transport. However, others think money should be spent on other priorities (e.g cost, environment...) Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is thought that governmental budget should be allocated on faster means of public transport, while others advocate to different priorities such as its price and environmental effects deserve to be financed rather than its speed. From my perspective, there are other elements should be concerned rather than the fastening the speed of public vehicles. Ċ On the one hand, quicken the speed of public transport supports the general population to save their commuting time. In fact, most people now tend to opt for subway train and bus services to go to work. They will be in an adequate health status to start working if it were not for struggling on road with congestion. However, the high speed is not in accordance with some people whose physical health can not adapt to it. For example, the local community sometimes may find taking metro dizzy or sick due to its speed at great height. Ċ On the other hand, a great number of opponents of fastening the transportation argue that other urgent problems, namely, cost and environment, should be financially invested. If public transports achieve widespread acceptance, the price is believed to decrease to facilitate all people to utilize. In addition, the cut down on petrol and parking expenses will save not only a large amount of money for users but also preserve environment. Thanks to the usage of communal vehicles, there will be a significantly drop in the emission of carbon footprint. Ċ In conclusion, people are overall beneficial from the governmental investment on public transport. Nevertheless, I believe that money spent on other priorities such as cost and environment is better than fastening its speed."
9437,"Some people find it difficult to present a speech/presentation in the public. Therefore, it is suggested that public speaking should be taught in schools. Do you think it is important to know how to speak well? Ċ Do you agree or disagree with this view?","In the recent times, it has been discovered that people have some difficulties when giving a talk/presentation to the general public. As a result, there is a suggestion that public speaking skills be taught in citadel of learning. I opine that it is necessary for people to be able to speak fluently, and I also agree with the notion that it should be taught in schools. Ċ To start with, knowing how to speak freely, has numerous advantages. One importance of being able to speak fluently is that it helps to build confidence. When confidence is in what one does, the individual will be able to withstand any form of challenges faced with in life. This also brings fulfilment in one's endeavours and achievements are sometimes enormous. For instance, my brother, who speaks fluently, was able to pull through oppositions in his workplace, and he is now standing tall in the company. He was also promoted because the management saw this virtue in him, and they were convinced about his ability to move higher. Ċ I totally agree that this skill be taught in schools because whatever is learnt in schools stays longer with us. This could be due to the fact that the techniques used to imbibe things in schools are fundamental and intensive at the same time, hence, then lessons are well understood. To illustrate, things like etiquette that I learned in the primary school has not departed from me. As a matter of fact, people testify to the high level of decency I display today. Therefore, if public speaking is taught in schools, people will do well while addressing the public in future. Ċ To conclude, ability to speak fluently is an indispensable virtue that births confidence and I agree that it should be taught in schools because that is where knowledge is well impacted."
9438,Young people say that travelling to different countries benefits them and the society. Do you agree or disagree. Give your opinion.,"It is believed by young individuals that exploring different nations in the world is beneficial for themselves and society as well. I agree with this statement partially, as knowing various cultures benefit a person individually but I do not think it is advantageous to society in any way. Ċ To begin with, people get to learn about the ways of life in different places and they realise how unique every country is in its own right, which I believe is crucial for a person to grow mentally. A person's mindset broadens a great deal when he gets to see various human societies. Moreover, it is an amazing way to release stress as well because while travelling one gets a break from the routine life and most people who take regular breaks to go to other countries, for instance, are found to have a healthier mind than those who do not. So clearly, travelling aids in developing different perspectives and having a time off from everyday life. Ċ Though there are some advantages of travelling to the individuals, I do not think on a societal level there are any benefits since many people exploring the ethnicities of other nations tend to respect their own traditions and history less. It is human to compare what one has with what others have, and humans always find what others have more alluring. So, in many cases what happens is, a country loses its culture completely. Canada, for example, does not have anyone culture of its own, it has multiple cultures and this is happening with most countries of the world. Hence, societies of different countries are suffering from the loss of cultural identity. Ċ In conclusion, there are quite a few advantages of going to other countries on a personal level but societies of nations are not benefited at all in my opinion."
9439,Some people say that children should stay in school until the age of 18. Others suggest that educating children until the age of 14 is enough. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Infants need lessons in school while they are 18 years old. However, educating to Change prepositionapplyIt seems that preposition use may be incorrect here. Ċ show exampleschildren up to the age of 14 is all right. There are both advantages and disadvantages of this argument. From my perspective, toddlers who are 18 years old still require institution wisdom. Ċ To begin with, there is no alternative way of acquiring lessons. Human needs education. Man cannot grab anything if there is no system of providing books. Learning anything can form a person to take the challenge against any hazardous situations. As a result, if a human still stays in school or college he can learn properly. Thus, he can implement anything in the right way which leads him to the top of the position of any Institute. For instance, 18 years old guy become mature and he can imply any kind of tasks where he can face any challenging tasks which are done by adults. Ċ On the other hand, man needs practical lessons parallelly. It will be a binding issue for them if they acquire only one-sided learning. As a consequence, the guys who are 14 in age need that type of knowledge which is not frozen only in their institutional learning. People who are adolescents need a sharp hand of visualization where they can mould themselves. In this way, he can prepare himself which can give him a lot of confidence. For example, 14 years people are able to grab any practical proficiency and it is possible that time when he finishes his studies at the age of 15. Ċ In conclusion, persons require education while they are in 18 years. Nevertheless, It is also necessary to take practical knowledge while they surpass their 13 years of age. I am on opinion, 18 years old is the suitable to take school lesson so that it can be flexible for them to do the next step of the work."
9440,Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home. Why do you think it happens? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such choice?,"In today’s modern world prepared meal is chosen by the majority of people and they would rather not to cook at home. In my opinion, it occurs because of our busy way of life. Ordering a ready-made meal may reduce the term to prepare feed for ourselves. However, this type of repast may not be nutritious and it can be fast cuisine, which is harmful for our health. Ċ First and foremost, people desire to save some period by not having to cook. Increasingly, our life has become more and more engaged due to the fact that overwork. Thus, we don’t want to spend our point in order to make some foodstuff. Without doubt, it will be quite beneficial for our work and therefore we will have some while from ordering a ready-made meal. For example, people use this saved time to carry out new projects or they can do things which they cannot do at work. As to why, prepared meals can be advantageous for the work of people. Ċ On the other hand, most of prepared meals are convenience meat, that has not many of the vitamins essential to health. For instance, people order prepared food such as: hamburger, hot dog, as well as pizza and Mexican tacos and so on. As I know, these meals considered to be fast cooking and also they are known to be high in cholesterol, which can be a contributory factor in heart disease. That is why, we have to try to prepare meals ourselves and it must be a nourished meal. Ċ In conclusion, ordering food from restaurants may be extremely useful for a busy person who has no period for cooking. But as I have above mentioned that we pay attention that it has cons, which is harmless for our health."
9441,"Some people believe that unemployment people should be made to work for their welfare/benefit payments. Others, however, see this as cheap labor.  Discuss the possible advantages and disadvantages of making unemployment people take any job. Do you believe that making unemployed people work is a good idea?","People need a job to fill their financial needs. While some people argue that unemployment should become an employee to earn money for their living, others believe that they only can be a part of low-payment worker in companies. I would argue that if they do some works, they might decrease number of unemployment in the certain country, while they are also lack of skills and experiences to do specifics jobs. Making unemployment work with running their owned business is the best idea. Ċ Unemployment is still a prolific problem for some countries. Making them to be an employee will help government to minimize the number of people who do not have any job even the budget for taking care of them. On the other hand, they are lack of some competences to compete the other professional workers as the most beneficial people for company. Since they have low qualifications, company will give them the lowest position related with their ability. Ċ In my opinion, I strongly believe that unemployment should encourage themselves to build their own business for their living. They do not need to have some difficulties being a worker in company, or have unchanged low-position with minimum payment. This strategy not only valuable for government but also individuals who are more independent even create new jobs for others. Ċ To sum up, I do believe unemployment should be driven to be more independent for their living than just rely on company as employer. Government should give them financial support to run their business."
9442,Some people think children should obey rules and do what the teachers want them to do. Others think controlled children are not well-prepared for children's adult life in future.,"Whenever and wherever, the topic, how to educate the next generation, keeps heated to be discussed. Some people say that children should do what they are asked by teachers, while I insist that controlling children has no advantages of their lives. Ċ Granted, it is commonly accepted that the rules made by teachers can, to some extent, avoid students driving a' stray. As we all know, that young students lack of the ability to distinguish right from wrong. If there is no restriction from teachers, a sea of the students may fight with classmates, even become thieves or robbers. In fact, a few of students are aggressive and interested in illegal deeds. Thus, it is necessary for the teachers to give students some rules to obey. Ċ Nevertheless, these restrictions do harm for the development of students' mind. It is indisputable that if one wishes to be a successful person, she or he must have unique character. What is more, a person - who is outstanding of his or her area - is usually independent. In order to cultivate children to have these significant characters, they should allow doing what they want to do, no matter how old they are. Yet, teachers are supposed to give them useful advices to let them know whether their activities are justified or inaccurate. Ċ To sum up, I reaffirm that though controlling children is helpful for children to become the excellent students, it is no merit for their adult lives. As a result, what the teachers should do is to give their students some rules to avoid them doing illegal behavior, instead of restricting them."
9443,"Topic: It is important for travelers and business people to understand the cultures they come into contact with, however briefly. What are the main advantages of doing so? What do you think is the main disadvantage of not doing so?","These days the number of visitors who are travel to foreign countries has been markedly increased. Culture awareness lead to many benefits as well as there are many problems for those who do not understand culture. Ċ Misunderstanding of culture would cause many problems for both side: the native and the foreigner. Take for example someone who use body language without taking into account inhabitants' culture, would insulting religious customs. For instance, in Muslim countries shaking hand with alien women is forbidden; Moreover wearing scarf and loose-fitting clothes is common among Muslims nations due to feeling secure as written in holy Quran. As a result it is better to take some research in advance to familiar much more with destination. Thus cultural misunderstanding has many drawbacks. Ċ On the other hand understanding foreign countries cultures, would reduce the tension of first conversation and lead to feeling confidence when talking or moving. For instance, success finger sign have different meaning in middle-east region. In addition much more culture awareness the passenger have the less culture shock they would encounter. Culture shock is feeling of anxious and confused that you get by visiting new culture. Besides knowing others culture brings the chance of experiencing to contact with original inhabitants. Therefore being conversant with new environment and people have tremendous advantages. Ċ In conclusion, being aware of where to go and how to contact with for both type of travelers should be taken into account in advance. Consequently those who are aware are likely to experience satisfactory journey."
9444,"Nowadays, more people would rather purchase food than cook at home. Ċ What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?","It is undeniable that an increasing number of communities nowadays rather than cook at home. From my perspective, consider purchasing foodstuff rather than cooking at home.From my perspective,even though purchasing meat offers advantages, it is also wastes of money. Ċ On the one hand, one of the advantages of purchasing a drink or a meal is that it is convenient and comfortable. To illustrate , society who have a busy day, therefore they consider purchasing the food at the dining room where near their homes on their offices. Besides, Ordering food is not required to clean it after. For instance, the meal is put in a plastic box or some individuals can consume the meals at the restaurant. Moreover, some others are not able to make their own foods nor do not have cooking skills Add the comma(s), in particular,It appears that you are missing a comma or two with the interrupter in particular. Consider adding the comma(s). Ċ show examplesin particular they are disabled people. In this case, purchasing a meal is suitable for them. Ċ On the other hand, consider order meal offer disadvantages . One of the disadvantages is that they waste money because the price of food is more expensive than the price of buying ingredients cooking food at residence.Consequently, their expenditures will increase. Furthermore, these people will not improve their cooking skills due to purchasing a Pood as well as buying meals from a restaurant could be awful and affect their healths . For example, people who are allergic to ingredients and vegetarians will not know what ingredients restaurants use to cook. In other words, they do not know in a dining room, they do not know recipes of food in the cafeteria Ċ To summarize, purchasing foodstuff offers benefits for the community and people who cannot cook, although purchasing meals can offer drawbacks. Both of these have benefits and drawbacks that have to be considered by consumers."
9445,Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear. Ċ On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication. Ċ On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture. Ċ In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture."
9446,"if a product is sold and people but it, then advertising is not necessary and can be considered a kind of entertainment. do you agree or disagree with this","It has been said that a running item has not required to advertise, instead it can be recognised an a way of amusement. I completely disagree with this statement, because without promotional activities, it is not possible to exist in the competitive market as well as update people about new features. Ċ First of all, media broadcasting is necessary to keep live an ongoing piece. There are many competitors in the business world, where most of them are using ads to reach their target consumers. In such circumstance, if a hit item is not viewed on the television, newspaper or internet for a long period, it is highly possible to disappear that from customers conscience; because, there are plenty of alternatives shown on the screen, which might grasp their mind to buy. Therefore, to retain own place, marketing is must. For example, Lax, a renown international cosmetic brand, has millions of consumers, but still continuing to broadcast their products in every possible medium to stay in their position. Ċ Likewise, promoting also required for informing users about up-gradation. Although an item or service is popular enough, it can come out with a new version or additional characteristics. Hence, while the modernization news of the ongoing good is released in the public platform, it will create a sense among the buyers to purchase, or else it would not hold that much user concern, and with the progress time becomes a flop one. For instance, a Bangladeshi well-liked soap named ""Cosco"" became vanished with lack of sufficient marketing afterwards. Ċ In conclusion, despite some people say that well-accepted products have no need of advertising, I believe it is significant to sustain in the platform and letting people know about the recent developments."
9447,Nowadays many countries have very cosmopolitan cities with people from all over the world. How can the government ensure that all these people can live together harmoniously?,"In various nations around the world, big cities are filled with people from many parts of the world. While this offers advantages, the government need to look into how these people can live in harmony. Ċ There are few possible courses of action to ensure harmonious living. In the first place, the government could launch a nationwide campaign to raise public awareness about the importance of culture differences. For instance, advertisements by the ministry of culture and community about the danger of social friction should be regularly shown on television. Another way forward could be for local communities hold cultural events, so that people can understand various cultures surrounding them. If people understand the cultural differences amongst themselves, the frictions can be lessened. Ċ In addition to that, the authority can also tap on education system to educate children about cultural differences. For example, In Jakarta, culture and sociology are subjects taught in classes. The reason is that Jakarta as Indonesia’s capital city, has many people who come to study and work. Thus, teaching about social interaction from young could play a crucial part of the society in future. Ċ In conclusion, social frictions can happen anywhere when there are diversities, but there are many ways that the government can ensure harmonious living amongst its citizen. As mentioned above, tapping on media and education system can help to reduce these risks. Given this situation, it is crucial that the government should take the steps immediately in order to ensure peace and harmony of its residents."
9448,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In 20 years from now on, students will not use printed books any more.","There is a trend that more and more people would like to buy a kindle or an ipad to read e-books. It seems that nobody is willing spend a lot of money to buy a printed book which is heavy and thick. As a result, somebody states that, students will not use printed books any more after 20 years. However, I don't agree with this viewpoint. Ċ First of all, it is not practical to convert the copies of all published books into e-books. This exercise will involve high costs and labor that would be hard to justify. For example, there are large amount of books in our school library. It takes time, money and human resources for school to buy and keep these books. If a library transformed all their books in to electronic resources, it would take huge cost. And I think no school could burden this payout. Ċ Secondly, it's impossible to transform all printed books into e-books, cause there are some certain kinds of books that should be kept in its original form for their special use and potential value. For example, the ancient books used for historical and literary research, which we have to read carefully by wearing a pair of gloves, must be kept in a specific place of the library. For another example, some books that are out of print or printed in limited edition always have collection value. Ċ Moreover, some students claim that they prefer printed books than e-books because it's easy to take notes on paper. And more importantly, the electronic equipment doesn't touch like a book. Ċ We can't deny that e-book does have its advantages over traditional printed book. It's convenient to carry, easy to share with others and so on. And we can imagine the future in which e-books are widely used in the world. But the printed book, with its own value and function, will not be completely replaced by e-books."
9449,"In any field — business, politics, education, government — those in power should step down after five years. Do you agree?","Some people argue that the leaders of business, government, politics or any other field should be in charge for no more than five years. From my point of view, it is definitely justifiable because this approach may benefit both the individuals and the industries. This essay firstly will present the advantages of stepping down after five years of performing in high managerial positions for individuals and after that, the benefits for the industries of this will be provided. Ċ The people, who have the power in their hand, by managing a company, business or even the government may gain several advantages of the voluntarily leaving their positions after five years. I think that, the period of five years is enough time for a strong leader to demonstrate his or her professional knowledge and skills in any field. Moreover, after this time a leader may become bored by doing the same duties and lose motivation to perform a work effectively. So, changing a career is a perfect tool to refresh professional experience that may bring new incredible opportunities for the leaders such as growth, professional development and new network. Ċ On the other hand, the industries also need the new energetic leaders for the sustainable growth. It cannot be denied that all people have different strengths and approaches to solve a problem as well as different values and visions. Therefore, when one leader replaces another leader, the industry may gain new opportunities for development. For example, a new leader may implement a new successful strategy or launch a new product or service. It is obvious that any field required new ideas and strategies for a sustainable growth; hence, changing the management is a one way to achieve this goal. Ċ In conclusion, I do believe that any leaders should leave their positions after five years because it may provide the benefits for both the individual and industry."
9450,many employers are employing people with good skills as well as good qualifications. do you agree or disagree that good skills are as important as good qualifications to succeed in a job?,"Nowadays, many recruiters are in favour of choosing candidates with both interpersonal and technical skills. I completely agree that this is the best method in evaluating and employing new individuals in a company. Ċ Firstly, It is commonly known that unlike good educational qualifications, social skills are hard to teach. In other words, interpersonal qualities such as team-work, communication skills and the ability of listening actively are a result in engaging in several activities while growing up. Those characteristics are either born in a human being or taught during their childhood. Hence, it is essential to examine if a candidate has the right social skills as much as their technical skills because they are not easily taught to an adult. For instance, individuals who were encouraged to participate in community work in their childhood will build a team work spirit better than a kid who spent most of his time playing video games individually. Ċ Secondly, socials kills are vital in recruiting a candidate in order to save and maintain a healthy work environment. To put it differently, a healthy workplace requires several effort from both employees and employers. Having a colleague who lacks the team spirit, adaptability, and listening qualities will create a negative tension between co-workers. As a result, employees will get motivated, frustrated and unwilling to cooperate together. For example, employees who chose to work together to achieve a task or meet a deadline will not only speed up the pace of the work but also improve the quality of work. Ċ In conclusion, social skills are harder to grasp as a person grows older, on the contrary of educational and technical skills that are taught by either experience or college."
9451,Some people say that the teaching method with a teacher and students in a classroom will not exist by the year 2050. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Over recent years there as been an enormous increase in the speculation ideas regarding education. Plenty of people predict that education process with a teacher and student in a classroom will disappear in 2050. This paper is partly agree with the statement. Although a great deal factors perhaps people will leave the system, learning process in the school still will become major choice for children to obtain more knowledge. Ċ The number of criminal behaviors in school showed by media in worldwide over the last decade force some parents to withdraw their children of the school, it will affect that they will seek out more efficient system for their relatives. Home schooling may be an appropriate alternative to this case, the system, known as one-to-one lessons allow much faster progress, will be specially interested to be implemented in the future. Also, sophisticated technology which provides a wide amount of information and knowledge will change the way people studying in the next decade. Ċ However, there are number of reasons why people will keep consistently using the method. Firstly, the system - with a teacher and many student in a classroom - offers knowledge and moral values such as tolerance and sharing, which prepares student to be a ready member of society. In addition, parents who do not have more time to protect their children will still believe this tract as method for studying. Therefore, the process will remain intact in the future. Ċ To sum up, it is evident that teaching method invests constantly positive effect for students, while many optional ways can be chosen to obtain knowledge in the future. Government should have careful planning about this trend to create terrific future generations."
9452,"TOPIC: Some people believe that for school children, their teachers have more influence on their intelligence and social development than parents. Others argue that parents are not less important. Discuss both views and give your opinions.","While some people believe that teachers have a greater bearing on school-aged children's cognitive and social development than parents, others argue that the role of parents is of the same importance as that of teachers. I side with the latter view. Ċ On the one hand, teachers have a monumental role in children's comprehensive development. School-aged children can gain insights into the world and have the ability to reason thanks to the knowledge that teachers impart. Students are also taught moral codes and social etiquette at schools. The basic knowledge and moral lessons which students receive from their teachers would be the main factors determining children's future life. Therefore, it is justifiable why many people believe teachers have a dispensable role in children's cognitive and social development. Ċ However, it would be imprudent to downplay the role of parents in helping the young become academically and socially capable. Ċ Teachers provide students with a wealth of knowledge, however, their efforts would be futile if students did not revise their lessons due to the lack of parents' supervision. In addition, as children spend most of their time with their parents, they may be influenced by their parents' behaviors although these actions may contradict the virtues taught at schools. For example, a kid raised by abusive parents may have the tendency to be violent later on in his life because this child imitated their parents' actions during his childhood. Therefore, parents also have a significant influence on children's personal growth. Ċ In conclusion, I would contend that efforts from both teachers and parents would help children to be intellectually and socially capable."
9453,"In some part of the world, it is increasingly popular to research the history of one's own family. Why do people want to do this? Is it a positive or negative development? People are interested in their ancestry","Searching family history is increasing in popularity in some regions. There could be several reasons for this and I consider it to be both positive and negative trend. Ċ There are two reasons why people grow great interest in finding their family roots. First, the availability of several family searching websites has encouraged more people to do genealogy. These websites allow them to create family trees and find long distant relatives, which fascinate those who are inquisitive in their ancestors' origin. Tracking medical history is another reason. Some chronic diseases can be diagnosed in advance if people are aware of their family background. For example, by doing research on family history, ones not only prevent genetic disorders during their pregnancy but also have healthier babies. Ċ On the one hand, doing genealogy can be extremely positive. As people gain insights into their ancestors' lives, they also learn about family's traditions and contributions, which helps to preserve family history. Additionally, family background awareness is of benefit to later generation because it can bridge the generation gap and form a stronger unity. On the other hand, the search of family history also results in negative consequences. There are some cultural practices that are better not knowing since they are inappropriate in present days. Should people to find out the dark sides of their family members, it can cause embarrassment or resentment. For example, many people find it hard to accept the fact that their ancestors were slave owners although the practice used to be legal in some countries. Ċ In conclusion, the accessible of family related websites and medical purposes are the main reasons that lead to the rise of family history tracing. Genealogy certainly benefits family members; however, it also does harm to the ties of kinship."
9454,Ielts- Some people argue that teaching children of different abilities together benefits all of them. Others be;ieve that intelligent children should be tought seperately and given special treatment. Discuss both views and how do you think about it? What is the difference of genious children comparing with ordinary children? Shoud they recieve the special education exceptionally?,"The study of the way to teach intelligent children has surveyed for many years now. In this essay, I will analysis both side about this problem. Ċ To begin with, some people have arguments that intelligent children Should be tought seperately and give special treatment. There are several reasons of these opinion. Ċ Firstly, the genious is obiously diffrent from other children. Although their appearence is same comparing with their freinds,, their knowledge is superior than peers. They are able to get a lot of knowledge as well as contribute to their country. For this reason, the society gives seperated place and education to enhance their abilities. Ċ Secondly, the genious might be suffered from the class. For exemple, one smart child already might understand about one's class. They would feel boring in their class. On the other hand, there are oppsite opinions that they are also tought in same class with all of them. Tomas A. Edison said ""Geious is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration."" it means the genious not different. In addition, the briliant child is not mature emotionally. Therefore they are likely to be hurt, when they are studing with other older students or scholars. Moreover they can feel lonely in that thay are differentfrom others. Many people hope that they not only become famous scholar but also will find new priciples or theories. these might make them pressed. Ċ In conclusion, people have different thinking about the education about genious children. In my view, depends upon their mind. Let them be themselves."
9455,"Many people believe that in order to have clean and tidy streets in their neighborhood, this should be the residents' responsibility, while others think that it should be the governments' duty. what is your opinion?","It is true that if people want to maintain clearer nature in their streets, they will probably need the residential support, while a large number of people insist that the obligation of undertaking the condition wholly belongs to the government. In my personal opinion, I think that residential authorities should monitor streets as much as the government do.  Ċ To begin with, I think that providing pure nature should be the permanent task for individuals, whereas resident owners should keep on encouraging people do not pollute surrounding as well. In other words, the most effective method to deter dwellers from making dust is to impose rules which breakers will be strictly punished by the local policy. Furthermore, it would be better for people to concern about the issue and give frequent support in order to raise awareness among their neighbours. The harder penalties will be, the sooner a problem will be solved. Ċ On the other hand, although the policy may ease the issue, it should have real power, which is originally provided by the government and its members. Government, in fact, are the most powerful construction, which represents the constitution of a particular country. Subsequently, the government has a great deal in street purification. Moreover, it invests enormous money to help the population to provide a clean environment by enacting the latest washing machines and innovations. Unfortunately, sometimes people neglecting the law and continue the everyday contamination process, and I am afraid that it soon will lead to inevitable consequences. Thus, it is extremely important that the government tackle the problem as soon as possible. Ċ To conclude, I consider that only with joint efforts of the residents and the government we can finally get a wise solution for the problem of modern streets and regions."
9456,Government should spend money to increase the development of sport and art for school students rather than supporting professional sport and art performances for general public. Do you agree or disagree?,"Some people, including me argue that law enforcing agency should concentrate and spend their budget on school cultural activities rather than spending money for professional sports. However, there is a group supporting to spend more money towards public performance, not towards school's activity. The following essay states the points to support my opinion. Ċ Firstly, in this modern world, it has been observed that lifestyle diseases are increasing a lot. This is mainly due to unhealthy eating habits and lack of physical exercise. So if the government can introduce extra-curriculum activities in the early educational classes, then it will help to make sure that kids are getting enough fitness time and the authority can protect them from lifestyle illness. For instance, in Kerala, the law agencies have started giving importance to sports and art from kinder gardens, which in turn, energized the students increased their concentration level in the studies. Ċ Secondly, most of the time, the early exposure to extra activities, may lights to create a hobby and later the hobby turns into as a profession. Furthermore, nowadays, competitions are there along with the practise. If a student won in the school race, then he will be eligible to enter in the district level and this will go till national level. By this way the educational system is creating athletes. For example, in Kerela, the state spent more than 15% of their budget to have cultural activities and training. This has given a very positive response from every citizen and most of the sports and arts persons have been identified from here. Ċ In conclusion, it is always good to spend a region's budget to encourage physical activities in the primary and secondary as this often leads to develop athletes and professionals to develop the country standard."
9457,Successful companies use advertisements to make more sales. What can make an Ċ advertisement effective? Do you think advertisements are a bad thing or a good thing for society?,"Advertising is a core feature in building a marketable brand. Many business owners believe that adequately promoting their work will in turn improve sales of products. This essay will discuss the effect of advertisement on a brand and also give my opinion on the usefulness of this strategy to the community. Ċ To begin with, the major aspect of effective marketing is getting to know your target market. Here, the promoters of these businesses need to understand their proposed consumer population and how to reach out to them. Also, in the world today, in other to create awareness on particular ware, it is advisable to reach to the audience who can actually purchase them. For instance, the publication of the use of sanitary pads should be focused more on the female population such as in schools, televisions and seminars as they are majorly the consumers of these commodities. Therefore, in other to say that an advert is effective, it has to be strategically placed so that it can reach the audience who actually needs them. Ċ On the other hand, the usefulness of creating a strategic awareness of trade cannot be overly emphasized. This goes a long way in increasing sales and bringing popularity to the business as publicity of commodities not only create an understanding of the goods but also helps in making sure that the merchandise is sold out to make a profit. For example, if the product is not announced to the public, it will bring in little profit and it will have a negative influence on the variety inhibiting the growth. So, better product perception to the public is a smart choice to make in improving a brand. Ċ In conclusion, I strongly believe that the effective use of well-structured adverts will not only create popularity to the wares but will also bring in returns of investment."
9458,Some people think computers and the Internet have more benifit than schools so schools will disappear from our lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In current society, technological means are advancing at an amazing speed, which has transformed our lives, especially in the field of education. Even though some people argue that computers and the Internet are of utmost importance in assisting a child's learning, I firmly believe this learning should be guided and directed by experience of teachers. Ċ There is no denying the fact that due to technological advances, modern methods are widely used in schooling. As knowledge can be presented in a vivid and novel way, they enable students to have a good commend of what has been taught as well as to give children vital skills in readiness for later life. However, the extensive use of the Internet will give rise to some adverse effects, for instance, the website may not be a reliable source of knowledge, since there is often conflicting information available when taken from different sources. By that I mean, students will be comfused by a great deal of controversial information and accept so-called knowlege indiscriminately. Ċ A school is a place where students gather to be educated and learn from each other, which is a tranditional and long-established practice in all countries. At school, students are divided according to their academic performance and learn things though understanding. Apart from acquiring knowledge, students profit from participating non-academic activities with peers, in terms of team spirit and moral values, which can never be provided by computers. Ċ In conclusion, modern technologis and tranditonal methods are not mutually exclusive. I feel that computers and the Internet can complement some teaching and learning methods, without being used as replacement for those tranditions."
9459,"With access to the internet and social media websites, many children are exposed to a number of dangerous situations. Adults should thus limit access to the internet for their children. Ċ Do you agree or disagree?","Although the internet has revolutionized the world and is used by everyone now including the younger generation, there are few negative consequences it has when misused. I absolutely agree that elder ones should keep a keen eye on what their kids are doing online. In the first part of the essay, we will discuss the negative effects it can have individually and in the later part, we will discuss its social effects. Ċ Firstly, teenagers are getting addicted to pornography which is readily available on the net these days. To further explain, these unethical and immoral things on the net have a devastating effect on the mentality of the youngsters. For example, watching porn movies can be a cause of depression and it has a debilitating effect on the physical health of a person. Therefore, parents should block access to these sites and monitor the usage of it in their homes, thus ensuring that their offsprings are safe from these indecent data available on the web. Ċ Secondly, there is a social evil that is rising day-by-day and is named as “online bullying”. To elaborate, the young people nowadays are taking to the internet for making fun of each other by commenting on the looks and appearance of one another and this unethical act of them can have a serious consequence. For instance, one of the boys in a primary school in China committed suicide because he was heckled on social media by his classmate for being fat. As a result, a student will suffer from severe trauma which can destroy his carrier and, in some cases, it can push him to take his life. Ċ To conclude, the Internet could have an adverse effect on the mental and physical health of a person if used to watch adultery videos, as well as it is used by some immature kids to tease others on social media sites which could be mental harassment for the victim."
9460,"Some people believe that it is essential to include Physical Education classes in the curriculum Ċ children, others think that for all school age children's time is better spent on more academic subjects. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion","Education is a key to the future, and schools have a huge responsibility for the studying plan, made for their students. While some people believe that sport is necessary as a part of the educational program, others insist that classical subjects as math, physics, chemistry and other academic topics are more important for youngsters. This essay will discuss both aspects of this issue before reaching any opinion. Ċ On the one hand, the physical exercises cannot provide the skills, which will be helpful to pass entering exams to universities. There is a competition to enter into any university, and often applicants should perform their best intellectual ability by taking challenging tests. For example, Harvard University requires the knowledge of different areas of natural science, humanitarian studies and exact science. As a result, only the most intelligent people in the world could become a part of this elite school, spending a lot of their time studying, but not running, dancing or playing football. Moreover, sport can be dangerous for young talented geniuses, and it's very important to avoid the activities and prevent the brain from trauma. Ċ On the other hand, not everyone is born to become a member of an elite university. In other words, there is a lot of ways how to live our own life and reach personal happiness. For instance, many girls and boys, involved in physical activity such as jogging or playing basketball, improving their strength, cooperative and communication skills, which bring them a powerful source of self-esteem. Hence, the sport could be an essential part of children education, especially for those, who cannot make a strong decision about the future in the early stages of life. Furthermore, physical activity helps to develop the connection between different parts of the brain, and it makes the nervous system really strong against daily stress. Ċ In conclusion, there are various points of view about containing educational schedule in school, and I believe that different students have specific preferences. Therefore, the best thing that school can offer to pupils is to make the choice of subjects free and voluntary, because everyone should meet their own needs. In my opinion, the most important thing is paying attention to the personality of characters and ambitions because we should respect the individual ones."
9461,Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. Ċ To what extent do you agree? Ċ You should write at least 250 words.,"The character of famous people leaves a profound image on adolescents' minds and various means of media are playing a vital role in this area. In this essay, I will discuss that celebrities' public action cultivates positive as well as negative impressions on young ones' minds. Ċ On the first hand, the constructive media publicity of the public figure motivates teenagers to build their careers. The young generation does not only follow their role model but also try to mimic their actions in their real-life by learning from their biography broadcasted by various channels. For example, the Indian cricketer, M. S. Dhoni, has inspired many youngsters by publishing his biography about his struggle and how he achieved success. Hence, the creative coverage of media performs an important role in one's learning about their hero's life. Ċ On the other hand, the negative publicity of the famous person leaves a detrimental impact on their followers. Many reporters are following film stars in their private parties and then releases the after-party footage of them where they are observed either drinking or smoking publicly. To illustrate, the Indian actor, Shah Rukh Khan, has been spotted many times with an alcohol bottle in hand which has inspired many to consume the same. Thus, such an incident provokes young adults to get attracted to bad habits. Ċ To conclude, though the activities of the popular person can be inspirational for someone, it can foster the wrong impression as well if it is not conveyed wisely. It is the onus of broadcasters to decide what to display and what not by considering the future of the young audience."
9462,Some people believe that living in big cities is becoming more difficult. Others believe that it is getting easier. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"It is believed by some that it is easier to live in metropolitan cities while others oppose this viewpoint. This essay shall explain both views and my opinion. Ċ The major advantage of living in the big city is that all the amenities such as public transport, medical services are available 24 hours 7 days a week. A good illustration of this could be a person who is a resident of a megacity can give satisfaction to his/her late-night cravings anytime because restaurants and other dining places are open all day in these cities. Additionally, people in modern cities never sleep because they are working around the clock due to increased job opportunities and flexibility given by international companies by opening the offices till the late hour of the night. Ċ There are some drawbacks of living in the urban areas from which the important one is increased extent of pollution of any kind and the prices of accommodation are higher as compared to the rural areas. For instance, a large number of people must go to work using their own vehicles or public transport, which causes air and noise pollution. Furthermore, the living expenses are higher in the big cities as the similar accommodation can be found in less price just further away from the developed areas of the city. Moreover, people are familiar with each other in small towns which sets a nice example of love top the upcoming generations. Ċ To sum up, I believe that, urban life has its drawbacks but it gives the chance to people to become more civilized, tolerant and open-minded as well as modernized living makes adults independent which helps in personal growth as an individual."
9463,Some countries have come up with law to restrict the working hours of an employee. What is the reason for this ? Is that positive or negative ?,"Optimization of working hours has always been challenging for the Human Resource Departments across the globe. In the world of “Hard workers and Smart workers”, it is indeed challenging to decide the standard working hours for the employees. However, many developed countries consider limiting working hours to boost their employees' performance. This essay sheds some lights on various reasons behind such movement and its possible outcomes. Ċ Firstly, “All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy.” An employee’s wellbeing plays a major role in the performance of an organization. Many researches have proven that overworking employees having inadequate personal time, lack physical activities and sleep due to which they are often lethargic, tedious and sick. In Contrary, balanced workers are found to be healthy and energetic at their workplace. For an instance, the Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Sweden have six hours a day working policy to encourage workers' physical fitness and have witnessed a positive growth. Ċ Secondly, a happy and healthy employee is an asset to any company. Workers lacking personal time and social time are very prone to anxiety, stress and depression which hamper their deliveries at work. Furthermore, they are less likely to take any challenging role as they tend to avoid risks involved with it. Adequate rest has always proven to boost employees' efficiency at work. To exemplify, Japan Microsoft has introduced four working hours a day policy which profited them by 40% in a quarter. Ċ In conclusion, an optimized working hour gives workers a good breathing space, which motivates and energize them to perform better every day. Hence, by limiting working hours seems to be a win-win situation for both the organization and its employees."
9464,Which do you feel is more important in your life: security or freedom and independence? Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.,"There are no such things as freedom and security without independence. It is simply impossible. You cannot live freely and secured while your country is occupied. Consequently, those things are hand in hand . As analysed above, I have a strong belief that all of them are pivotal. Ċ On one side of the coin, independence is the thing that is imperative in order to obtain both security and freedom. To clarify it, numerous countries are fighting for their independence. For the reason that, they know, once they obtain it. Then it will lead them toward freedom and security. In other words, their citizens will be furnished with safety and freedom. Which are the things that every single country on this planet desires. Ċ On the other side of the coin, an independent nation means free and secured nation. Thus, those qualities cannot be separated. Furthermore, the only way to obtain freedom and security is by possessing absolute independence. Freedom and security cannot exist, while there is no truly achieved independence. Ċ Those are qualities that really are attached to each other. We cannot choose one of them. Because of the logical aforementioned reason. In addition to that, people who are living in an occupied country can never feel secured and free since they will constantly be worrying about their life and kids even their futures. Thus, the certain country must have an independence to let their people experience the safeness and freedom. Their surroundings must be stable and safe and only from that moment ,their people can truly feel freedom and security simultaneously. Ċ By way of a conclusion based on the arguments explored above. I firmly believe that independence must exist in order to have both freedom and security. That is why those 3 qualities can not be detached."
9465,Nowadays many business meetings and training are happening online and not in real offices. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages in this matter?,"In recent years ,there is a tremendous change in the mode of communication at the workplaces. Various aspects of the companies are being discussed in virtual meetings conducted online, decreasing the age-old physical meetings. In my opinion, there are many advantages while using this system. In this essay, I would discuss the given statement and support my opinion with relevant examples. Ċ On one hand, online meetings are beneficial in many ways.Firstly, they can be conducted at any time within the office hours and can be easily organized without any prior preparation.As a result , a lot of time can be saved both for the organisation and the employee. Secondly, these meetings can be conducted on an international scale as anyone can be connected just by joining it. For example, we can easily show our statistics to the overseas clients and discuss with them immediately thus proving our calibre instantly. Newcomers can get involved in the work even before they physically start doing it when they are given an overall picture of their daily routine in the online training. Ċ On the other hand, as every garden has weeds, there are some cons related to these virtual gatherings.Sometimes, due to the network issues , we may lose a connection while discussing an important strategy. Moreover, the talk people do and the work they finish cannot be the same. For instance, as the amount of the job done cannot be seen in the online instantly ,many times, people may boast their work. Ċ To conclude, after listing down both the advantages and disadvantages of these new-age web meetings , I strongly believe that there are a lot more pros in organising virtual gatherings than physical ones in the companies."
9466,"Despite a variety of sport facilities and gyms, people are less fit nowadays than ever before. Ċ What do you think are the main causes of this problem? Ċ What solutions can you suggest?","Despite the fact that the number of places to work out has grown exponentially, the obesity percentage is more than in the past. In my view, the main reasons are the type of cuisine that we are consuming and the lifestyle of our contemporary life. Below I will discuss these factors with solutions that both governments and persons should do. Ċ To begin with, overweight and fitness problems are always associated with unhealthy meals which affect our body or our attempt to be in shape. To be more precise, eating fast food after doing a scheduled activity in gyms is a common practice nowadays which is clearly a reason to be an unfit poor poor health condition. In addition to eating rubbish food, the busy life where folks are spending more time working in firms rather than looking after their strength or their body shape. For instance, work hours nowadays are consuming almost half of the day which mean that the time that is dedicated to enhancing body strength or loss some weight is not enough. Ċ On the other hand, there are many ways to tackle this issue but in my view, the important ones are; more regulations on the fast-food industry and encourage individuals to involve in sports facilities. In terms of regulations, governments must take serious measurements to reduce the number of fast-food establishments as well as imposing more taxes for both producers and buyers. For example, low prices of unhealthy meals are the main reason for the high demand on it so, if the prices go up, the demand is going to decline immediately, Another factor to consider is motiving people to participate in gyms and other physical places. In other words, media has a crucial role to promote how beneficial it is to be in a good appeal and the positive consequences of being in a perfect shape. Ċ In conclusion, the widespread of unhealthy meal providers in addition to our busy lifestyle nowadays are the major causes of abandon physical facilities. However, the most effective solutions are to practice more control over unhealthy manufactories at the same time with encouraging individuals to do some activities as a daily routine."
9467,"In some schools, teacher teach a foreign language to student of primary language to student of the introductory class. What are the advantages and disadvantages associated with this phenomenon? Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","In today’s modernistic period, the world has become much smaller with the advancement in communication. The teachers of some schools are introducing their undergraduate to a different language, thus enhancing their means of Socialization with other countries. I think the occurrence of this proposal can have many benefits; however, we cannot deny its disadvantages. Ċ Firstly, learning a foreign vocabulary has several perks that can lead to an infinite increase in students’ knowledge, which will help them in their mental development very well. In other words, a student who is well versed in a foreign language can perform his job responsibilities in any country in the world. For example, French is Canada’s most widely spoken speech. So, excellent arrangements are made in schools to teach it, including trained French teachers and erudite study materials; this will lead them to get their higher education in Canada in a very comfortable way to get the desired job. Ċ Nevertheless, we should also consider some detriments including an increase in the cost of teaching an alien expression to students, which is essential to consider carefully. Put another way, fee in today’s high institutes are already skyrocketing, which parents are already having a hard time paying. For instance, international level schools like “Cambridge world school” charges students an approximate value of 1 lac per year as a fee for a primary class that is almost impossible for an average parent to deal with these issues. Ċ Finally, having discussed the topic at length, there is no denying the fact that an external dialect is efficient and advantageous for a child’s innovative advancement. Despite that, adding subjects to the daily syllabus increases school fees. Therefore, it is imperative to curb these overwhelming debts; consequently, every child can progress and live life to the fullest."
9468,Many people have job that involve working shifts (working at night). What are some of the problems that shift workers might face? What can be done to solve them?,"There are many people who are doing night shifts. This essay will address problems like health hazards and disruption in family and social life, and also proposes effective solutions like rotating rosters and family support. Ċ To commence with, working on nights has a direct effect on sleep. If a sleeping hour of a staff is reduced every day, he will be a victim of various diseases like anxiety, depression and mental health issue. For example, according The University of England, 55% of employer who works night time is having the problem of anxiety. Likewise, working as a third shift will have a negative influence in the family and social relationship. That is to say, working lately, does not give enough time to the partner and children, which results in family dysfunction. Additionally, the involvement in social activities will also be reduced, which results in social marginalisation. Ċ On the other hand, the first solution for such problem can be a rotating roster among the workers. Despite of a single person working the same night duty every week, if there is a rotating schedule, they can rest and the chance of suffering from various diseases is minimized. For instance, the WHO published a report in January 2020, that staff working in a swing shift is healthier than those who are working the same roster every day. Secondly, a full support of the family can make the night roster effective. If they are on the ball and maintains a peaceful environment at home so that the person working late shifts can take a rest, it won’t be hard working lately. Ċ In conclusion, doing graveyard shift can create various problems like health issues and disruption in family and social life; however rotating work schedule and support of family can help to minimize this issue."
9469,"Some people think that with combined effort on the part of the government and society crime can be completely eradicated, while others argue that this is completely hypothetical, and that crime has always been present in societies even in an ancient time. Ċ Discuss these two views. Which one do you agree with?","In recent years, the issue related to committing a crime has attracted the public’s attention. Some experts believe that a wide range of criminals completely is controlled by state laws and regulations, while others oppose that it is impossible to eliminate offensiveness in societies. I completely agree with the latter perspective and both views of this controversy will be given in the following paragraphs. Ċ As for the first aspect, it is undeniable that poverty is the potential factor leading people to commit a violation. What this means is that individuals belonging to low-income, jobless and uneducated groups are more likely to violate the legislation. Thus, the government need to thoroughly provide education and professional skills matching with employment and labour demand in the jobs market. In addition, the public can implement a collaborative attempt. For example, the measure namely “Community Watch” – a crime prevention program – involves citizens working with each other and with regulation enforcement agencies to mitigate misdemeanour and victimization in their communities. As a result, life security and the landscape of personally residential property could be effectively prevented from criminals. Ċ Regarding the second viewpoint, transgression could not be totally obliterated, despite having established laws for the control of habitual criminals in several countries. It is common to believe that insufficient enforcement of the law is the vital variable of re-offended behaviour. Furthermore, turning to undisputed answer, whether the public can assure about justice if police officer becomes an offender because of corruption in the police community. For instance, Thailand – one of the countries having the highest corruption index in the world – is a place in which all sorts of felonies can be legal by providing a huge amount of bribes to officers. Ċ In conclusion, crime still exists in every community, but there are potential ways to tackle such matters, or at least minimise the effects. Consequently, the law ministry must implement a harsh punishment and have an independent institute scrutinizing frauds and corruption in police sectors."
9470,"The older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave. However, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life.  Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?","About 30 years ago, the lives of our parents and grandparents are very different now, at that time they still had no opportunity to contact the digital life like today. But I don’t think that the ideas of older people are no longer useful for the current generation. The elderly have valuable experiences that can be passed on and they are also helpful labour forces of society. Ċ No matter what era, there are old people, and they are people who have experienced many things in their life, especially as they get more knowledge about aspects of life. Although, the young people are quick-witted, they should also listen to advices from the elderly in order to have a better direction in growth. For example: when we establish a company, there are a lot of things to worry about, some things which we have to face for the first time, But if there is a senior consultant, it helps more and less the company. However, we might not rely too much on the older human, we should absorb and think our own ways. Ċ Although, the old people don’t have much strength, in return, they have the mind. Being able to find the jobs which are right for them, then I think this is an abundant force of labour for the society. For instance: In Japan, the country has the proportion of older people in the world, but the government knows how to create employees for them such as teaching the Japanese language to foreigners or celebrate volunteer clubs. Nevertheless, The elderly should also learn some new knowledges to not backward with the young generation. Ċ In conclusion, every generation has its own advantages and disadvantages. Don’t distinguish each other. The old and young people need to complement and develop together."
9471,What's important in the growth of a person? After birth what will play a major role in one's personality and development. Nature or Nurture? Give reason for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is a controversial debate as to whether nature or nurture plays a vital role in the personality and development of an individual. I think that nurture is really important factor in judging the human perspective. I will elaborate in upcoming paragraphs to support my view point. Ċ Nourishment is an integral part in life of human beings. Even if the nature of a person is not good then it can become better by nurturing the goods habits in them. For example: if a plant is becoming wither then we can give back shinning life to plants by nourishing it with pesticides and water then it starts blossom again so is the same case with people. Moreover, it is generally seen that if a child has been adopted by other family and later on if anybody compares that child with the sibling then we hardly find any similarity between them due to the difference in upbringing of a child. Thus, it is the nurture which is important in development. Ċ Furthermore, various researches have evidenced that children emulate the footprints of their parents, whatever they will see in their family they will always follow the same way. Therefore, it is significant to act sagaciously in front of the kids otherwise it will ruin their life. Parenting is quite crucial if they will inculcate the good habits in their child then nature of the kids would definitely will become fantabulous on its own. Ċ All in all, I believe that nurturing is important in the growth of a person but indeed a difficult step to implement and parents need to act cautiously while developing their child."
9472,"The use of electronic media has a negative effect on personal relationships between people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?  Writing Task 2, Unit 4D, Page 28","Over the time, the emergence of sophisticated electronic media has bring many advantages for people around the world. Meanwhile, others think that the drawback can affect to our personal relationships with other people. I totally agree with the statement and I will discuss the reason in this essay. Ċ Firstly, there are several types of electronic media that people enjoy using it. One of them is smart phone. The reason is people can use not only for communicate, but also do other activities, such as business for shopping online or booking air ticket by only one click. According to the journal, experts have done some research about this phenomenon and found a result in 2015, people who opt shopping online by using smart phone than go from shop to shop, jumped to 76%. It is true that there is a significant increase in shopping online application that can be downloaded in mobile phone. Thus, the electric media usage make people convenient to use it. Ċ On the other hand, besides its outweigh for the user, it is able to give a negative influence and especially to our personal relationships with close people. Although the benefit can connect us to other people who live far away from us, our relationships with people surround us might be getting worse. For instance, many children use their gadget when they have a dinner with family. As result, they have lack of social life with real people than virtual friends. Thus, it can bring a bad effect on our relationships between people. Ċ Overall, I believe that people can get many benefits from electronic media due to its usage, eventhough the disadvantage may cause negative effect on our social life with surrounding people.

9473,Sports events such as Formula One and other car racing events should be banned because they are unnecessary waste of money and create more pollution. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Sporting events are incredibly popular throughout the world. Many are fanatic about these and literally wait to attend. At the same time, it is known to waste a lot of money and create enormous pollution than we already have. Although many argue that these events should be banned, I do not agree to prohibit them, but the authorities behind them should take additional responsibility to mitigate the impact caused. This essay will discuss why it is worth to have these sports ceremonies. Ċ To begin with, people travel from different countries to participate as well as to visit. Gathering to a venue from various nations on a sporting occasion is exuberating among the crowd. Because such occasions are platforms to mingle with various cultures, this has a lasting impact on people that is socially and culturally beneficial. Moreover, travelling on this occasion would increase the nation's economy. These temporary programs would offer a local business opportunity. For instance, American Economic Times magazine published the local employment growth rate during this period, and the numbers were spiking up over regular time; thus, though it seems to be a lot of wastage and highly expensive, the transactions in-turn aid in the rise of the country's economy. Ċ On the other hand, there is a significant factor to consider, i.e., the pollution caused by Formula One races can have a debilitating effect on the environment. The respective authorities have to own accountability for the benefit of all. Also, the sponsored vehicles should be as environmentally friendly as possible. Some automobile industries already started their research and development towards it, which is a positive note. For example, Mahindra motor vehicle company has demonstrated the less pollution racing cars as part of their phase 1 demo. They said further improvisations are in progress. Ċ To summarize, I disagree with prohibiting sporting events because of the social, cultural, and economic benefits. However, the government and the concerning officers should be more cautious to ensure the necessary safety."
9474,"Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?","It is commonly acknowledged that early impressions have a great impact on an individual’s life, yet many people argue about the age that has more significance on our future. While many believe that infancy is a more susceptible and noteworthy period, others dispute that impressions obtained during adolescence are of greater relevance. In this essay, I will try to investigate both viewpoints and provide a weighted consideration on the topic. Ċ To begin with, according to some people, the environment that surrounds us and the experiences we obtain at the early stages of our lives play a crucial part in the way our personality is formed. The reasoning behind this is rather straightforward: proponents of this viewpoint suggest that toddlers are known to absorb an enormous amount of information, and that indicates that even when they have not learnt to speak yet, they are already able to comprehend. Hence, any traumatic events during this period will affect the future course of their life. As to my opinion, I tend to agree with the above-mentioned arguments, and to support them I would like to provide an example of a commonly utilized psychiatric practice. When working with adults, psychiatrists are attempting to discover any profound traces of trauma experienced during infancy, and in severe ,cases they can even turn to hypnosis to try and uncover the memories that a person’s subconsciousness chose to erase. Ċ Conversely to this point of view, others claim that school years may have more repercussions on our future. To support this opinion, they emphasize that teenagers are particularly vulnerable as they are only starting to form their character, so any traumatic events like a divorce of their parents or disease of the loved ones may lead to them becoming anti-social and controversial. At the same time, if a child is encouraged and recognized during adolescence, he or she has higher chances of gaining confidence and being mentally stable. As much as I agree with this being a sensitive period, I adhere to the view that it is easier for teenagers because they can ask for the assistance they require, whereas toddlers cannot. To exemplify, if a child is being bullied at school, he or she may speak to their parents and ask to be sent to a different institution. Ċ To conclude, in light of the aforementioned arguments and examples, one should acknowledge that any age is relevant in forming an individual’s personality, although it is worth mentioning that the older a person gets, the more resilient and stable he or she becomes to the external events. For this reason, in my opinion, it is crucial to make sure that a toddler’s first impressions are not scarring."
9475,"Exam question : In the modern society, children are less reliant on their parents to learn about the surrounding world compared to families in the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Many people believe that modern society makes children dependent on their parents to learn about the world around them. Some think that children always need to depend on adults. I believe that children are less reliant on their parents to learn about the surrounding world compared to families in the past. Ċ Nowadays, children are always exposed to new things at a very young age. It is ordinary for a child about five years old to know how to use the internet to watch movies or play games. Knowing how to use the internet makes them less reliant on their parents to study and learn things all around the world. Most children nowadays are self-taught. When they don't understand a lesson, they rarely ask their teachers or parents, but they use the internet to find out. Ċ Because society is developing more and more, parents always have to work around the clock to make life better, which made parents have less time to teach their children. That is also the reason why children become more independent in their life. They can do simple household chores like cooking, doing laundry, or cleaning the house. Ċ In the past, because there were no electronic devices or the internet like now. So it is very difficult for children to have access to things around the world. That makes them always dependent on their parents in learning and understanding many things around them. Ċ To sum up, I believe that the development of society has made children more and more independent. They can live freely however they want without being a constraint."
9476,Many foods are shipped from far away. Some people think that eating local food is more beneficial both environmentally and economically. Do you think the advantages outweigh its disadvantages?,"Some individuals prefer to consume locally-produced foods instead of imported ones because of environmental and economic concern. In my opinion, some diets are required to bring from overseas as they are healthy to have. Ċ On the one hand, various imported foodstuff gives significant health benefits. Many overseas fruits, vegetables and processed meals are filled with vitamins and good additives, which are very much necessary for humans to supply nutritions in the body and maintain fitness. Moreover, some of these items can not be cultivated locally because of the unavailability of a suitable atmosphere and soil. Thus, purchasing such stuff from abroad can supply essential nourishments to the residents. For instance, avocado, which is a nutrient-dense fruit especially filled with a good fatty acid, not farmed in Bangladesh but people of this country buy it from overseas. Ċ In contrast, the shipment of food promotes environmental pollution and the expense of the locals. Usually, commodities are transported from abroad by the air, water and road; as a result, more fuels are burned and contaminated the atmosphere. Furthermore, consuming foreign foods are costly as the importers have to pay taxes and tariffs in the borders; these formalities raise the price of every single imported item. For example, Bangladeshi inhabitants have to pay more than double for foreign strawberry in the local market than to the locally produced one. However, diet shipments are pursued with the demands of the products; therefore, there is less chance of frequent freights and unnecessary intaken by the customers. Ċ In conclusion, getting foodstuff from outside of the country is advantageous or not is a controversial issue. Some people think that this trend drives climate pollution and expenditure. Nevertheless, I believe, it is worthwhile to eat these considering the essential compounds they contain."
9477,IELTS TASK 2 - TECHNOLOGY AND TRAVEL Topic: Internet technology means people do not need to travel to foregin countries to understand how others live. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is believed by some that people can easily apprehend oversea life with the development of internet and technology without traveling to those countries. While I agree that internet technology has several benefits in gaining knowledge about other countries, I would argue that traveling is more likely to be a practical method to completely experience foreign life. Ċ On the one hand, it is unquestionable that advance technology including internet has some sorts of imformation. Internet and technology development makes it more accessable to all the information that people want to know through available searching tools like Google. Therefore, it is easier for them to imagine the oversea life and cultures through documents like photos, videos and films. Moreover, internet provides people with all sources of available information with no cost, so they can save time and money but still can study about another local customs. Ċ However, I believe that travelling play a crucial role in order to acquire knowledge about different territories. It is obvious that the majority of internet information is all about the bright side of a country instead of the dark side; therefore, those untested information can not help people completely, fully learn about one different country like learning themselves by listening and seeing directly. Besides, destining to another king dom not only gains people's knowledge geographically but also aprehend and experience about their heritage which is not available on the internet. Thus, travelling is essential to know about oversea countries and their people. Ċ In conclusion, internet technology can give people information about some aspects of a different country but it can not compare with real experience through tourism"
9478,"With the increase in computer use, many people feel that school do not need to put the emphasis that they used to on basic handwriting skills or mathematics skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is often believed that with the excessive usage of computers in the student's life, the educational institution may ignore the basic skills of logical mathematics and handwriting which was compulsory for children in the previous days. I completely disagree with the statement and would elaborate on the views in the upcoming paragraphs. Ċ To commence with, schools cannot skip the basic skills of the students for various reasons. Firstly, it may weaken their mental ability. In other words, the math subject helps the students to improve their memory by doing the calculations and performing the various puzzles. Moreover, it increases the concentration power of pupil which plays a crucial rule in the overall development of the child. Though computers can do all the calculation, yet the process may make the child dumb. Secondly, technology would not stay forever with human but only mental ability. There are some situations where machines get failed and a person do not know calculation, at that spot of time the person considered to be illiterate one. Consequently, the mathematics is necessary at the schools. Ċ Furthermore, handwriting also plays a great role in pupil life. The handwriting showcase the personality and intelligence of the students. Not only this, it can even help those who are suffering from disabilities like ADD and Dyslexia. Additionally, people are dependent on soft documents and portable document files. Due to it, no one bothers about writing on the paper. With this, they start forgetting about grammar and spelling part of writing. The auto-suggestion facility of writing software making the people academically weak, because they do not bother about learning grammar and spelling which person can learn easily while writing with a pen or pencil. Therefore, basic knowledge of maths and writing is necessary during school period. Ċ To conclude, although the computer has numerous benefits yet it cannot beat the human brain. It is the only mental ability that helps them to operate the computers of writing and calculations. Hence these skills cannot be ignored in life."
9479,"People today can use the internet to learn about lives and cultures in other countries, so it is not necessary to travel anymore. Do you agree?","The Internet is the greatest invention of the 20th century. It is often argued that just by browsing through it , one can gain an understanding of other countries customs and traditions. I completely disagree with this opinion and think that human interaction is important in knowing people and its surrounding. Ċ First of all, travelling creates meaningful relationships. There's nothing better than the feeling of excitement of going to a new place, meeting the locals, and personally witnessing the way of life of the people around it. Things that couldn't be felt by just browsing online. For instance, watching Chinese families make dumplings in preparation for Lunar New Year online isn't comparable with the experience of a traveller who is in China and making it with the local Chinese family. Ċ Second, exploration of a new place gives more personal knowledge and understanding. Hence, it makes long-lasting memories. In addition, it also helps shape someone's personality and perspective in life. Moreover, not all information online is factual, therefore, it gives people wrong ideas. For example, due to the international media portrayal of China, many foreigners think that it is a secluded and outdated society when in fact, it's the entire opposite. For the past 13 years of me being in the country, I would testify how it had advanced technologically and slowly opened to the world over the years. Ċ In conclusion, I strongly believe that learning firsthand through travelling is necessary for knowing other countries lives and cultures because it's more worthwhile and meaningful."
9480,Some people think that young people are not suitable for important positions in governments of countries. Others argue that young people have new ideas in these positions. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"Recently, youngsters are increasingly popular in government sectors with important responsibilities. Some people assert that the younger generations are unsuitable for those positions since they tend to be less skilled. Nevertheless, other people perceive their creativity as beneficial in resolving the difficulties encountered by the government. Ċ There is no denying that the younger generations tend to behave in an impulsive and imprudent way to deal with controversial issues, and this is especially detrimental when it comes to handling pressing tasks in government departments. The major responsibilities for the administrative organs should be guaranteeing a harmonious society and tackling conflicts at the best interest of citizens. As distinct from the grew generation, youths are commonly perceived as inexperienced. Specifically, a lack of practical experience could result in a failure to perform their tasks efficiently, especially when they encounter unexpected events. This inevitably weakens the public image of the authority. In light of this, youths are not competent for the positions in governments. Ċ Nevertheless, young officials' superiorities in government departments could be justified. This is primarily due to their creativity and open-mindedness. It is widely recognized that the task in the authority could be extremely complicated and troublesome while the workload is overwhelming. However, youngsters are likely to tackle issues from different angles and demonstrate more tolerance to respect people from diverse racial and cultural backgrounds. This in turn instills vitality and momentum in the working environment, thereby facilitating their work efficiency. Ċ In brief, youngsters lack experience but have their advantages in addressing issues creatively. However, those significant positions in governments should be performed carefully by people with rich experience and down-to-earth attitude rather than job cookies like youths."
9481,The advances in air travel are focused only for the upper class and this seems to have left others with no benefit. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is sometimes debated that advances in air travel only bring benefits to the upper class, and this industry tends to ignore the benefits of others. While I agree with this statement, I believe that the advances in air travel can help poor people. Ċ On the one hand, the advances in air travel lead to drawbacks for poor people. Firstly, the aviation industry is associated with the tiredness of low-income people. To be more specific, poor people who want to go to an airplane have to queue, while rich people can gain support from airplane companies with a private path for VIP guests. Therefore, this trend helps rich people to save a lot of time and energy. Secondly, the aviation industry plays a key role in protecting the health of rich people. Nowadays, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly has spread all over the world, and rich people tend to use private jets to avoid contact with this dangerous disease. In contrast, poor people tend to travel by low-cost flights, which is more likely to suffer from the COVID-19 virus. Ċ On the other hand, advances in air travel bring benefits to poor people. Apparently, using aviation services has positive impacts on saving time for low-income people. Undoubtedly, commuting by airplane can be considered the safest and fastest way in the world, and airline companies pay attention to cutting ticket fares to hook low-income people. Therefore, low-income people can take advantage of this trend to travel by planes, which helps them to save a lot of time. Ċ In conclusion, air travel is responsible for the drawbacks of poor people; however, this development also results in benefits for them."
9482,"Q: Some educationists argue that non-exam, arts-based subjects such as music, drama, art, and craft should be compulsory in the secondary-school curriculum. They believe that activities such as these can improve overall academic performance.","Secondary-school is the crucial stage amidst all educational phases. On account of this, some educationalists argue that non-exam, arts-based subjects included music, drama, art and craft should be considered in the curriculum to enhance their academic performance. Personally, I firmly agree with this statement thanks to pupils' brain-balancing and their broaden horizon. Ċ Arts-besed classes are be able to improve overall academic rate for the students. This is because these core competences is not as difficult as the exam-based subjects like math, english, and so on. This statement is parallel with the contemporary study conducted by the University of Queensland in 2015. They found that 87% school that applying this methode could obtain their grade by students achievement in the national olympiad nearly twofold than the preciding year. Thus clear that, such arts subjects can lead the overall rank become better. Ċ In addition, arts disciplines will useful for the pupils to balance their right-and-left-side brian. As such, all kind of arts is the job for the right hemisfer while the other logic-subjects is the left-brain's task. What is more, these kind of competences will expand their knowledge. The more insight that are given to the students, the wider opportunity they will broaden their horizon. Ċ The aforementioned evidence shows that there are a large number of merits are be able attained by the secondary-school students by studying arts disciplines including to increase academic grade, balancing brain's performnce, and obtaining a wider knowladge. On account of this, I highly likely suggest to the related stakeholder to consider it as a compulsory subject in secondary-school curriculum."
9483,Nowadays getting a job is becoming harder in poor countries leading to a rise in unemployment. Some people believe that pupils should only be allowed to access primary education while others believe that secondary education is necessary. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Increasing population has become a major problem resulting in unemployment in many sectors of developing and under-developed countries. Higher Studies is a need of an hour but some people still think that primary education would suffice. I agree with the former view which would be discussed in my essay. Ċ To begin with, growing competition and demands has led many people jobless. Firstly, many organisations have set the criteria of minimum qualification of being graduate due to which pupils cannot apply for those opportunities. For instance, many multi-national companies take entrance tests and checks if an individual is meeting the minimum requirement. Secondly, technological advancements in industries have decreased the labour-intensive work which results in masses to be unemployed. Thus, people are struggling in finding jobs with only primary education. Ċ Moreover, there are certain challenges faced by the public in terms of gaining the qualification. As people who are not much educated, have to face the financial crisis because they will not be getting enough wages in low standard jobs. Plus, most of the work driven by humans have been taken up by machines for which skilled workers are needed. For example, earlier labour was required in industries like cotton and sugar mills which has been replaced with heavy and expensive machinery. Hence, getting paid in today's era has become a crucial task and there is no value of un-edu2cated or less educated pupils. Ċ In conclusion, there is a lot of competition and struggle in finding an appropriate career especially in developing countries where an unemployment rate is very high. I strongly support the folks who opine that higher studies are essential."
9484,"some people like to try new things, for example, places to visit and types of food. Other people prefer to keep doing things they are familiar with. Ċ Discuss both these attitudes and give your own opinion.","It is believed that experiencing new things give a sense of excitement and delight, hence, some people always try different locations and taste food whereas another group entirely disagree and persist in following repetitive and monotonous things. I go along with the former group and in this essay, both notions will be discussed. Ċ On the one hand, there are still some people who are keen on finding and exploring creative methods and novel things such as delicious cuisine of other countries, wonderful places and so on. In their view, new experiences expand their horizon and give them insight into other native lands' ideas. In addition, the main benefit of this point of view is that they reach a common understanding and get familiar with a wide range of diverse cultures, traditions and beliefs. By way of example, travelling to different places give them much historical information about lifestyles. Therefore I strongly agree with this idea. Ċ On the other hand, another group do not summon the courage to replace their internalize beliefs with a new one. Furthermore, they are kind of being conservative and conventional. For instance, new dishes pose a danger to their health. What’s more, since basically, new places might come with unforeseen problems and probably feel insecure, thus, they prefer not to go there and maintain peacefulness. Ċ In my perspective, human nature requires a refreshment change to their ideas. Likewise, diversity can broaden their mind and open a new world ahead of them in order to have something in their mind. Ċ To sum up, in my point of view, although everything in the world cannot suit all our tastes, new experiences like food, places and so on not only helps us to become more sociable but also encourage us to adjust to a new lifestyle and adapt to any situations. Moreover, enhance their relations and live at peace with all people."
9485,"""It i better to marry someone who is similar to you rather than who is different from you. Give reasons for your choice.""","Marriages are made in heaven. This phrase is most commonly used by everyone at the time of discussion about the marriages. Some believes that marrying a person similar to you in nature would built successful relationship between them. While other believes that opposite attracts each other and complete each other, therefore make a happy and healthy relationship between them. In my opinion, the former view of similar nature would be the key of successful marriage. Ċ First, similar nature would result in less conflicts and arguments between a couple. For instance, if a couple would like to purchase home then they would make certain crirteria for their choice. And if,there choices are similar then they would agree with same option with no compromises. Moreover, they save time of discussion about each other other opinion. Ċ Second, their would be better understanding between couple. In a similar nature marriages each person would understand others opinion at the time of decision making. For example, me and my husband, both have the habit to watch television with the lights off. We think that its give better impact while watching. Therefore, we understand each other feelings and follow the same choice. This makes us live more comfortably with each other. Ċ In addition to this, similar nature results in better handling of future situation. In such marriages person can assume about others opinion for particular instance. Very simply, I can assume that if I ask my husband for dinner tonight then he will definatly say yes to me. Furthermore, their would be more chances to predict situation. Ċ All in all, if someone marry with a person of same interest then they would live more comfortably with less arguments. Furthermore, they can predict about each other nature in more proper manner and understand each other."
9486,"Scientists say we eat too much junk food and that is harmful to our health. Some people believe the answer to this question lies with education, but others argue education is useless. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Experts believe that junk food consumption highly is bad for our body. Few people argue that education can be one of solutions to avoid them of it, whereas other think contrarily, it is not important to reduce the number of junk food consumer. This essay will discuss both points of view. Ċ With regard to education in harmful junk food, people are provided to know how the food cannot be processed as fast as other food, it leads to people protecting their selves to eat too much junk food. Furthermore, it is believed by some that junk food is produced with chemical foodstuffs, which is danger for their body. Substances carcinogen in pizza junk food for example, it gives rise to cancer for them who eat the food. As a result, knowledge about it can fight them off eating junk food. Ċ However, I do not believe these arguments stand up to scrutiny, the first reason is that junk food is easy to obtain in our environment, it has been enormous producing over the last decades. Secondly, it has provided really delicious taste, so few of them can make a stand their mouth to consume the food, even they do not have more time to prepare their healthy food at home. Finally, it has also been proven that education cannot effect people to eat junk food. Plenty of them really have knowledge about drawbacks of junk food, while they cannot avoid their habit to eat it. Therefore, aware of health is needed to be able keeping off to eat the food. Ċ To sum up, although some people think that education is useful for avoiding junk food, I would argue that they cannot have healthy lifestyle if they are not really caring with their body."
9487,Some people think that there are things individuals can do to help Ċ prevent global climate change. Others believe that action by individuals is useless and irrelevant and that it is only governments and large businesses which can make a difference. Ċ Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"While some people believe that certain imperative actions could be taken by the individuals to cope-up with these issues, others argue that the responsibility solely falls on the administrative authorities as our efforts are insignificant. In my opinion, the government and people have to share the burden to overcome this serious issue. The following script will discuss both the views and shall present the reasons for my argument. Ċ We as inhabitants of this world hold the responsibility of saving it as well. For this, certain crucial steps are inevitable to be taken by the individuals against this climate change pandemic. Which means that we must play our part towards saving our planet in every possible way, for example, by planting the trees, recycling garbage and avoiding plastic products which need to be disposed of by burning. Such constructive measures would definitely be helpful towards saving nature by mitigating the pollutants and other causes for it. Hence, each one of us has to play a role in it. Ċ On the other hand, the advocates of the other side say that our struggles and contributions towards this issue are not justified; instead, the government should come forward to serve. Which is to say that we have no idea how to mitigate the contributing factors and we need proper guidance before working on it. Therefore, the legislator bodies should come up with the solutions, for instance, by banning the plastic bags, preventing cutting the trees and also supporting the campaigns to promote tree plantation. However, any of these steps is not implementable without our help. Ċ To conclude, although there is a two-way opinion on whether the individuals should contribute their effort towards climate change or the government should be held responsible. I propose that both of us, the administrative authorities and the people should come hand-in-hand to cope up with this widespread problem of climate change."
9488,"In countries like Japan, the population is getting older, are the effects of aging population on society is negative or positive. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The advancement in technology improved the life expectancy of people. As a result, the number of old age people is significantly increased. These aged population, has both positive and negative impacts on society. I feel it has more adverse effect than positive impacts. Ċ To begin with, graying population can be detrimental to the society as a whole, with its impacts on health care, labor market, economic productivity and on taxation. Firstly, there may not be enough people to work. The economy may be less productive and the government may bring foreign workers. Secondly, employed senior citizens may lead to unemployment to the young generation. Thirdly, there will not be enough young people to look after the aged people. They might have to move old age homes. Ċ An another point is that, elder people don't buy many anythings or to spend a lot of money. This also will reduce the economic growth. Lastly, the financial burden of the Government will surge. They may allocate more money for pension payment, medical allowances, maintaining old age homes and other concessions for senior citizens. They cannot earn lot and less tax return. All these, badly effects the society. Ċ However, not all effects have to be negative. There are some advantages in having lots of experience in life and work. Moreover, some are extremely wise and experienced to take the responsibility to govern an important institution or even a country and lead to prosperity. Additionally, elder people can teach their grand children well. They drive carefully, may reduce the road accidents, not steal or fight, diminish conflicts, and will be less competition for jobs or other needs. Ċ In conclusion, we should appreciate the beauty and potential of the youth and the advice and experience of the old. However, a society with young generation will progress fast."
9489,people eat more processed food than they did in the past.why is this?what are the effects of this?,"People consume the bigger amount of processed meal now than they used to do in the past. This happens due to the busy lifestyle and high prices for fresh products. This essay will take a look at the main reasons, why it happens, and the effects, which processed feed has. Ċ Nowadays life is extremely fast. Therefore, people have less time to prepare fresh feed than they did have earlier. This leads community to buy and consume products, which are already ready to be eaten. Another crucial factor is money. Now the prices of processed cuisine, especially taking in consideration unhealthy options, are low compared to previous years. This fact makes it more adorable for customers. As a result, more processed food is consumed now. The prime examples are the local shops, which mostly sell prepared to eat food (for instance, fast food), and have a big income. Ċ All these reasons lead to the significantly bad effects. The first thing to mention is an obesity around the humans, that has become obvious. Processed meal, such as sweet snacks and bars, makes people immediately gain weight. The second thing is health diseases. It means that nowadays people are more likely to have problems with the heart and stomach. These diseases are caused by junk, processed snack and bad eating habits. Ċ In conclusion, nowadays processed meal has become popular around customers. But unfortunately, consuming a huge number of processed meal has the remarkably negative effects on human beings, such as health troubles and overweight issues."
9490,"In some countries, people are now getting married at a later age than they did thirty years ago. What are the main reasons for this change, and what effects might it have on society.","Nowadays, people are inclined to get married at an older age compared to three decades before in certain nations. This essay will express the main causes for this tendency and then will show some influences of late marriage on society. Ċ To begin with, the main factor for the tendency that many people are reluctant to marry when they are young can be because more people pursue their academic status or career. Not only men but also women are apt to seek their degree compared to three decades ago. A case in point here is that the proportion of both genders in a prominent university in Japan is almost the same, which is greatly different from the past when women are a minority in academia. Therefore It can be natural that women with college degrees pursue their careers and tend to choose work than get eternal partners because when women get married, they may be expected by men to focus on household chores or raring children. Ċ Turning to the impacts that later marriage might have on society, one of the positive points is that it may be beneficial to the economy in the country. This is because when females focus on jobs instead of a wedding, the number of workers should increase, which results in more government tax revenue and stimulants of the economy. On the other hand, there are also downsides. One of the disadvantages is that the birth rate may be declining. When a couple gets older, it should be difficult for them to have offspring due to economic or physical reasons. In fact, the medical evidence shows that the older women become the higher possibilities their baby is born with disabilities. Ċ In conclusion, in several countries, increasingly people are unwilling to marry in juvenile because of the advancement of women. In addition, this trend has both negative and positive effects on society."
9491,IELTS WRITING_ TASK 2: Fashion trends. Task 2: Young people are now spending more and more time and money following fashion trends. What is your opinion? Is this a positive or negative development?,"These days, it is true that young generations are splashing out and devoting too much time to keep up with the latest fashion trends. From my perspective, this trend could have both positive and negative consequences in equal measure. Ċ On the one hand, there are several reasons why following chic items would be a positive aspect. First of all, teenagers are considered fashion to be a tool to define themselves. This is because many stylish and up-to-date clothes convey a lot of their personalities, tastes, and lifestyles. Hence, experimenting with new fashion trends enables the youth to try out different styles and make their appearance more distinguished. Another significant benefit is boosting their self-confidence. Young people who keep up with what is in vogue might get a lot of attention from their peers and like-minded people, compared to those who are outdated. Also, with a great sense of clothing, they could have a high chance to make good first impressions with others as well. Ċ On the other hand, the demerits of this tendency should never be ignored, and the main one is that the strong desire to stimulates overconsumption. By engrossing in high-items, young people must squander their time and money on shopping or searching for trendy clothes in magazines. As a result, they may neglect other important things such as studies, works, or even personal relationships. Another unfavorable effect of this trend is that it may drive young people to the edge of bankruptcy. If the world of fashion is always changing, more and more teenagers are willing to pour money into luxurious items. Things can even become worse, especially when unexpected things occur, such as accidents, or when the need to pay for tuition fees arises. Ċ In conclusion, although following fashion trends would be beneficial to some extent, I strongly believe that this can contribute to some drawbacks."
9492,"Some people believe that having too many TV channels is good for people, while some other pole believe that it only brings some poor quality TV programs. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There is currently a contentious argument over the beneficial purposes of TV programs. In my perspective, I quite believe that it depends on the way that people use this kind of social media. In this essay, I am going to analyze potential preferences for both sides of this issue and my opinion. Ċ On the one hand, it is undeniable that watching TV programs has huge merit for almost all residents. In other words, it is likely to do not only widen their horizons but also help them keep up to date with breaking national and worldwide news. Taking the Covid-19 pandemic as an example. Thanks to this media, citizens could update about the danger of this virus through a significant increase in mortality rate around the world. People, therefore, are aimed to know how to protect themselves and their relatives in both physical and mental health from this disaster. Moreover, a TV program is one of the best ways for entertainment. People could release stress after daily high-pressure work by watching TV with their families. Ċ On the other hand, some TV channels are bringing drawbacks. What I mean by this is that people, especially children, could be negatively affected by poor quality channels. For instance, movies in which have several violent and sexual scenarios are more likely to create bad habits for adolescents by the time their consciousnesses are flaws. Their awareness, as a result, could develop in wrong ways which lead to worse generations in upcoming years. Ċ In the conclusion, both views inevitably have their supporting evidence. I quite believe that the effects of TV programs are different among people, both good or bad ways."
9493,"Some people think the technology makes life complex, so we should make the life simpler without using the technology. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, the technology develops very fast, so there is a fair amount of people think that the automation which makes their activity more complicated. The residents can live without the automation to make the life more comfortable. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this dilemma. This essay is going to discuss why I have this opinion. Ċ On the one hand, I understand why there is a group of people who agree with the argument. Firstly, they do not feel comfortable with the automation or the modern devices such as a laptop or a smart phone which are too complicated for them. For instance, senior citizens who have a limitation to learn and remember a new thing. Additionally, there is another group who does not willing to accept the change will find it difficult to learn a new technology. Consequently, they will think the machinery is complex and make their activity harder. Ċ On the other one, there are several reasons that encourage me to totally disagree with the argument. Firstly, it makes our lives, even simpler, such as an instant communication via a cell phone or any chat messenger. Furthermore, people will not get lost while travelling to an unfamiliar country because they can use Google Maps or other software to support navigation. Therefore, instead of removing the technology from the world, we should take advantage from them to create an easier life. Ċ In conclusion, while so many people think the machinery which leads them to the complication should be reduced, I completely with that and do believe that the machinery brings more the comfort to our life and this should be accepted."
9494,"TASK 2 In recent times, many people are making the decision to live alone. What are the causes of this? Does it have positive or negatives effects on society?","In this modern era, while ordinary people live together with their relatives or partners, fractional of them have a tendency to live alone. Business in the workplace and bad experience in the past become main reason why people prefer to live lonely. However, I personally argue that this phenomenon has two sides both positive and negative. Ċ There are two principal factors which affect people to stay without life companion. The first reason is that they want to attain high position in the career. Those believe that living without family makes them to focus on their target. Besides, another cause why people take into account to survive lonely is that they experienced unpleasant moment when they lived with partners. Hence, they decide to spend their rest of live alone. Ċ With regards to the effect of this condition both positive and negative sides the benefit is that those mobilise all of their time and resources to reach their dream. They do not have any responsible to feed the member of family. Therefore, they can accomplish their aim effectively. Yet, this situation also has detrimental impact. If numerous people live lonely without wife, the population of human will decrease significantly. As a result, it will lead to economic crisis due to lack of demand toward goods and services. Ċ To sum up, it is evident that there are several causes of living without companion amidst some citizens, while it has also between advantage and disadvantage. In my point of view, people can determine which one the best choice for them, whatever lonely or establishing a family. However, I suggest to people to spend the rest of their life with someone he love."
9495,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People today spend too much time on enjoying themselves rather than working. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"My opinion to this statement is negative though it seems that people spend more time on enjoying themselves and less time on the things they should do such as their work or study, because we can see most people today wherever they go they often pick out their mobile phones and read interesting news on it. I have totally different views to that according to the following argument. Ċ People must struggle to improve their competence to elevate the levels of their livelihood in the high-speed developing world, or they will just live in the circumstance of surviving. It is all known that we are now living in an information world pursuing efficiency of production. In most condition people who have the relatively higher level of education as well as are with special skills can get a fairly good job. To the best of my knowledge, there are few job requiring worktime less than eight hours per day, normally from 9am to 5pm. Particularly for the jobs such as researcher and doctors, they often take over ten-hour work a day. I don't believe the normal worktime in the past time can exceed that in today. Ċ What's more, the statement fails to take into account that students spend more time today than ever on studying diversity of subjects. We can learn from the history of science that the amount of the current knowledge of human beings is immense to that of ancient time as ocean is to pond. Students have to exert themselves to handle what they learn as to get into reality what they have in mind. Consequently, it will not be strange to see students study more than ten hours a day. Ċ In conclusion, people today spend as much time as or even more than before. We cannot simply come into a conclusion by the appearance that people create and take part in a lot more manners of entertainments."
9496,TOEFL :  Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. Health is Wealth,"I have heard it many times that 'Health is Wealth'. There is nothing more important than your own health. So I would prefer that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Ċ Regular exercise will provide relaxation to mind and body. Students generally will not study continuously. So after certain time they need refre--shment. Physical exercise will take their mind away from study for moments. This will eventually result in relaxation of mind and body. Ċ Besides exercising regularly student will be healthy. Regular exercise also could be a game such as football, hockey, cricket and judo karate. Playing these games will make their bones and muscles stronger. Moreover playing these they will generate interest in sports as well. Some of the students may take one of the game as their career. Ċ It will generate bilateral thinking in students. Students doing both that is study and regular exercise will generate dual thinking. They will be able to think in either way around. So overall development of a student will be achieved. They will be sharp in studies as well as in other activities. Ċ Considering these many advantages i would prefer that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day."
9497,"Young people today spend too much money and time following fashion trends (clothing, tech) .To what extent do you agree or disagree?","One of the basic needs of humans, i.e., clothes have now become a way to flaunt high status in society. Also, the development in science, which is mainly essential to ease and support various tasks, is now the symbol of high class for teenagers. I completely agree that our youth is wasting unnecessary time and money to buy expensive clothes and electronic equipment. Ċ Nowadays, almost every child has a role model who is a celebrity and they tend to follow their style and fashion, which would be costlier to attain at a young age. Highly influenced by these famous personalities, youngsters try to follow in their footsteps to gain fame and status by buying expensive items such as clothes, watches, and smartphones. Thus, mostly to show off in front of their peers they spend either all of their pocket money or their whole salary. Eventually, this could lead to some serious financial problems in the future. Ċ In addition to this, youth is highly inclined towards creating an impressive image of themselves on social media that kills most of their leisure time, or sometimes a part of their productive time too. In a recent survey conducted by The Youth Timeline, it has been found that most scholars and undergraduates spend an average of 11 hours on social networking sites like Instagram, Facebook. Remarkably, this is almost half a day. Moreover, using their overpriced gadget continuously for long hours causes the prevalence of a plethora of health issues like back pain, weak eye-sight, and migraine among teenagers. Ċ To conclude, there is no doubt that youngsters waste a huge amount of money and their time to stay updated in terms of fashion and technology. Nonetheless, they should be encouraged by their guardians to concentrate more on productive activities and to save money."
9498,Rich countries should allow jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees who are from poor countries. Do you agree or disagree? allowing employment for poor countries workers,"A discussion has been presented regarding the talented workers from the third world countries should be employed in affluent part of the world. This employment contributes in reducing the poverty as either an accepted or an unaccepted issue in the modern age. In this essay, I will be discussing the reasons as to why I am in strong agreement with this proposal. Ċ Creating employment opportunities in developed nations for qualified worker, who live in under developed regions, are one of effective ways to help their country economy. When the workers are employed in the developed areas, they will able to spend more on their families who live in their home countries. Ultimately, their earnings become a remittance of their countries. Such increase in national revenues leads a growth in economy. Henceforth, such employment in wealthy areas must be bringing affluence for the less privilege regions. Ċ In addition, allowing the kind of employments is also convenient in terms of cost for foreign employers. By such employment, they can avoid the conducting training, which are mostly time-intensive. It implies that when affluent parts of the world offer employment for skilled workers of poor nations, they can make the reduction of cost in certain segments, giving the rise to the gross profit of their corporations. Eventually, an increase in the profit in any corporation contributes in the country economy. Ċ To conclude, it is evident that hiring workers from deprived nations also plays a pivotal role in boosting the poor economy. However, it also works for sustainable economic growth for the blooming nations. In this regards, I totally agree that the knowledgeable workers of undeveloped countries should be more employed by advanced countries."
9499,"Some people believe that the best way to succeed in life is to get a university education, while others disagree and say that it is no longer true nowadays. Discuss both views and give your own opinions.","In recent years, people's idea towards university education has been changing, and nowadays, many of them think that having high study is not the only way of succeeding. Vice versa, some individuals believe in an educational institution degree. In this essay, I will discuss both views. However, in my opinion, higher schooling is more imperative. Ċ The first group does not agree with getting a university study is not vital, believes that many apprenticeship courses lead us to work and learn. Therefore, students or other young folks can participate in and in three or four years later, they will have been a professional. For example, the government provides some practical programs for students in the hospital to work there without previous experience and they have this chance to learn the job and earn a living wage. Furthermore, they present this idea of taking technical or handcraft courses after school. Because young community can learn new viable and worthwhile skills through these classes and receive certification and experiences for their resume. For instance, folks can take carpentry classes. Then, they will learn a new skill and have a good resume for their jobs. Ċ On the other hand, the people who say an academic institution degree is still a high priority, have this notion that individuals highly educated, have better job opportunities. Since they have an academic institution certification they have this chance to enter valued and famous firms. For exemplify, a person who graduated in geology can find jobs as an analyzer or expert or in NASA or USGS company in the US. Moreover, they state that these young people see the work-life in a higher position and opposite their grandparents have no interest in vocation schooling. Hence, they have a plan to become managers and get promotions in the company. Because of that, they need to pass higher education. To illustrate, if a person wants to be a manager of a company that produced computers, he should have a university grade. Ċ In conclusion, although there are a few beneficial factors for not having an education degree, society needs to educate folks and post-graduate citizens for extended researchers and higher managing positions. And In my view, despite the fact that a city needs all kinds of jobs, having this grade is highly recommended."
9500,The key to solving environmental problems is for the present generation to sacrifice their convenient way of life for the sake of future generations. Ċ Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"These days the environmental issue is at the top of the agenda. Some people suppose the only way to resolve it is to refuse from the present style of living in the interest of future generations. I’m devoting this essay to reasoning why this idea is not deprived of rationality. Ċ To start with, the natural aspiration of people is to leave posterity and therefore, to create the best conditions for surviving. This is why I suppose making changes is a logical, reasonable, and, what is especially important, inevitable development for an animal with the highest level of organisation that man is. For instance, so-called plastic pollution is an especially actual question. These days microplastic contains in drinking water, food and even air. According to Italian research, its pigmented particles were found in both fetal and maternal human placenta out. Despite the fact the exact health risk posed by plastic remains controversial and not yet fully understood, there are studies demonstrating undesirable influence upon the human endocrine system, provoked by such a plastic component as BPA (bisphenol A). If its impact is not overrated, humanity seems to be in big trouble. Ċ Besides, not only are the products of human activity toxic but, they also depend on finite resources. The present level of consumption is unsustainable due to the limitation of raw materials. For example, it is predicted that fossil fuels will have run out by the end of the century. Oil can last up to 50 years, natural gas up to 53 years. It follows that if the consumption and production do not reduce, the following generations will be left in the lurch. Ċ To sum up, in my belief, people of the 21st century must give up their comfortable lifestyle for the sake of progeny."
9501,"Some people believe that elderly employees are more useful to a company, while others believe that young employees are better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There is no doubt that the workforce is very crucial in any organization across the world. However, while some believe that the younger generations are better for a company, I would agree with those who argue that experienced candidates are the key to organizational growth. Ċ On the one hand, it is vital that companies equip their campus with young associates who are usually sharp and enthusiastic. This is because these sets of people are up-to-date with the latest technologies and best skill set which are key requirements in today's world. For instance, a start-up in Bangalore recruited only early professionals, thus increasing its productivity and rise in market value. In contrast, if they completely depend on elderly employees, then there might be several impacts on the progress which in turn impacts the profit. Ċ On the other hand, my view is that having experienced candidates will surely be advantageous to the organization. The reason for this is that they acquire great experiences with an enormous amount of knowledge across different products, and research has shown that experience is a necessary catalyst for the drive and success of any industry. For instance, elderly mentor-ship by Steve jobs is the main reason for the development of Apple. As a result, older candidates are the key players who are very crucial for companies betterment than in comparison to less experienced people. Ċ In conclusion, although it is of critical importance that IT industries should continue to hire fresh grads who can contribute with their smartness, it is my firm belief that experienced people can lay a better foundation for the progress on the basis that this will give drastic results."
9502,Some people say that teenagers should work part-time and earn money. This way they will learn basic lessons about work and become more disciplined. Others argue that teenagers shouldn't sacrifice their rest and after-school activities to work. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is true that the question of whether juveniles are in need of undertaking a partial job or feel at ease and join other activities remains a source of controversy. While many people believe that the youth should become more self-controlled thanks to after-school jobs, I would argue that focusing on necessary facets for their academic work is much better. Ċ There are many plus points for taking a part-time job as a teenager. Firstly, it is in the workplace environment that young adults could gain invaluable experience which could not get at school. Those could be self-discipline or flexibility, which is likely to lay for the students a firm foundation of work-related perception afterwards. Secondly, having a job means that the adolescents are able to make their own extra money on monthly basis, and this money could be paid for what they call for. As a result, the youngsters would mitigate the state of a severe shortage of parental financial support. Ċ On the other hand, I believe that having time for activities after school or just relax is better in some ways. One of the merits is that in general, the more they focus on schoolwork, the better results they get. For example, there are many clubs that do not only give a chance for their members to have fun but also assist them with how to put theoretical lessons into practice. This, in return, is a precious asset for them in the long run. In addition, many pieces of research show that it is of this age group that could develop physical traits, such as height, weight in an effective way. This means that teenagers should frequently spend time working out to live a healthy and balanced life. Ċ In conclusion, it seems to me that at their age, learning is the ultimate goal that teenagers all need to achieve. Therefore, they should not let themselves be tempted into money and ignore their study duty."
9503,"The debate on cash versus credit card has been going on for some time. Credit is still a fairly new concept within the history of finance; so many people would rather stick with paper money. Ċ According to you, which is a better payment method, cash or credit? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","With the implementation of demonetisation, payment methods became a hot topic of discussion. While some side towards credit cards, many people still prefer to stay with cash citing the reason that credit is still a newer concept in the long history of finance. This essay elaborates on why I feel that credit cards are a preferred payment method as compared to physical currency. Ċ To begin with, there are definite advantages to the virtual exchange of money. Firstly, there is no need to carry rupee notes in your wallet and just a card is sufficient. Secondly, there is a limit to the amount of cash that one can practically carry with himself, a drawback not faced by virtual money. For example, when I visited the Apple store to buy a phone which costs 150,000 rupees, it would have been mighty inconvenient to carry this large amount in cash. But as I had a credit card, I could travel with a lighter pocket. Ċ Moreover, cash also has some inherent disadvantages. First of all, cash transactions happen off-paper, without leaving any trail. Thus, paper money can be used as a source of corruption and bribery. For instance, I was once asked a bribe of Rupees 500 by a traffic policeman as I had forgotten to carry my driving licence. Ċ In conclusion, due to the advantages like convenience and safety offered by the credit card and the drawbacks associated with cash such as fake currency and bribery, I believe that virtual payments are superior to physical notes."
9504,"""Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.""","An institution is just that, an institution -- ran by money, to make money. An education is a life choice; be it sought by recent high school graduates, or those latter life individuals in the pursuit for fulfillment. An educational institution's purpose is to educate, not to arbitrarily cast judgment upon individuals who they deem unfit. Ċ To cast a wide net of un-hasty generalization, no one likes to be told they're not capable of success. At any educational institution, you'll find academic advisors. Each and every one of those advisors salaries is paid in part per student tuition. Should a student pay money to pursue their passion? Or should they pay money, to have someone tell them that they can't? Dissuasion would be nothing short of an uneven exchange. Ċ In business, the consumer is always right. So why would an educational institution -- a business -- get granted the right to tell the student -- the consumer -- what's right for them? It's simple, veiled self-fulfillment. To establish the sought after prestige and perception of academic grandeur, institutions seek to maximize student potential. That doesn't sound so bad, right? Wrong. As paying students, their hands should be guided, not forced. Ċ However, if institutions are paying students; either through specific field-based scholarships or grants, those students should be expected to perform according to the standards in which they were granted. In both cases -- student paid, or institution paid -- the payee shan't shortchange the hand that feeds. Ċ In sum, educational institutions should stick to what their name implies. Hindering goals and pursuits of those attending them needn't be a part. Doing so, is a testament of creative shortsightedness on the educators behalf, and a pitfall for paying students."
9505,Mobile phones have made life easier:any one can use a mobile phone to answer work calls or home calls at any place 7 days a week.Do you this this development has more positive effects or negative effects on the individuals and society?,"In the past few decades,technology has been promoted rapidly in society. It is believed that smartphones have changed our lifestyles.People can get access to phone calls whenever and wherever they want. In my opinion,the drawbacks outweigh the benefits. Ċ Admittedly, mobile contact bring out considerable convenience to our lives.For example,nowadays,individuals are used to replying to emails and office calls via dial,which ensures they would not miss information and demand from clients.In addition,cell contact is beneficial to maintain constant contact with families and friends,particularly for those living overseas.Therefore,it makes great contributions to globalization for society. Ċ On the other hand,the overuse of this electronic device is detrimental to people's health and leads to an imbalance between work and personal life.For instance,quite a number of teenagers are addicted to mobile for entertainment,which causes many adolescents to get myopia.Moreover, workers are faced with unlimited work even after their working time.Thus,the damage of this can not be ignored. Ċ Besides,too much dependence on smartphones might result in some social issues,such as depression and a lack of communication skills.For example,people are more likely to talk to their friends through phones rather than meeting their friends.Their communication skills worsen over time .After that,they tend to be more isolated and more stressed. Hence,it might alienate individuals and create some health problems physically and mentally among the whole nation. Ċ In conclusion,although there are tremendous positive effects on the use of mobile ,the numerous demerits have a negative impact on individuals and civilization .I believe that it should be used under control."
9506,"In some countries, criminal trials in law court are telecasted on Television for public. Do you think advantages of this outweigh its disadvantages?","In a world of the media,there is increasing variations of television shows. Some people believe that the broadcasting from court might pose a negative effect on the audience. However, in my opinion, modern society has to understand the principles how legal system works. Ċ To begin with, one of the argument against might be that the offenders have become a sort of celebrities in eyes of youth. While children have access to the internet and allied resources, they may able to adopt unappropriated behavior from the heroes in the television shows about the court's trials. For instance, there is a widely popular video in Youtube, where a girl demonstrates such attitude toward a judge. However, it educates them as well about dire consequences which follow after this type of behavior. Hence, the effectiveness of broadcasting from a court can be necessary. Ċ Apart from the promotion of the correct way to conduct, an ordinary people can also comprehend an entire prosecution process by watching a trial in television, and therefore be aware of his legal rights. Some people do not have knowledge how to behave with the police, and so through learning the basic of law, they would be benefited. An example of this is my youngest brother, He likes to watch real telecasting from a court as it explains the reasons behind each sentence. As a result, he is now able to protect himself in case of a criminal bias. Thus, the positive aspect can be viewed in regard to broadcasting from a court. Ċ To sum up, although there appears to be an argument against television broadcasting of trials on the basis of promotion wrong types of behaviors,I firmly believe that this phenomenon brings tremendous benefits in terms of education purposes.Therefore, It is hoped that a similar strategy will be put into action in other countries as well."
9507,Nowadays there is an increase in social problems involving young people because more parents spent time at work than with their children. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"Over the past few decades, the rate of juvenile delinquency has surged drastically. Some claim that this problem has occurred because parents neglect their children. I partially agree with this statement as parents are not solely accountable for this matter. This essay will discuss the potential factors which contribute towards societal issues. Ċ To begin with, nowadays parents work hard to meet the ends of the family due to the constantly changing socioeconomic conditions, and cannot keep a deliberate watch on their children. During the early phase of life, children require great care and vigilance and its absence can adversely affect their lives. Furthermore, they fall prey to bad company and are prone to develop odd habits like drug abuse, alcohol consumption. There is a host of recorded instances where children become drug addicts due to parent negligence. These instances have bolstered the notion that parents do not spend enough time with their children which significantly contributes in social problems. Ċ Although parental ignorance is to some extent is responsible for social issues, poverty is the main detriment which denotes towards this matter. A growing number of people, including me, believe that poverty is the prime reason for the tremendous increase in youth crime. In the impoverished sectors, children at a very young age are forced by their parents to earn for the family. Admittedly, it is difficult for teenagers run the family as they do not have enough funds. Consequently, they are easily enticed by looting, knife crime, pick pocketing and other kinds of illegal acts to earn money. Hence, poverty is the key basis of social problem pertaining to children. Ċ To conclude, the rife with societal problems related to children is mainly because parents abandon their children as they cannot find a proper balance between work and personal life. However, I think that parental ignorance along with destitution is responsible for this issue."
9508,"On a daily basis, a great amount of food is being wasted away. What are the possible causes and what will be the solutions?","Modern societies and their people are being plagued by many problems. Moreover, it is considered recently that and abundance of food is being wasted away which can lead to damages to the environment. Because it's negative implications may run far and wide, it is more than necessary to look at the root causes and seek the possible countermeasures. Ċ The issue of excessive food waste could be accounted for by a broad spectrum of reasons. For one thing, people are now getting used to eating at restaurants instead of cooking by themselves. Nonetheless, the more individuals inclined to eat outdoor, the more possibilities can restaurants produce an exorbitance of food decomposition. For another, lots of wealthy families have nowadays tended to prepare excessive cuisines in their daily life, such as conducting celebrations, gatherings, or even different kinds of parties, which can contribute to generating massive food waste then cause profound repercussions to our environment. Ċ Although the rise of food waste does pose problems, there are remedial measures to turn this around. On one hand, experts should propagate the conception of the re-utilization of foods. For example, giving leftovers for animals like pigs and livestock to consume. Besides, technology plays a vital role. Humans now conceive the techniques of converting leftovers into a source of power, which may benefit a lot among the different aspects of our life. On the other hand, governments need to institute laws and fines to confine wealthy families who consume too much food, and also give rewards to companies and restaurants who achieve goals with the limitation of food waste. Ċ In a nutshell, despite the problems of food waste can lead to myriads of damages to our environment. Still, the causes must be located in the first place while effective solutions have to be designed to counter the problem. It is probably the most prudent way to address the issue related to food."
9509,"Topic: We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependent on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits.","Nowadays, computers are playing extensive role in our daily life's working such as business documentation, crime detection, moreover fly planes. Although, computers made our life easy but it has tendency to get easily effected by viruses which may cause of major damage. In my opinion, we should adopt computer technology with care. Ċ First of all, computers are helping us to save our time and it is also help us to maintain environment green due its ability of paperless working. For instance, to apply for any government job was lengthy process, now it is matter of one click. We have just simply log on to the concerned department's site & submit the application. By this, we can save both time & paper. Moreover, tracking application status is become very easy. Secondly, with the help of computer, we can easily record & retrieve the data. Ċ Although, use of computers have lot of benefits but these are very vulnerable of virus attack too. For example, banking account, email account hacking, personal & financial information hacking are name of few. Ċ However, it is very much possible that computers will more involve in our daily life. Driving car without driver may help to blind people for commuting. Scientist also may predict accurately about natural disaster. Ċ All in all, being updated and adopt computer technology is necessity of today's life, if we will use computers with little awareness, it can be more beneficial for us."
9510,People doing dangerous sports activities like scuba diving and bungee jumping should be responsible for their own life and rescue workers should not risk their lives to save people doing those sports. Ċ Do you agree or disagree?,"Wearing uniform in the work place has been popularised since the post modern era; however, there remains some disagreement as many consider this a negative development since it invade people's privacy. I, personally, consider that uniform brings unity between staff. Ċ On the one hand, it is an indisputable fact that when all employees wear a same apparel definitely provide a feeling of belongingness among workers. In other words, when all members of the company wear a same piece of dress make them relaxed and feel that they are part of the organisation, then, this boosts their morale. Eventually, they contribute even more to their association. A study conducted at Colorado State University and they published that wherever the similar apparels code is implemented, they have more productivity than one who do not. Ċ On the other side of the argument, several people advocate that compelling workers wear the same attire is an inversion to their privacy and I strongly support this viewpoint. This means that everyone has their own preferences when it comes attire, especially, in the workplace, this is because uncomfortable attire leads poor performance can also be reported. Therefore, many argue that instead of instructing this, it would be better if they have instructed to follow a dress code in their office. In addition, there is no guaranty that uniforms bring a unity in offices or any other workplace until people change their attitude towards other co- workers. Ċ By way of conclusion, people are differed regarding whether uniforms are good or not. Even thought certain supporters consider this is a positive advancement, in my opinion, having a dress code would be even more welcomed since this allows a certain amount of freedom in their clothing choices. It is predicted that, by doing this many advantages may acquire companies."
9511,Many countries thought that children have to do homework in their free time while other say children should do more outdoor activity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Children are the backbone and the future of every country; therefore, their better education and character building are considered as the state's responsibility in developed and educated countries. To accomplish this various policies are generated for their education by the government. One of them is to decide whether they should study or do some recreational work during their leisure hours. I strongly agree that children should be allowed to do some outdoor activities after school time Ċ First of all, studies today are tough and these kids are already burdened. In order to nourish little minds , making them involved in some other activity is essential. In this way, they can explore newer ways of learning . For instance, playing together with other kids will teach them how to make friends and increase their social circle in future Ċ Secondly, they will get exposure to the outer world like how things work, different behaviours etc. They will gain the knowledge of practical life that they can't take from memorizing the books and homework. During this, juveniles will also learn to love and respect nature and appreciate its beauty, hence, it will provide the energy for their regular study sessions. Ċ In a nutshell, studies along with some enjoyable physical activity are necessary for every individual and that applies to young ones too. Providing an ideal balanced environment to minors is the responsibility of both parents and country."
9512,"Some people say that parents have the most important role in child’s development. However, others argue that other things like television or friends have the most significant influence. Discuss both of view and give your opinion.","Presently, most of the children are showing interest in learning a lot of things. So, certain people opine that these people observes the important habits and develop them, with growing in age. On the contrary, other persons suggest that gadgets like the television and friends impact them a lot when compared to rest of the things. In this essay, I will debate on both the viewpoints and suggest my opinion. Ċ Firstly, the majority of children grew up by seeing their parents. Besides, they always try to be as a clone to their family member instead of thinking on their own. Secondly, people always get inspired by looking an elder person. Though they may not teach them any good habits, but giving them an important priority. A research stated that 90% of the students in the developed nations had given a positive response to their parent's affection. Ċ On the other hand, most of the children in the developing countries have mostly influenced by the modern technology. Indeed, these people are attracted towards the negative effects caused by the TV and friends. If elders are ordering their children to study, they are starting to file a criminal case on them. For instance, with the crime investigating movies most of the laws had become familiar to the majority of the public. Ċ In the conclusion, a likely reason why certain people believe that parent habits impact on most of the children because they had chosen them as their role models. Therefore, others believe that with the improvements in the latest technology people were influenced by the gadgets and other people. I believe that it completely depends on the environment of a person whether to be influenced by the parents or gadgets."
9513,"Some people believe that team sports are very important for children to succeed in their career, others disagree? Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many people think that sports which are based on teamwork, are very significant for children in order to be successful in their careers, whereas others disagree with this idea. As well as giving my opinion, this essay will discuss why group sports are entirely important for children’s future job prospects, and why these sports may be considered as insignificant. Ċ On the one hand, there are people who think that group sports play an important role in children’s career prospects. The main reason of this is that teamwork skills have become a necessity in the job market, and this skill can be improved by attending group sports. If children do not learn teamwork skills, it will be difficult to find a job for them, which can be satisfactory, in the future. For instance, big companies more prefer employing graduates which have cooperation skills. Another reason is that it is thought that children can improve their academic performance if they can learn how to cooperate with each other. To illustrate, studies have revealed that children who attend team sports such as football, basketball, and volleyball on a regular basis, perform better in collective assignments in school than those who don’t prefer attending team sports. In turn, they get more chance to enter into top universities. Therefore, team sports are notably important in their future job prospects. Ċ On the one hand, some people believe that sports which are based on cooperation are not important at all in children’s career. So, why do these people hold this opinion? The main reason of this may be that they believe that competitive sports are more important than team sports. For example, small businesses expect competitive skills from graduates these days because the job market has become competitive over a few decades. However, education experts suggest that competitive sports promote aggressive behaviours among children, and aggressive personalities will hardly find jobs who are paid high salaries. Thus, these people think that team sports are not important because the job market is fiercely competitive. Ċ In conclusion, the fact that team sports are very significant or not is increasingly a discussion topic among individuals. This essay discussed why team sports are totally important, and why they may be unimportant in a few situations. In my opinion, team sports are completely important because children can effortlessly be more successful in their career in the future."
9514,Question: Some say that people should continue to work in the same job for a lifetime; others say they should change the job at least once in their career. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and support it with examples. Answer:,"Nowadays, Job market is very competitive requires more knowledge and skilled professionals to cope up with technology revolution. Some people believe that sticking with one job for permanent in their career is best while others think that changing alternative career is the great. In this essay, I will explain both views in detail. Ċ Apparently, some people assume that continuing same career in lifetime acquires rigorous knowledge in their field. They gain more experience and specialist in tackle all the issues in their work. In addition, they have accurate decision making ability, management skills and strategies to handle their field work. If there is recession in their field they are laid off and cannot postulate in any other job result in stress and anxiety leads to suicide in some cases. Ċ On the other hand, people knowing two careers help them in difficult situation. For example, if an employee has experience or knowledge in both Information technology and hotel management, in recession if he lay off in Information technology field, he can switch over to Hotel Management field. Though it as advantage but have some disadvantage. We know the proverb, ""Jack in all but master in none""; according to the proverb they won't have exhaustive skill in their field. They are not a specialist to solve critical problem in their profession. Ċ In a nutshell, by analyzing both the views, my opinion is though having multiple career has some disadvantage it is useful in than a lifetime career which is always risk in this rising machinery world. Moreover, life time career have more disadvantage then advantage."
9515,"the older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave. however, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?","It is true that many older people believe in a certain ways of living which are not pretty suitable with the youngsters nowadays. While I believe that some ideas are outdated, I agree that other values should not be forgotten. Ċ There are some values which I believe are incompatible to this modern life. Firstly, the concept of when to marry or the rules of who we can get married to are changing. People thesedays often choose their partner with their own criteria and decide whether or not it is the right time to get married depend on different circumstances, such as work, feelings or readiness. Furthermore, the belief that we need to have a job for life is no longer normal. People have chosen to do many different things in order to choose which one is good for them. Ċ Despite several outdated ideas of life, there are plenty of good traits from traditional values. For examples, older generations have made a huge impact on working hard, always do one's best and take pride in one's work. These could benefit younger generations as they enter nowadays competitive world. Furthermore, some of the characteristics which are often seen as traditional such as politeness, humbleness or respect should be kept as youngsters are encountering many people from different backgrounds. Finally, I believe that younger generations could be happier if they live in an area where people can look after each other. Ċ In conclusion, traditional values have its drawbacks but I believe there are also several good things to be kept."
9516,Some people think that government should invest money in wildlife projects and protect them.Other people think it is better if the government invest money in other projects.Discuss both sides and give your opinion?,"While some individuals argue that the authorities should allocate funds for the conservation of a wide variety of plants and animal species, others consider that there are other essential issues, which needs to be focused.This essay will discuss both sides of the argument in depth.I, however, believe that the protection of the wild animals must be prime responsibility of the regimes. Ċ To commence with, a vast majority of people claim that governments should make an investment in the projects to conserve wildlife.This is simply because each species has its own significance and their extinction would consequently lead to an alarming threat to the survival of other creatures as well since it will disturb the whole food chain.For instance, the extinction of Dinosaurs triggered the survival of mammals to a substantial extent.Thus, it is mandatory for the authorities to look into this matter seriously otherwise ecological balance would be disturbed in a considerable amount. Ċ In contrast, another section of the community favours the allocation of a specific part of the national budget for several necessary projects.Since they believe that it is the most significant responsibility of the administration to look for the welfare of its citizens.Therefore, provision of the healthcare facilities, youth employment opportunities and eradication of poverty should be the major concern of the governing bodies.For example, in India, during COVID-19 pandemic, numerous people suffer due to the lack of modern equipments, such as ventilators, which highlighted the inadequate medical services in our country.To elucidate, these factors should not be overlooked as these are related to the safety and security of its citizens. Ċ In conclusion, despite the division of the society on the basis of proper distribution of grants, I believe that it is justified to take initiatives for the preservation of wildlife and it is vital for the balance of the ecosystem."
9517,Some people believe that all the company decisions should be taken by the managers whereas others think it is better to include employees while making decisions. Discuss both the points and give your opinion,"An organization consists of many people who have their own responsibilities. While some people think that boss should be in charge of every accord, some argue that the employee should also take a part in the decision making process. In this essay, I will discuss both views and give my opinion as a conclusion. Ċ Some people believe that manager as the highest position in the organization, is responsible for making decisions regarding the company matter. In other words, when people are in the highest position, they have more power to decide anything based on their analyses. For that purpose, they are paid more than people in lower position. For example, a production manager is being paid to controlling the production process and they fully responsible for the product quality. Because of that, they should be able to take any decisions which relate to the product quality. Needless to say, a responsibility makes people tend to decide something based on their own consideration. Ċ On the other hand, others think that all staff members should be involved in the decision making process because they are running a specific task so that they are the expert in that task more than the chief. In a company, there is a lot of work and usually it is handled by different people. They are responsible to achieve the task goal and when it is combined as a whole, it will achieve the association's target. This perception lead to an assumption that it would be better to involve staff members while making a choice because they know a lot of details about their work. For instance, gasket workers know the material that is used for packaging and how good it is to meet a standard packaging. Therefore, when the party wants to change their packaging policy, they should consider the worker's opinion, Ċ In conclusion, I believe that, let the employee in is crucial to give the company more specific information regarding certain matters. Having said that, the employee could provide the information, but the judgment maker is still the manager as it is his/her job."
9518,Many young people choose to take a year out between finishing school and starting university in order to gain work experience or to travel. The experience of non-academic life this offers benefits the individual when they return to education. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Gaining an experience of non-academic life during gap-year is the main reason why current individuals at a young age tend not to suddenly be involved in the university after graduating from school since It provides fringe benefits to them. Personally, I totally agree with this statement and I will elaborate in the following essay. Ċ Firstly, After graduation, Some students are unable to choose their interesting faculty and profession. If pupils do not decide properly, they will waste their whole time studying undesired courses, leading to affect pupils' mental healths, especially, stress and depression. Thus, deciding to take a gap year, which offers a short period to customise an effective decision and life, allows those students to gain non-academic acknowledgements and new perspectives from other places and people by travelling. For example, My pen pal comrade from overseas who took a year off in order to find out suitable courses, acquired inspiration while travelling and currently has worked as a successful artist. Ċ Secondly, taking a gap year in order to improve work experience play a crucial role in assisting those youngsters of significant faculty. Additionally, children who decided to work before joining the university are able to earn incomes and gain a standard experience, which benefits in the practical world and provides a bunch of opportunities in the institutes and workplaces, where require voluntary experiences. For instance, My peer who was involved in voluntary programmes overseas has received a specific certification and were easily accepted by the well-known university compared with my other comrades. Ċ In conclusion, Stopping from learning after graduating from high school in the short term not only offers a bunch of opportunities in the practical world but also prevent horrible mental health due to mistaken decisions."
9519,"Courses and general online study have recently become very popular. However, some people still prefer to attend classes in person. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","In this era, the distance education program through the internet is becoming a lot of people's preference. Whereas, the face-to-face lesson method is still chosen by a group of people. Therefore, ahead of my stance, both viewpoints can be done without removing the purpose of the study. This essay discusses both points and a logical conclusion will be provided in this essay. Ċ The distance learning program has some advantages for students and the environment. Firstly, for the student, it gives them the flexibility of time. For example, the materials of the study can be delivered by mail or e-mail. Thus, learners can study anytime and anywhere. Secondly, money for travel to school can be saved for something else which more important. For instance, the student can save money which they usually use to buy car fuel or public transportation. Thirdly, because people can stay and study at home, they do not need using their vehicles which is good for the environment. Consequently, it reduces air pollution caused by carbon dioxide produced by cars and another kind of transportations. Ċ In other hands, attending classes in person is also give some benefits. For example, learners are able to build their social life by contact with other students and their lecturers. Hence, this gives the opportunity to students social circle get bigger. In addition, the student is able to improve their communication skill. To elaborate, education accepters are able to discuss some particular topics with other students which thriving their ability of communication. Ċ To conclude, the distance learning program and direct face-to-face methods are the same. However, I believe both two point's purpose is to transfer information, as lecturers and to receive information as students. I hope this essay can give some ideas on how important education no matter the ways we choose."
9520,"Levels of youth crime are increasing rapidly in most cities Ċ around the world. Ċ What are the reasons for this, and suggest some solutions.","In many cities, the cases of delinquency are rapidly growing around the globe. The main reasons for that tendency are the propagation of violence on the internet and the lack of support from the administration. These issues might be solved by governmental aid and stricter rules about content for large web platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, etcetera. Ċ Propagation of violence is one of the root causes of increased levels of crime among youths. Many videos containing violent and rude attitude are regularly recommended by search engines and platforms. For instance, a great number of news portals suggest provocative video clips which contain confrontation of two men or a group of people on the streets of popular cities. Also, some of the modern influencers from popular social networks, such as YouTube, Instagram and Facebook, produce videos that encourage children and adults to do lawbreaking things. For example, one of the bloggers was ready to give anyone 100 dollars if one broke the window of a police department. Ċ The mentioned problems can be resolved with the help of the government. If the government in every country had financed charities and created more places to work, delinquency would not have increased. In addition, large IT companies, such as YouTube, Google and Twitter, should set stricter content policies on their platforms. All these measures are highly likely to improve the situation with youth crime as they eliminate the proliferation of violence and create a better social environment. A prime example would be Singapore. At present, this country has one of the lowest levels of crime around the world because of the support from the government and strict laws. Ċ In conclusion, poor support from governments and the propagation of violence are the root causes of high crime among youngsters. Right financing and stricter content policies possibly are likely to improve the current situation."
9521,a lot of money goes on family events People spend too much on family celebrations such as birthdays and weddings. What are the importance of these celebrations? Do you think people really spend too much?,"Nowadays people tend to spend a lot on family events like weddings and birthday parties. While these celebrations are vital of the function of building strong family bonding between family members, I believe they sometimes are wasting too much to make the event looks grand. Ċ It is undeniable that family celebrations take the essential role to the family as of it facilitating the reunion of family members. A birthday party for grandfather, for example, not only to celebrate of his birthday but also a chance for family members and relatives to group together. During the event they can meet, talk and share and I believe strong family bonding will be built throughout the event. Moreover a family celebration also suitable place for the announcement to carry out. Wedding party, for instance, is a place to let friends and families of husband and wife to meet and as a witness of two people form the family. Ċ Despite this, it will never be the excuse to spend so much on any celebration event. In fact it is common to seen people are too materialism when they are arranging their event of celebration. For example, they tend to hold it in the ball room of a grand hotel instead of restaurant or other places just because of the decoration. They also preferring luxury food and beverage as well as hiring live band for music just for better enjoyment and entertainment. By which I believe it is already not align with the main purpose of the celebrating event which needed at the beginning. Ċ In conclusion, although celebrating events are important for family reunion, their approach on overspending onto these are not encouraged."
9522,Is it more important to be able to work with a group of people on a team or to work independantly? Use reasons and examples to support your answer.,"As our world has been changing with a great pace during the recent decades, new approaches to organization of work force and development of products evolve. There is no doubt that the methods exploited by industrialists several ages ago are ineffective nowadays. In addition the globalization brings its own requirements and limits to the effective organization of work environment. We have to anylize how companies of all scale function now to answer question whether it is more important to work on a team or independantly. Ċ First, it should be noted that many companies abandon the classical organizational structures organizing people by function performed and utilize more actively project oriented structures, occuring when a group of specialists from different divisions work on the same project. The main reason, in my opinion, is that creation of new products and services requires participation of cross-fuctional teams with diversed experience from engeneering, marketing, and cost-analysis. So there is no chance for a person in such company to be effective contributor if he or she can not communicate with team members adequately. Ċ Second, even individual entrepreneurs operate in the environment which requires interaction with dozens of different organizations, entities, individuals, and regulators. So an employye of a small business who tend to work independently will not find his place in the company. Ċ I want to conclude that modern economy requires people to work in teams because complex problems faced by huminkind in the twenty first century can not be resolved by independant genious."
9523,In most countries multinational companies and their products are becoming more and more important. This trend is seriously damaging out quality of life. Ċ do you agree or disagree?,"It is true that globalization has been facilitating our lives since long. Therefore, the establishment of intercontinental groups and their manufactured items are getting familiar day by day and it is said that this is affecting our lives in true terms. However, I slightly agree with the statement despite some potential benefits. Ċ To begin with, there are quite a few reasons why I think that it is a negative development. It is seen that global agencies have an adverse effect on the local business as the construction of these multinational companies hinders the economic growth of the host country's entrepreneurs. Because people usually consider trending or branded products instead of their own country's material. For instances, Roots Canada is a brand of Canada, but people all over the globe prefer this brand a most and it is a pivotal reason behind the inculcation of universal products in a nation. Thus, it is clear why the consequences of the sequence are myriad. Ċ Conversely, it is also true that the positive side of the trend could not be ignored. If one country has worldwide branches of the products, then it will definitely make the people's life easier as they could easily buy that particular item from their residential country. Even immigrants could purchase the local products of their home country without any difficulty. For example, In Canda,there is a Verka Milk Plant which is a company of India and they are making milk products such as Paneer, Dahi, cheese the Same as Indian flavour. Overall, the development of firms at a global level has its own benefits which could not be overlooked. Ċ To conclude, it is totally acceptable that the World has become a global village, that's why the worldwide franchise of one brand or product are common these days and it has both benefits and drawbacks."
9524,"Countries are much more interesting and develop more quickly when the population includes a mixture of different nationalities and cultures, to what extend do you agree or disagree?","It is not uncommon that a country with missed nationalities and cultures developed so much in recent years. However, as far as I am concerned, it still accompany with some problems. Ċ Admittedly, a multi-cultured country attracts increasingly more people all over the world as individuals, out of curiosity, are fond of experiencing different cultures. Due to the availability of a wider array of entertainment, abundant tourist attractions could be the driving force of tourist development, which will boost the local economy to certain extent. Ċ On the other hand, countries with the population include different nationalities and cultures may not be stimulating and developed. People from different countries have their own opinion towards values. Accordingly, they may not understand others behaviour which could be regard as the barrier for communication among various cultures. If not deal with an appropriate means, it may cause ethnic conflicts. Even worse, in some countries, it is not common that some people discriminate against the minority groups. For instance, mass media have revealed an Indian boy was attacked by a gang of people in Melbourne with no reason. Thus, I believe no one will find the country is interesting and go to a unstable country with potential dangers. Ċ Clearly, it is the trend people from different countries living together; therefore my suggestion is government should give priority to facilitation of the cultural communication and mutual trust to promote the development of the state as a whole."
9525,Many people like to wear fashionable clothes. Why do you think this is the case? Is this is a good thing or a bad thing?,"Citizenry likes wearing trendy clothes. According to my perspective, this may be due to a plethora of reasons like maintaining social status, easy access, western influence, and so on. This style is having both pros and cons, which will be dealt with in this essay with relevant examples. Ċ To begin with, the public enjoys wearing fashionable dresses. As far as I am concerned, it is having some leverages. In essence, allies feel the need to dress up in foreign attire in order to maintain their status in society. For example, youngsters adopt jeans and T-shirts as their daily routine because it makes them look more sophisticated. Furthermore, stylish outfits can be worn easily without much effort like pressing. Moreover, people actually prefer such a style due to the impact of foreign culture. To give an example, college students love Indo-Western clothing in competition with other middle-class pupils. Ċ Nonetheless, for the sake of playing devil's advocate, modern costumes have several bad effects too. Firstly, they may look indecent at a few gatherings. To illustrate, generally, youth prefer modernised set-up even in parties, but few guests will take it negatively and start giving comments. Secondly, folk's clothing always in westernised manner will definitely leave a negative impact on the next generation as the world is becoming more and more fashionable and immature ones may get deviated from the path. For instance, my neighbour's daughter always want to be on a sleeveless top as right from childhood she got accustomed to it seeing his mother. Ċ To conclude, citizens relish modish garments as they opine that it gives them an elegant look as well as less maintenance, along with influence from abroad, pull them towards such ensemble. However, on occasions, it also is responsible for many individuals to leave their tradition."
9526,Some people believe that living in big cities is becoming more difficult. Others believe that it is getting easier. Discuss both views and give your opinion.  Ċ Or Ċ Describe the advantages and disadvantages of living in the city.,"We are living in a modern era. Now people want to live in a city to enjoy several facilities. Some people think that surviving in a town is not easy, it provides worries and demerits. I disagree with the statement. Ċ To begin with, people who live in a city can get a better quality lifestyle which is not available in the countryside. In addition, in a city community find many kinds of job opportunities which can give them a strong financial condition. Moreover, capital hospitals are very well equipped, as a result, the public can take high-quality treatment. Furthermore, for studying in a standard educational institution's people must have to live in a town. For example, I live in the capital city of Bangladesh. Since, great 1 until my master's degree, I studied in a renowned Institution. My results are quite good. A plethora of activities can be done in city life, such as people can go to Museums, shopping malls, restaurants, cafes, parks and so on. Therefore, they can spend their leisure time amazingly. Which can refresh their mind and soul. Thus, living in a town has many advantages. Ċ On the other hand, living in a city is not simple. Sometimes people face so many barriers. Firstly, there is a lot of noise pollution in cities which can hamper their hearing. Secondly, the town is very crowded so it is tough to find a living place and job. Thirdly every day, they have to struggle a lot during reaching their destination due to traffic congestion. Fourthly, in city life, people have to spend lots of money to get fresh food and other things. Last but not the least, the community can not get fresh air in city life due to air pollution. For instance, I read an article about air pollution, in that article, it was mentioned that city is polluted higher than the countryside which brings great risk for our life. Ċ In conclusion, I can say that every coin has two sides like living in a city has benefits and drawbacks, but in my point of view city life has more advantages rather than disadvantages."
9527,We are becoming increasingly dependent on computer–based technology. How do you think it will change in the future? Is it good for us to rely so much on computers?,"An extremely important topic today is related to our dependency on computers and other technologies. Even though computers are relatively new inventions, they have become an indispensable part of our lifestyles. In this essay, I am going to elaborate on the prospects of technology and reliance on it. Ċ To begin with, in my opinion, technologies have a promising future. Even though modern people are becoming more dependent on devices, such as computers and smartphones, there are also some benefits. New machines are constructed to facilitate the workflow. For instance, a recent breakthrough in the medical field was made. A doctor performed a remote- control surgery over a 5-G network with the help of robotic arms. This example shows us that we rely on certain machines that couldn’t be possible without the fast pace development of technologies. Apparently, in the future, there will be more devices in our working environment and we should learn how to work with them. Ċ On the other hand, it is not acceptable to rely on computers all the time. Computers can link us to the Internet and thus provide us with information and knowledge, which can sometimes be unreliable and biased. Furthermore, recently conducted research shows that they can cause us “digital dementia”. “Digital dementia” is a term used to define our disability to remember information, which we could do if we do not overuse our modern devices. For example, the overuse of the World Wide Web makes us too dependable and we are less likely to think logically. This is because the information is readily/already provided and we take it for granted. By doing this , we decrease our memory and concentration abilities. Ċ To summarise , I firmly believe that although computers give us numerous benefits, future revolutions will certainly exceed our expectations. However, even if those prospects are extremely appealing to us, we should remain responsible and never use them too much."
9528,"should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.","It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Ċ Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Ċ Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. Ċ These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors."
9529,"With a great variety of social networking websites,people often add complete strangers to their friend lists.Do you think that this tendency helps people to find new friends or is it just a mean to increase their self-esteem ?justify your opinion with relevant examples.","The usage of social networking sites has increased dramatically over the last few years. Although there are detrimental effects associated with it, the positive impacts cannot be neglected. I believe that it jas a significant contribution in bringing people closer. This essay will discuss various aspects of this topic. Ċ To commence with, social networking sites have a pivotal role in mitigating the communication gap between various communities. These have allowed us to connect with people all around the world. In addition to this, they also provide us with updates and news, creating a new world without a ground. People, for instance, can use this platform to highlight social issues, such as racism, resulting in putting pressure on the authorities to take action accordingly. Ċ On the contrary, over usage of the internet has shown negative impacts on our society. People use these sites excessively and become disjointed from their families in the pursuit of new friends. Teenagers, for example, tend to spend more hours on the internet affecting their relationship with their loved ones, resulting in an overall impact on social bonding. Moreover, children who are stressed due to their low performance at school or having peers who negative influence them, tend to find these social networking sites a way to increase their self-esteem. Ċ In conclusion, after a thorough analysis of the topic, while there are benefits of this technology, we have dire impacts as well. I believe that there should be a balance between the usage of this technology and family bonding time as it is the family’s responsibility to help their children attain confidence."
9530,"Too much attention is paid to and so much money is spent on keeping pets, while people throughout the world are starving. discuss the argument for and against keeping pets. to what extent do you agree?","Pets have been existing in human life for centuries. With the enhancement of people's cultural standard, people nowadays tend to keep pets for relaxing or other purposes. However, it emerges a question that should people spend their concentration and money on keeping pets of share them with those who are living in poverty all over the world? These points of view will be discussed in two following paragraphs Ċ It is undeniable that keeping pets will benefit people very much. When it comes to some kinds of disease, pets like dog can be very valuable to some people who are suffering from deaf or mental disorder diseases. As a vivid illustration, dog can play a role as guider of disable people: alarming deaf people in some emergency situation. In addition, keeping pets is a mean of entertainment. In many Western countries, some people consider their pets as their sons or daughters. They find it very difficult to live without them. Ċ On the other hand, many argue that rich people who afford to keep pets should share their money and concentration with poor ones. While many people can rest on their laurels or even live in a lap of luxury, other people are struggling with poverty. They even do not have enough food or pure water. Therefore, is it fair that many people are facing to the death while such animals called pets can still live, even in a very comfortable way? Ċ All things considered, people have the right to raise pets. However, they should balance between their attention paid to pets and to starving people. In my opinion, it is worth remembering that people are always more precious than any creatures. So, people should not spend much money on raising pets"
9531,Would you prefer to live in a traditional house or in a modern apartment building? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.,"Nowadays, most of inhabitants prefer to live in a new flat building. However, because of some reasons, others prefer to stay in classic houses which have more healthily environment during their lives. Personally, I prefer to live in a place which has good weather and could make me feel comfort when I live there. Ċ In this globalization era, modern building such as apartments and hotels are built in the city center which has bad environment. This location was influenced by pollution from many vehicles and factories surround it. As a result, societies who live there are difficult to find green areas that could help them to get fresh air. Their lives are depended on modern equipment only such as air-conditioning, refrigerator, washing machine, and the other electronic tools. This situation brings them to a bad lifestyle because they never feel the fresh and healthy environment. Also, this could bring some danger diseases for them. Ċ However, good comfort weather only could be found in a place which has fresh air and there are many plants that support the fresh environment there. This usually happens in some mountainous areas which has a lot of trees and flowers. So, citizens who live there would get healthier condition and of course better health quality. Every day, they can consume fresh vegetable and fruit from the garden around their house with no doubt that the plans there are influenced by dangers fertilizers. Ċ In a nutshell, people are free to choose where they want to stay during their lives. But, they should pay more attention with the quality of places where they will life. They should consider for living in a place which has health environment. As a result, they could stay happily with their relatives for a long period. Also, they will stay healthily longer than people who stay in a bad environment place."
9532,Recent research has shown that business meetings and training are increasingly taking place online. What are the advantages and disadvantages?,"Online business meetings and training are prevalent these days. Although people could take advantage of its convenience, the productivity of means of meeting and training is a problem. This essay will discuss both benefits and drawbacks of it. Ċ The greatest advantage of organizing meeting and training on the internet is that it is more convenient for attendants to take part in the meetings and training. For example, people could attend meetings and training anywhere just with their electronic devices, which could save their time on commuting and provide more spare time for them to get work and life balance. On the other hand, many organisations could save their cost as a result of using online meetings. Consequently, people can get many benefits from online meeting and training. Ċ However, online meeting and training have their own disadvantages that some people might be less productive when they are attending a meeting online. It is sometimes difficult for people to concentrate on their meetings as there are many distractors these days. In addition, communication in person is more direct. For instance, a recent survey shows that many interviewees tend to feel harder to focus on their work when they are working from home. Therefore, the productivity of online meeting and training is one of the main problems many people concern. Ċ In conclusion, online business meetings and training are increasingly popular nowadays. Despite sometimes it is better to interact with others in person, the convenience of holding meetings and training online could not be ignored. This essay discussed both its advantages and disadvantages."
9533,Television Sporting shows such as the Olympics motivate the youth who do not like to exercise much. Do you agree or disagree?,"The issue of whether television Sporting shows motivate the young people to play sport has become controversial in the contemporary society. Some people believe that these TV programs inspire the youth, specifically teenagers to exercise through famous athletes and great successful people. Personally, I entirely disagree for a number of reasons. Ċ To begin with, there is ample evidence to suggest that there are multifarious sports channels which target people who dislike physical exercises. The central reason behind this is these sports programmes are more likely to entice individuals those already have an interest in doing exertion or playing outdoor games. For instance, study by sports authority of the USA, showed that 95% of the crowds watching a tennis match during Wimbledon the ones have not a strong desire in playing tennis. Therefore, sports event failed to bring any interest in sports activities. Ċ Furthermore, it also should not be forgotten that the athletic events fail to encourage the young generation on exercising because these events. This is generally due to the fact that people who usually dislike exercising, are the ones who have a lack of awareness in doing workout in their health. To illustrate, during the Olympics most of the people being couch-potato, stick to one place, and keep watching TV whole day continuously. Thus, it is conclusively clear that sports do not drive any message to sleepy youth in order to foster to perform physical movement. Ċ To conclude, after analysing all the arguments mentioned above, I firmly believe that sports programmes may imbue laziness in teenagers rather than persuade them to exercise. Hence, I hope that young people will watch less sports programs and will go to gyms."
9534,Television dominates the free-time of too many people. It can make people lazy and prevent them from socialising with others. Ċ Do you agree or disagree?,"Tourism helps people from other countries to understand the citizens of the visiting country. I disagree with the statement because the tourists mostly visit some well-developed spots and they mainly stay in a big hotel. Ċ To begin with, the visitors from the other nations always visit a place, which is already developed for tourism. Moreover, the population in those places are dependent on visiting humans for a living. Therefore, the interaction between them would mainly consist of the details about the place and its history. For example, Dubai, the most beautiful place in the Gulf, is visited by people from all over the world, but no one is aware of the lifestyle of their citizens. Additionally, they have all kinds of infrastructure built for the visitors, who come and go without any communications. Ċ Similarly, tourists prefer to stay in the biggest resort if possible. The staff and the natives there are well trained to give only good messages for promoting the tourism industry. So, the person who visits those places and stays in a hotel wouldn't know the real cultures and traditions of the local people. For instance, recently an article published in the Times showed Mumbai as the most visited zone in India from foreign countries and is the safest area to visit. However, the real story would only be known when you keep your foot outside the motel at night. Ċ To conclude, even though tourism helps a person to interact with the inhabitants from another country, it is difficult to understand the real situation, culture and traditions of the natives, as most tourists don't come in contact with a real person of that town in a real situation."
9535,"e planet’s population is reaching unsustainable levels, and people are facing a shortage of resources like water, food, and fuel. To what consequences may overpopulation lead? In your opinion, what measures can be taken to fight overpopulation?","In recent years, the population have been growing dramatically and leading towards over utilisation of natural resources, resulting in the depletion of those to a greater extent. I believe that we can collectively take measures together with the authorities to control the depletion by spreading awareness introducing certain rules. This essay will list the problem associated with overpopulation and provide further details on measures to control the situation. Ċ To commence with, one of the major problems that are caused due to the rapid population growth is the increases in the environmental concerns, such as pollution, and deforestation leading to the loss of the habitat of the animals and threatening their existence. Due to the increased number of individuals, there is a rise in the demand for land, consequently, leading to the cutting down of forests and occupying the space meant for them. In addition, we might not be able to maintain a proper healthcare system if the population rate grows in the same trend. Lack of medical care, for instance, might affect the quality of our lives. Ċ However, there are a few measures that can help us maintain our ecosystem and prevent overutilisation like spreading awareness and imposing certain laws. Firstly, initiating awareness campaigns to educate the negative impacts, especially in rural areas. They are not aware of the severity of the situation, so this might help them realise the grave danger that we are anticipating if not controlled. Similarly, the government should come up with policies to control the increasing number of individuals, for example, by giving free births control kits. Ċ In conclusion, it is evident that there are severe impacts of the population growth like loss of biodiversity, over utilisation of resources and scarcity in terms of medical help, whereas these can be controlled and mitigated by taking measures like educating the public about its dire impacts along with the introduction of strict rules by the authorities."
9536,Task: To what extent is nuclear technology a danger to life on Earth? What are benefits and risks associated with its use?,"Achievemens in a nulear field have promised the humankind realizable solutions to solve problems associated with environment and energy. However, it also brings with itself grave risks. Obiectively, if we enhance our awareness of monitoring nuclear reactions, its benefits are abviously overweight than its threats. Ċ From a positive aspect, utilising nuclear energy is clean without emission of harmful gases. Therefore, energy obtained from nuclear reactions is much more superior to fossil fuels that have been dominated in the world. Furthermore, another remarked advantage of nulcear energy is its capacity of creating a massive amount of energy from only a very little bit of chemical substances. This feature becomes valuable when natural resources is getting exhausted. Ċ From a negative aspect, nuclear technology can become a terrible threat to life on Earth. The top-ranked threat is a contamination of the surroundings by radioactivity. Back to history, the humankind witnessed many leaks of nulear factories put residents at risk of getting dead diseases like cancer, mutation. More importantly, developed countries can take their advantages in nuclear aspects to put pressure on other countries. For this reason, a race for nuclear weapons that endangers an existance of the Earth cannot be stopped in the near future. Ċ To sum up, if leader of nations no longer nourish their dream of conquering the word with a help of nuclear science, the human beings could enjoy the wonders of nuclear technology brought into life."
9537,"People should choose their course of study not on the basis of their own interests, but based on the kinds of jobs they can get. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In this world of rat race, it has been suggested that the student's educational course choice must align with the jobs they want in the future. I disagree with this notion since it is a usual practice that students might not like the profession they have chosen at the beginning; furthermore, they can find a successful career in their passion. Ċ Without a qualm, children are naive when they start their education in high school; therefore, they might choose something which they may not find amusing in their later age. What I mean is that by selecting subjects on the basis of work requirements, they fall into a downward spiral. First, they have to learn what they do not find amusing, thus, they have to toil hard to complete their education. Next, they struggle to enjoy their job and find it exasperating. Finally, they end up dropping out of the school; hence, land on unsatisfactory low-paying career. To illustrate, according to an academic research in Cambridge university half of the American workforce are working in un-interested jobs owing to wrong selection of educational streams. Ċ At the opposite end of the spectrum, Following your passion makes you happy and successful. To be more precise, people go the extra mile if they are studying the subject of their choice. As a result, it has been observed that people studying their favourite subjects are highly probable of getting successful. What is more, following your interest provide a sense of fulfilment in the professional front. For instance, in an article published in Forbes it shows that people working in the field of their choice are paid well and are extremely satisfied with their life. Ċ In conclusion, having discussed the aforementioned reasons, I concur that student must follow their passion rather studying for a job title. It will render a peaceful and a high-paying professional career."
9538,"Despite a large number of gyms, a sedentary lifestyle is gaining popularity in the contemporary world. What problems are associated with this? What solutions can you suggest?","No one can deny that a prevailing part of society is prone to have a sedentary lifestyle despite the increasing number of gyms. This way of living might lead to some problems such as being obese and having depression, therefore it should be tackled with the cooperation of citizens and the government. Ċ There are several issues that are related to being inactive. First and foremost, a major problem which people can face is extra weight. That is to say, if one does not take part in any activities, he or she will be overweight. As a result, a person might have illnesses like diabetes or injuries with knees. Moreover, the problem of clothing can occur due to being obese. In other words, modern trendy clothes are suitable for fit human beings, although there is a rapidly rising trend of the body positive movement. Finally, a lack of exercise can be a real reason why people suffer mental diseases. What I mean is that according to some scientists, if a person neglects to participate in outdoor activities including going for a walk or going to the gym, this human being is likely to suffer from stress and insomnia. Ċ There are an array of solutions that should be applied. The main approach in order to cope with is the promotion of sport among children of school age and the youth. If there were no programs encouraging them to be active, adolescents would spend all their spare time in front of the screen holding electronic devices. Therefore, the authority responsible for the health and education of youngsters ought to make up plans to motivate students to take up the sport as a pastime in their free time. In addition, a monthly fee of gym memberships can be taken under the control of the government. For example, the payment of swimming pools or well-equipped sports clubs may cost a fortune for impoverished families. Ċ To sum up, a high quantity of gyms notwithstanding, the problem of being inactive remains topical among all layers of society. It should be addressed via the partnership of the government and people."
9539,Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples from your experience.,"When suffering from health issues, many people tend to explore on the Internet for possible solutions. However, personally I believe seeking for formal medical advices should be the correct act to do instead. Ċ On the one hand, due to the tremendous amount of free information available in the digital world, many people can now search online for suitable treatments according to the symptoms they are suffering. In some series cases it might be feasible as certain useful solutions can always be found. For example, putting a cold towel on forehead can help in case of fever to certain extent. Some people, therefore, tend to believe Internet information, as long as it is not a medicine intake to the body, can help lessen their symptoms to certain extent. Ċ On the other hand, however, some argue that surfing online for medical advice is very risky because it is inevitable that there would be misleading information in the virtual database. And more importantly, the majority is lack of professional knowledge to decide whether the information is correct or not. Also, if it leads to potential delay in receiving formal treatment, patients might be at risk and resulting in worse long-term consequences to their bodies. So more people agree that online information should not be trusted as official medical advices. Ċ In conclusion, searching for health solutions on the web is not appropriated because there is always fake information online and general public does not equip with the professional knowledge to judge. It is better for patients to seek formal advice from qualified medical staffs to ensure they receive the most suitable treatments."
9540,Advertising encourages consumers to buy in quantity rather than promoting quality. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Commercials have radically succeeded in this modern era, while product promotion influences people to purchase in more numbers instead of improving its quality. Therefore, I agree with this statement that announcement on displays persuades people to shop devoiding its standard. Ċ To embark upon, the businesses starting by many shops write up their by-products to appeal to customers, motivating them to buy more, despite not considering its features. In other words, the manufacturer advertises in many different ways and encourages men and women to spend money on buying it despite its worst status. For example, when one of my friends bought a cosmetic last week that was dirt cheap, she found that she got an allergy because of its inferior characteristics. Consecutively, society gets mesmerised by offers through flyers, handouts, pamphlets etc., by not visualising its condition. Ċ However, at discounts besides peculiarities and specifications, some menial goods can be purchased. That is to say; the low-cost purchases can be purchased without taking any risks if the usage of the thing is short-spaned.To evident, I ordered face masks online that were in festive sale, wore them just for a week, and trashed it. Therefore, particular use and throws or tissues can be spent for cheaper quality in large numbers during price reductions. Ċ In conclusion, though traders eyewash the community with online and offline advertisings and sell out unvalued productions, this is sometimes considered to focus on buying small things such as gloves, cotton, masks, etc. So, the idea must be revised to double-check its standard and rate in case of expensive items."
9541,"Some people think that good teamwork makes a company successful, while others think that good leadership is the reason behind the success of a company. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Despite the fact that it has been pointed out that excellent collaboration contributes to a profitable firm, other people believe that the reason why a company earning money is good leadership. Personally, I agree with the former idea as sharing various thinking styles between employees result in a successful company. Ċ On the one hand, some individuals, including me, argue that employees' cooperation is the main feature to make a team successful. The reason is that as every member has their own personality and characteristics, so they have distinct thoughts towards one problem. If a corporation tends to collect various ideas about an issue from their staff, leaders of this team are more likely to make the right decision, thus running a successful organization. For instance, most famous accounting firms, such as PWC and KPMG, always pay more attention to encourage their workers to share information when they need to make a decision. Their supervisors say that different employees have different educational and cultural backgrounds, their workers’ wide range of ideas is beneficial to make decisions efficiently and accurately and even determine our firm success. Ċ On the other hand, other people opine that a clever leader is a crucial point to a successful organization. This is because a professional leader has abilities to adjust the company's strategies when different issues happen, which is more important than working in harmony. As an illustration, a huge number of owners whose companies have shut down state that although their different departments could work in harmony, they did not have a manager who is equipped with a variety of skills to navigate their firms, which causes that they still need to close down. Ċ In conclusion, although people may vary in their opinions about what factors result in a profitable and productive corporation, I am of the opinion that cooperation between workers is the vital influencer to operate a fascinating business."
9542,Any new technological development in the recent years is a boon or curse for the society in general new technology - a blessing or a threat?,"Science and technology have great influence on human life since their inception. A lot of technological enhancements have taken place in the developing society, and which are conspicuously affecting people's life. Considering this, some analysts argue that technology is improving our life, while, others think it is creating problems. This essay focuses on some pros and cons of technological advancements and asserts the appropriate conclusion. Ċ To begin, technology has made our life very comfortable. It is clear that computers these days are so efficient and easy to use for people that they become a part of their life. Furthermore, with the advent of electronic communication world has become a global village. For instance, VOIP technology helps people to do face-to-face conversation with their kin and kith anytime. Moreover, technology enhances the students interest and intimacy towards their studies. They can watch recorded video tutorials to clear their concepts in any field. Also, medical discoveries occur at a much more rapid rate; thanks to machines and computers that aid in the research process and allow for more intense educational research into medical matters. Ċ On the other hand, technology also brings some threats to people. Firstly, the inventions of weapons especially nuclear war gadgets are extremely dangerous for the existence of the entire life forms on the Earth. Secondly, an increased use of motor vehicles causes the contamination of the environment which eventually causes certain problems such as rise in a surface temperature and global warming. Lastly, companies that depend heavily on computer systems to conduct business can come to a virtual standstill if the system breaks down. Ċ To conclude, I pen down saying that, the advantages of technologies outweigh disadvantages. However, as every garden has some weeds, higher authorities must take appropriate steps to reduce its negative effects."
9543,Why do students prefer doing part-time jobs during their studies? Ċ Do you think this has more advantages than disadvantages.,"The vast majority of student prefer doing part time jobs during thir studies. I think that this type of job have more advantages than disadvantages. Ċ Firstly, nowadays more and more students need to earn a salary in order to be able to pay their studies. Moreover, in the last years, due to the inflaction, prices are going up so they need more money to study and to have a healty lifestyle. Recent researches show that in these days students purchase power is 30% lower compared to 20 years ago. To cite an example, I studied in Rome and while I worked for the entire course as a receptionist, that gave me the possibility to afford all my expenses and be autonomous. Ċ Furthermore, when students search for a job, they tend to prefer part-time jobs as most of the time they are more suitable to their study schedule. Part-time jobs normally offer: more flexibility, so students can attend their lessons, more free time, thus, they could study for more time and be prepared for exams, althougth, it offer a limited amout of money. On the other hand, Full-time jobs could give the opportunity to inmates to save some earnings for the future in spite of free time and flexibility. For instance, while I was studying, one of my friends used to work full time for an international company, and as a result he ended up his master 1 year later compared to me with a part-time job. Ċ To sum up, I believe that having a part-time job could help students to improve even more as they will have more time and more flexibility so they could reach better result. Also, I feel that both governments and universities should take seriuos measures in order to create a free and easy access to the job market for students."
9544,Smokers can cause themselves serious health problems. The choice to smoke is made freely and with knowledge of dangers. Smokers should therefore expect to pay more for medical treatment than non-smokers. Ċ To what extent do you agree with this statement?,"With the free option of whether anyone likes to adapt tobacco has lead severe medical issue to smokers. However, they are considered to increase expenditure on the health system. Since the cardio system and lungs are directly linked to smoking. In my opinion, more health issues cause more expenses on our medical facilities Ċ Undoubtedly, the most prevailing reason behind health issues is smoking. This is because burnt nicotine is toxic for a person and gets inhaled, which directly rises into abnormally on mouth, lungs and cardio along with other parts of the body, therefore the normal function is aborted. For instance, a man smokes and one hole in heart gets filled with a gas and blocks oxygen’s path, thus a heart gets failure. Consequently, the internal physical process is at a high risk of damaging. Ċ On the other side, a more normal body function gets disturbed. Firstly, the more expenses for medical treatment will be required, because every abnormality needs specific testing to get diagnosed, thus an each particular treatment has different or same, but separate fees. Such as, the problem of lungs requires “Lungs function” test, while “Electrocardiogram” testing for the cardio. Hence, every disease has its unique method to get diagnosed and cured. Ċ In conclusion, the cigar provides external relief, but hazardous to the internal fitness of the body, which leads to get an illness and may result in a shorter lifespan along with more expenditure. I believe that inhaling tobacco may result in indirect spoiling of life."
9545,People from many countries are marrying later and having fewer children. Give reasons why this is happening. Ċ Are there any positive or negative developments regarding this?,"There’s an increasing trend of individuals from various countries getting married later and having lesser number of offsprings. This essay will succinctly explain why financial stability and proper home planning are the reasons why these are rampant. Ċ Firstly, it is not uncommon to hear about folks in other climes getting married at later stages of their lives and having relatively fewer progenies. This is because, the quest to become financially buoyant and have the capacity to completely cater for the needs that arise from such union is often a priority that must not be overlooked and underestimated. As a result, more time is spent on garnering enough resources that solidly fortify them and guarantees safe havens for the incoming partners and unborn children. For instance, folks in Germany would rather wait till they own their homes and have six figure savings before any conjugal commitment. This will obviously extend the period it takes to get married, and force them to get hitched later rather than sooner. Ċ Another point to consider, is the fact that, individuals in many societies take household planning with great level of seriousness, that often make them arrive at decisions quite later than usual. For example, more time is spent discussing issues like family size, size of home, location and the likes. This amount of time-real estate, elongates planning, and decisions are arrived at much later periods than usual. Studies carried out by University of Kuala Lumpor clearly explained the link between the increase in marriage down-time in Malaysia and need for financial and household planning. This experiment was later corroborated by other South Asian countries. Hence, certain individuals in other climes, take seriously these factors when making their marital plans. Ċ In conclusion, while there are positive consequences of getting married later and having children, like, financial stability and proper household planning, there are also certain demerits that should be noted. These include reduced time spent with children, which may lead to less bonding, that, fosters trust between offsprings and parents."
9546,Many companies and organizations require their employees to wear a uniform. What kind of jobs need uniforms? What are the advantages and disadvantages of wearing a uniform to work?,"It is evident that several companies and organizations mandate it on their employees to wear dress code. While some individuals think that following an outfit is beneficial, others think that they are redundant. In this essay, we shall elaborate on the merits and demerits of putting on a uniform. Ċ To begin with, uniforms are worn by many private and government workers such as police officers, health professionals, army officers, and company employees. This is because it distinguishes them from the crowd, and makes them recognizable. Another reason is that it displays their accolades; for example, soldiers, and general officers are rewarded with medals and badges which are attached to their outfit, and thus elevating their status in the society. Additionally, private organizations utilize this method to advertise their name and brand to the public. Overall, there are many advantages of wearing a uniform for both employees, and companies. Ċ On the contrary, some people do not favour such a practice. For instance, specific clothes appear monotonous and lack any creativity, especially when the attire has a mundane colour and combination. Moreover, some individuals consider style or fashion as their stronger feature and hence get frustrated and hesitant in following a dress code. However, uniforms are consensual and a person can decide to opt for a different field which does not require singular clothing. Ċ To summarize, there are two sides to a coin. Therefore, although there are pros and cons to wearing a specific attire. Alternatively, an individual benefits more when they decide to wear separate clothing because it makes them stand out, and all of the reasons mentioned above."
9547,Some people claim that many things that children are taught at school are a waste of time. Other people argue that everything that children study at school is useful at sometime. Ċ Discuss the both views and give your opinion.,"Certain people support the idea that some things that children are taught at school are useless, while other individuals believe that everything learned could be useful at some point. Although the complaints of the first group are understandable, in fact, children always benefit at least from the learning processes involved. And while I would like to see more practical lessons being taught, I support the idea that everything learned could be useful in some aspect. Ċ It would be very good to see young students making good and practical use of most things learned at school. Many people could relate to some of the complaints around this topic because even when we look back at our past, we can remember learning many things that were never useful in any practical form. For example, even if you work with mathematics there were formulas that you learned that you probably never used in your whole life, the same applies to every other area of study. As a result, certain people and especially parents, wouldn't be supportive of some classes their children are taking at school. Ċ On the other hand, most of us do not exactly understand how the processes of learning work. Furthermore, we are not competent to decide whether something could be useful or not, because even when we don't learn something practical, the process of rationalizing and achieving the answer could be important to our brain development. For instance, the logical thinking is constantly used in our lives even without our acknowledgement. In addition, teachers can stimulate the interests of some students when they get involved in certain topics, such as the environment, animal care and protection, health care and many others. Ċ In conclusion, I like to think that the fact that some things are not exactly practical to the students doesn't mean that they are a waste of time. Moreover, even though the lessons taught themselves could become useless in the children's lives, the learning processes are still valuable and important to both their development and their discovery processes."
9548,Homeschooling is becoming increasingly popular as more and more parents are choosing to educate their children in this way. Why do you think parents might choose homeschooling rather than traditional schools? Do you think homeschooling is more beneficial?,"Education is the birthright for each individual juvenile in their life. In recent days remote schooling is being increased extensively as many parents are choosing it. In this essay, while I discuss the various reasons why this is increasingly adopted over traditional schooling, in addition, I will give supporting examples of why conventional learning is still beneficial over homeschooling. Ċ Predominantly there are two important reasons being claimed by online education supporters. The primary being, without a second thought it can save students from dangerous viruses present in the environment, which are consequently pushing several children to fall ill very frequently. On average, for instance, every child before this pandemic was visiting the hospital once in a quarter due to illness. Adding to this, physical attendance is really not a mandate for students due to the emergence of technology solutions to attend classes from home. The current pandemic, for instance, has made the entire world realise technology platforms like Zoom, Microsoft teams have helped to onboard the majority of schools to continue teaching online. Ċ On the contrary, other groups of people, including me, think that there are various direct and indirect benefits of traditional and conventional teaching introduced from ancient times. The undeniable first advantage being, the amount of value addition that the school environment brings in the context of socialising. A child would be able to conquer very good insights, for example, on the current world happenings over the casual interactions with their schoolmates, which is not in the case of remote classes. Apart from this, children's exposure to outside home environments will improve their immunity power to fight mild infections, otherwise, they are prone to virus attacks very easily. There is a need for a juvenile to attend competitive exams or camps, for instance, where they have to come out of home premises. Ċ In conclusion, online learning has increasingly been adopted by many parents because of various advantages including the safety of adolescents from viruses and in addition to simplifying the life of a student by leveraging the technology. However, the traditional schooling methodology has its indispensable benefits over homeschooling like improving the cognitive abilities of a child with the help of social interactions."
9549,Some people prefer to work at home while others prefer to work in their offices. Which one do you prefer?,"With the advanced technology that makes remote working possible, many people can perform tasks at home, communicating with others simply via email, online networks and video conferencing. While some people argue that they prefer working at an office complex, I believe that working at home would be a better choose, for it can benefit employees, employers and society. Ċ For employees, working at home would save their considerable time. Without time-consuming travelling between office and home, white-collar workers will be able establish a balance between work and life. For example, single mothers, who is also an office lady, would be capable of taking care of their babies while working days. For business owners, the high operating costs can be reduced by the laissez-fair management. Thereby, employers can invest money in extending businesses, without having to pay skyrocketing rents in the Central Business Districts. Most importantly, with less commuters travelling and fewer demand of electricity in the metropolis, many social problems can be curbed. Undeniably, urban traffic congestion can be alleviated and carbon emission can be reduced, which is essential for economic and social sustainability. Ċ However, performing tasks in office block may have three merits. From psychological perspective, cooperating with colleagues can dispel loneliness and boredom. Having teammates accompany with, we will feel passionate and confident, with a high morale in a teamwork. Another benefit is that working together is a contributing factor in establishing organizational culture. If everyone are staying at home without a chance of face-to-face contact, each employee would be indifferent to colleagues and works. Lastly, working in office can enhance productivity. Compared with reliance on workers' self-discipline, managers can supervise work process directly, receive feedback immediately and execute tasks efficiently. Ċ From what has been discussed, although people may profit from working in offices, most of the people including employees, employers and citizens have benefited more from the policy of working at home."
9550,"Does Attractiveness and wealth equate remedy for success? Some people believe that success in life depends upon hard work and determination, while others believe that other factors like money and personal appearance are important.  Discuss both view and give your opinion?","Many people argue that appearance and wealth are directly linked to a success. Others believe that it can only depend on virtues like hard work and perseverance. My opinion is that success goes hand in hand with consistent work and determination. Ċ On one hand, money is seen as important, because it can provide us a good education. Since the childhood, we are constantly being told that attending a school and pursuing a secondary education are absolutely necessary in order to further succeed in life. Additionally, in our daily lives we are surrounded by advertisements promoting physical beauty, so that, unconsciously, we start associating success with physical attractiveness too. Ċ On the other hand, plenty of opportunities in the form of government subsidies and scholarships are provided today for students, who do not possess the means to pay for their higher education, but who have been doing working hard in their academics in high schools. This clearly shows that those who are determined and who work hard are judged by their merits and not by the amount of money they have. Ċ I strongly believe that there is a strong misconception that money and personal appearance are a path to success, because we live in a material world, where market economies demand us to consume more and more goods. However, although successful life might seem to depend on money and appearance, I believe that both of these factors are short-lasting and that only values like hard work and determination can lead to a successful life. Ċ Some people believe that success can be achieved through big pockets and personal looks. However, others rely on values such as hard work and determination. I believe that not everything can be bought and that strong efforts and true aspirations will always be required to achieve something worthy."
9551,"Some people believe that team sports are very important for children to succeed in their career, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is often argued by some that there are many advantages for children to play team sports to prepare for their future jobs while others do not agree. From my point of view, I do agree with this idea. In this essay, I will discuss both sides in detail. Ċ On the one hand, it is beneficial to offspring. To begin with, they can learn to cope with their peers. To illustrate this, they may face conflicts while playing physical activities as a team and they need to solve those by themselves. On top of that, They are able to learn time management skills. For example, because team sports are usually played at a certain time, they need to manage their time in order to win. Ċ On the other hand, some drawbacks may arise along with the aforementioned positive outcomes. Firstly, it may take up time for children to study basic subjects such as math, science, and history. As these are considered as the most important subject because they will be tested to enter universities, playing sports may lead parents to worry and be unsatisfied with their studies. Secondly, children may get injured by playing team spots. From my experience, I once sprained my ankle during a team sports game, and I needed to stay home for a week. Ċ To conclude, although there are some disadvantages, I personally believe that there are more benefits to kids. They are able to learn to cope with peers and time management skills. Therefore, I do believe that it is beneficial to kids and their future workplaces."
9552,"Schools should stop using books for teaching and instead use films, TV and computers. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Nowadays, many education centres switch the teaching method from books to multimedia. Those media, ranging from films to computers are widely used in schooling. Effective teaching attributes to rapid updates of database and eye-catching animation. I agree that schools should opt to utilise the media rather than books in terms of teaching. Ċ To commence with, the efficiency of using computers benefits from the updated databases. A database such as Wikipedia and other online dictionary websites are useful tools in assisting learning. Teachers are able to access this information easily with computers, as long as they are connected to the internet. In contrast, it always takes a very long time for the new publication of books. This shows a relative disadvantage of books compared with computers. Thus, it is clear that using computers in school for teaching ensures the knowledge that students acquired are the latest. Ċ Secondly, colourful animation results in the effective learning of students. Some topics, for example, anatomy and astronomy are usually difficult for them to understand sorely on papers. Because of this, they may have a more comprehensive understanding of the topics mentioned above. If there are a number of beautiful graphs and pictures, students often pay more attention in the lessons. Without a doubt, eye-catching presentation on films even 3D pictures on TV raise students interest in learning hence increase their learning effectiveness. Ċ In conclusion, with the aid of various media as teaching tools, the teaching and learning process will be more efficient and effective. Therefore, I support replacing books with films, TV and computers in schools."
9553,"Tourism is becoming increasingly important as a source of revenue to many countries, but its disadvantages should not be overlooked. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Traveller industry is in great demand in many countries. Although tourism helps the authority to earn a huge amount of money every year, but everyone should be aware about its disadvantages. I agree with the statement to some extent. Ċ On the one hand, tourism has a plethora of benefits to countries, travellers and locals. First and the foremost, all the tourists love to explore different countries for their culture and history. Therefore, they travel a lot to various sightseer places. In addition, it spreads the culture, like clothing, food and music of one location to another. Hence, more people are encouraged to visit such places and it could lead to a handsome revenue. Also, more earnings mean development and these funds are used to maintain the visitor attractions and also to build more places. Lastly, with this expanding industry, there are a large number of job opportunities for locals. Meanwhile, this employment results in overall development of all the countries. Ċ On the other hand, several drawbacks of tourism should not be ignored. Similarly, the first disadvantage is that it has a deleterious effect on the environment. As people through waste materials in their surroundings and due to lack of waste management, it spreads and cause soil pollution. Moreover, the establishment of new visitor places causes deforestation, which means felling of trees in forests. One of the crucial drawback is spreading of disease due to transmit of viruses. As visitors act like hotspots of some deadly diseases. For example, recently Coronavirus hit all over the world with its deadly effect and its mortality rate was too high. Ċ To conclude, in spite of disadvantages the traveller industry has many benefits that progressed the economy of countries, but the government should act to reduce the harmful effects of it in order to serve the humanity."
9554,"A country's future depends on it's young people. Therefore, a country should invest heavily in its youth. Do you agree or disagree?","There is a saying that goes ""children are the leaders of tomorrow"" Hence, countries are admonished to invest greatly in the young. In my opinion, I strongly agree with having to impact the younger generation and this essay will further discuss how this act can make a nation internationally recognised and how people can become better leaders in the years to come. Ċ Firstly, when the young are being invested into, they enable the country to be globally recognised. This can be explained in the sense that young adults who have undergone thorough grooming, through education, moral values as well as cultural ethics are enabled to build their own brands, which could be in the form of gadgets, textiles or even edibles. Therefore, creating a global identification for the nation as these goods is exported to other countries for use worldwide. For instance, my uncle was placed on scholarship from primary school through tertiary institution by the state government. He is a proud owner of several multinational companies today. This worldwide recognition, consequently, encourages the nation's economy to experience a significant increase. Ċ Also, investing in the younger generation by the country motivates youths to be responsible leaders. This is due to the fact that, being a leader comes with a lot of responsibilities. For example, in Nigeria, all university graduates are mandated to go through a compulsory one year of national service, where every individual is posted outside the confines of their homes and comforts to acquire skills and learn the cultural values of other tribes. This platform creates a form of awareness and respect within the individual. Therefore, allowing them to grasp the obligation that is attached to being a responsible leader later in life. Ċ To sum up, after analysing the points stated, it is clear that the impact of a country on the young adult paves way to becoming responsible elders and gives global recognition."
9555,"In the modern world, there are movements away from written exams to practical skills.Discuss advantages and disadvantages of this trend.","These days, besides written paper, many universities have been applying other forms of assessment like practical or oral testing. Both approaches of evaluating student ability are valid, but they test students in different ways. Ċ Some people claim that there are considerable benefits to be gained from written exams compared to practical testing methods. From the administrative point of view, this traditional method is easier to deal with. It is obvious that it is easier for teachers to mark their students based on the same examinations with fixed criteria. This is the reason why this form of assessment has existed for a long time and it has kept its popularity till now. However, written testing is criticized that it can not test overall skills of students. For example, practical skills like making quick decisions, functioning well in a team or delivering presentations can not be assessed through several written exams. In addition, sometimes, students achieve good results because they memorise knowledge rather than understand it. Ċ On the other hand, alternative assessment methods is believed to bring huge advantages and help to improve the ways of testing student ability. For example, in some Master Business Administrative programs, students are asked to give presentations or work in a team and solve problems together. Through these practices, teachers can assess the team work and problem-solving skills of their students. They are essential skills for most business employees who want to be successful in career prospects. Therefore, it makes sense to test in the same ways. Furthermore, by doing practical exercises, students will be familiar with practice and the requirements of work, so they will be well prepared for the profession in the future. Ċ In conclusion, although written exams are still popular because it is easy apply, a range of practical methods are gradually becoming more common. The new assessment help to test some skills that can not be tested through the former method."
9556,You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. Ċ To what extent do you agree? Ċ You should write at least 254 words.,"The media these days is following celebrities more than ever before. Some people think this may have a harmful impression on adolescents. However, I am of the belief that it is not as straight forward as it looks. Ċ To begin with, negative coverage of celebrities can cause several issues for the children. The media industry these days seems to be more interested in the newsworthy shortcomings than the true and complete picture, which makes their fans, especially the young ones, more depressed and concerned. For example, in India, the excessive coverage of S S Rajput's suicide had caused emotional breakdowns in several schools. Next, the celebrities are quite influential and their expensive habits cause youth to walk on a dark path. In the urge to wanting-to-be like their favourite figures, kids in my country have gone as far as stealing from their parents just to buy that one outfit or jewellery. Ċ In contrast, we can also witness some positive influences from these entertainers. Youngsters look up to their favourite celebrities and want to become like them. Furthermore, their success provides the children with much-needed inspiration and motivation to achieve more in their lives. For instance, several great artists, actors and sportspersons have dedicated their success to their counterparts, they have followed growing up, in their respective fields. Additionally, these entertainers pave the path and become the guiding light for future generations by showing the rules of behaviour. Owing to their mistakes youth learns what to avoid and get to see what is possible from their achievements. Ċ In conclusion, it seems that the effect really depends on the mindset of the person who consumes the information on their role model. Where some may get negatively influenced, others seem to have turned it into the fuel for their flight. Having said that, if the media focuses on positive things as well, it may offset the negative consequences."
9557,"What distinguishes young people from their parents' or grandparents' generation is a lack of physical exercise. Today's generation are spending far too long playing computer games, chatting aimlessly on social networking sites or simply watching TV, and too little time being active. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the digital age, Some individuals have been believed that the current generations spent their leisure time far too long playing games, communicating with their comrades on social platforms, binge-watching TV shows instead of doing outdoor activities, especially physical exercises, leading to distinguishing youngsters from their parents and elderly people. Personally, I disagree with this statement as there are many effective indoor activities. Ċ Firstly, nowadays, children not only spend their time on useless activities but also on studying purposes due to the pandemic, which did not allow youngsters to gain an acknowledgement of academics at the institute. Consequently, Studying online is the main crucial purpose of using the computer in the current era. Moreover, some adolescents utilised far more computers in order to gain extra knowledge, which is unable to study at the school such as learning other languages and content editing. For example, youngsters who want to be YouTubers tend to spend most of their free hours learning approaches online. Ċ Secondly, Nowadays, games are far more developed in various ways in order to improve children's habits and physical health by installing and connecting special equipment with the game consoles. For instance, the Fit Ring, which is brand new exercise equipment, allows offspring to do a wide range of healthy exercises inside their accommodation without concerning about dangers from germs and transportation. Additionally, They have to work out intensively to pass the higher levels and success in that game. Furthermore, Parents can join in these games to interact with their offspring and built up family bonds. Ċ In conclusion, While spending time on social networks, which leads to lessening their physical health, there are some playful innovations that gather parents and individuals at a young age and work out together simultaneously."
9558,Some people opine that cinema will eventually lose its appeal to mass people and very few people will go to cinema halls. Ċ Do you agree or disagree with this view?,"It is considered by some that movie theatre will gradually lose customers and it is predicted that only the minority who are going to visit since there are many other activities and platforms which substitute the role of cinema as a convenient place to release stress. In my view, the popularity of movie house would be replaced by state-of-the-art technology and other pleasant leisure activities. Ċ Generally speaking, the popularity of movie house as the most popular place to visit during the weekend has been declining because of globalisation in the last decade. In fact, a plethora of multicultural cafes and restaurants are established in the city centre, hence, society these days have a wide variety of options on how they spend their spare time with their family and friends. This is what I usually do with my spouse and children in spending our family time together at the end of the week, and it gives us a new experience on foreign cuisines, such as Italian food. Ċ Moreover, sooner or later the cinema will be fully replaced by state-of-the-art technology which had been bringing numerous advantages to our daily life. In fact, it is inevitable that community are always seeking the most convenient and the cheapest way to do a particular action. In other words, we prefer going online and watch movies through various platforms than going to the cinema. For instance, millennials prefer to stay at home and spend their short holiday watching drama series and films on Netflix. Therefore, it is inevitable that this trend will continue to grow and substitute the main purpose of a movie theatre. Ċ To sum up, as far as I am concerned, fewer people go to the cinema nowadays and it will lose its attractiveness in the future given that globalisation has had brought a significant change in the way people enjoy their habit as well as advanced technology which enables people in watching a variety of film more convenient and low-cost. If this condition is going to continue, there will be no cinema in the near future."
9559,Countries should restrict foreign companies from opening offices and factories in order to protect local businesses. Ċ Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.,"When there are enough resources in a country, Multinational companies tend to set up their trade centres, Which play a vital role in a nation's economy. Some individuals are claiming that other land's firms should not be allowed at own country to start out their stations and manufacturing plants because it is harmful to inside businesses. I totally disagree with this elucidation because out of country investors bring the latest technologies and create a more skilled workforce. Ċ To begin with, Why I am saying that a country should allow other countries companies to execute their trade because they will install brand new automation. Since multinational operating firms have more budgets to do research on new processes which are cost-effective and more time-saving. Furthermore, They can make more money out in the market and in return will pay more taxes to the government. To cite an example, The Haliburton Middle east put new drilling techno in Saudi Arabia in 2020 which has increased the production capacity of oil by 20%. Ċ Secondly, The Other reason for supporting this statement is that authorities should permit other firms is because by doing so it can make more well-rounded staff. Moreover, Various nation based firms have vast training facilities in which they are trained their employees in the presence of more experienced trainers. Besides this they have placements programmes through which they rotate their working people, So they can groom more and learn new things which enhance their knowledge horizons. To illustrate, Mole Pakistan is a Germany based natural gas processing company which every two years relocate their staff members in different countries. Ċ To sum up, I reiterate that other countries firms should be allowed this is because they will deliver more plus points in terms of new engineering sciences equipment and produce more trained workforce. Given this situation, It seems that stakeholders should facilitate such firms and devote a more friendly environment to start out their companies."
9560,Nowadays older people often live in retirement homes with people of their own age instead of living with their children. Is it a positive or negative development?,"It is well-known that individuals of great age in the majority of cases stay in care establishments with their peers these days rather than living with their offspring. This essay firmly states that this tendency is for the better. I do believe that aged people are less likely to get stressed when they have opportunities to communicate and spend more time with friends of their own age. Ċ Aged parents tend to be depressed because of a lack of attention when they live with their children. In most cases, adult children are preoccupied with their job and raising up their own families while pensioners require care and acknowledgement in order to avoid a feeling of loneliness. For example, my grandfather grabbed a lot of my mother’s time just because he wanted to chat about anything but my mother had to work at the same time and as a result, this bothering caused many mistakes in her performance. In other words, if an aged individual has a chance to spend more time with one’s friends, one will be happier. Ċ On another side of this statement, if a person of retirement age experiences some disorders or disabilities that claim some specific care with special equipment. People might have serious health issues by the great age such as disability to eat on ones own or difficulty walking without help. At this point, they have to be supplied with special appliances and care. For instance, back to my grandfather, he couldn’t walk without help and special poles and also needed a specific medical check every day furthermore these needs were met in a care house. Ċ 	To conclude, in the majority of cases, people who are retired will feel much better among their friends in a specifically facilitated environment than with their children who have already their own families and have to dedicate more time to nurturing their toddlers."
9561,"The unlimited use of cars caused many problems. What are those problems? In order to reduce the problems, should we discourage people to use cars? the great number of vehicles on roads and its impact","It is undeniable that private cars has brought a great deal of travelling convenience. However, the widespread of car use has led to some serious environmental issues, causing detrimental effects on our health and life quality. Therefore, there is no doubt that car restriction is considered as an effective measure to control the problems. Ċ First of all, cars are the primary cause for the air pollution which makes people vulnerable to many diseases. Exhausts emitting from automobiles contains a great number of harmful particles being stuck in our lungs and causing cancers. In addition, these substances are considered as a main reason for human gene modification, leading to fatal impact on the existence of the mankind. Ċ Furthermore, the more private cars people use, the more pressure there is on the parking lots. Instead of saving land for botanic gardens or parks, more land is being used for parking areas. This to some extend has resulted in negative effects on our life quality. People do not have enough green places and fresh atmosphere which are vital elements to maintain their welfare. Ċ In order to alleviate the problems, a restriction on car use definitely can be seen as an effective medium. For one thing, the use more eco-friendly means of transport will help reduce global warming emissions, leaving a cleaner and purer atmosphere. This can attribute to curbing diseases related to poor air quality. For another thing, more space designated for natural habitats will encourage people's participation in physical activities like cycling, walking or jogging. An active lifestyle will spread among the community and improve our living standards. Ċ In conclusion, even though automobiles are thought to be an advantageous form of transport, their popularity is still causing hazardous environmental impacts on people's life physically and mentally. Therefore, with car reduction, we can completely expect a better life quality."
9562,Some people think that government should spend money on railways. Others believe that there should be more investment into new roads. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion,"Throughout history, humans have used various modes of transportation to commute and for trading. However, while some believe that investment in railways and trains should be the priority of the government, I side with those who think that investment should be focused on new roads and tracks. Ċ On the one hand, it is argued that the state should allocate more finances for railways. According to them, the biggest advantage of railways is that it is comparatively more affordable than other modes of transportation as trains cater to a larger section of the public, who cannot afford to have their cars or bikes. According to an economic survey, a person using trains for his daily commute to his work spends one-fifth of the fuel cost incurred by a person using his car in the same distance. Moreover, trains are believed to have a lower risk of accidents than vehicles running on roads, for they have separate tracks for themselves. Ċ On the other hand, I agree with those who believe that investments on roads are more important than on railways. In my opinion, roads are used not just by public vehicles such as buses and taxis, but private vehicles alike. Unlike railways, better roads are also beneficial for those who do not prefer to use public transport as their daily commute. Furthermore, I feel that the greatest benefit of a good road network is its role in promoting trade and consequently, contribution to the development of the economy. Countries having well-developed road networks are usually seen to have a better economy. For instance, with proper roads, farmers would be able to transfer their goods from farms to the market in a shorter time. Ċ To conclude, although the railway is generally cheaper for the masses, roads help in boosting trade and the economic development of the country. Therefore, on balance, I firmly believe that the government should prioritize and spend more on the development of road networks."
9563,"In light of the current socio-economic situation of the world, do you think this the right time for wildlife preservation? If yes, what are the ways and means you suggest for this?"" Give your opinion in no less than 250 words. the preservation of nature issue","Wildlife preservation is debatable issue in present world. While social-economic condition has been demanding more natural resources to address increased population needs, healthy eco-system is also needed for continued existence of them. I assert that wildlife preservation is an alarming issue for human survival, and there are various potential ways to preserve this. Ċ Protecting wild plant and animal species and their habitats is indispensable for every aspect of human life. If the excessive use of the resources is going on as to socio-economic demand, the nature then will be disruptive for future generation. For instance, various electrical power plants are already situated in wild places by removing numerous forest and hills, and the effects of such removal is contributing to the global warming. For this reason, the preservation of wild life is a crucial subject in order to save our nature in the present time. Ċ Nevertheless, when the protection of wildlife is concerned, there are potential solutions to be offered to resolve this. Despite of environmental awareness, no steps can work effectively, so raising awareness among people will be effective one of possible solution. And then policy maker can implement restrictions against the use of natural resources. Finally, instead of using fossil fuels, alternatives such as Plant-derived plastics, biodiesel, wind power and solar power can be introduced to reserve those fuels from running out soon. Thus, it is not impossible to preserve wild life in a right manner. Ċ To conclude, whereas the condition of socio-economy is noteworthy for most of people, the preservation of nature is also unavoidable. Considering these view, I m realizing that wildlife should be protected. Some steps like awareness, imposing strong law, renewable energy is magnificent option to address the concerning issue."
9564,Recently published figures show that the wildlife population around the world has decreased by around fifty per cent over the last fifty years. What can we do to help protect the wildlife round the world?,"Experts throughout the world have debated how to protect species from extinction. Over and above this, the substantial importance of being environmentally friendly has sparked in recent years. Additionally, humans must have a responsible attitude to preserve the world. Ċ At the outset, there are numerous ways to protect wildlife, but the most successful is sustainable exploration. This comprises extracting a certain limit of raw materials from the forest, allowing it not to disrupt the natural food chain. When there is a disbalance, the overpopulation of some animals can certainly overwhelm the existence of others. For example, after a vast number of rabbits were hunted in the 15th century, the population of lions decreased, and consequently, less food for mankind. For this reason, people can not take from the forest as much as they want. Ċ Nevertheless, some drawbacks about the impact on human life remain, and some people believe there are no consequences to humanity due to nature damage. However, looking at carbon footprint as a dysregulation among human production and plants consumption, climate change happens, so floods and droughts around the globe kill societies. For instance, some researches show that unless civilians start a net-zero carbon dioxide policy, there will be even human beings living on Earth in the next ten years. In this way, to preserve other species and themselves, the population must stop depending on fossil fuel as soon as possible by replacing it with renewable energy. Ċ To conclude, wildlife preservation is not just a solitary action, but it is a question of whether human beings will survive. As a result, humankind must explore without disrupting the chain, also decrease the usage of coal and oil."
9565,"Some people think that children should be studying all the mandatory subjects until the age of ten, while others believe they should have an option to select favourite subjects to study. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience. subjects choice for children","Some people believe children before ten years old could choose the subjects what they are interested because it's the best to learn anything. However, in my perspective, children should learn mandatory subjects firstly and then they have more choices to select the favorite subjects in the future. Ċ Young children have great learning abilities to obtain knowledge quickly. Instead of spending time on what they are interested, they should focus on general subjects such as mathematics, language, science, history, and geography. Knowing how the world works is important to prepare them to communicate and cooperate with other people. For instance, a child just likes to study math but he abandons language course. Although he is extremely talented in math, he couldn't find a job because of lack of communication skills. If they don't study basic subject such as geography, they don't even know the geography their own country and even the whole picture of the world. How do they survive without basic knowledge? Ċ In majority children, they don't know their favorite subjects so learning mandatory subjects is great access to inspire the main stuffs they would like to develop.Nevertheless, if the children have passion on specific subjects, there are lots of methods to approach it. Firstly, they can take up after class time to study it. Secondly, joining some school's clubs is a way to extend their enthusiasm. Finally, consolidation on basic knowledge is beneficial for them to get more selection in the future. Ċ In summary, compared to select the favorite subjects, studying mandatory provide more opportunities for children when they are in the age they can choose."
9566,You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Write about the following topic: Ċ Nowadays we are producing more and more rubbish. Ċ Why do you think this is happening? Ċ What can governments do to help reduce the amount of rubbish produced? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 254 words.,"Advancements in disposable packaging in recent years have really increased the amount of trash we produce as a collective global society. From soft drinks to your daily grocery items, all come in cheap packings. This essay will further elaborate the reasons behind this issue and discuss the ways authorities can help reduce it. Ċ I think the improvements in the use of plastic as packaging material has caused the rise of garbage in recent years. On the one hand, it is the advancements in the manufacturing process that has reduced the cost significantly. Perhaps so significant that most companies are now choosing plastic over another easily reusable, but expensive, materials. To illustrate, It was not too long ago when soft drinks only used to come in glass bottles. On the other hand, it has promoted the use of readily available products, which were not possible to package for longer periods of time before the improvements, such as, half cooked meals. Ċ Governments can take several actions to control the production of trash. One way to tackle the issue is by banning the usage of cheap polythene bags over promoting better quality reusable ones. Consequently, it will reduce the number of low quality bags going out in the trash. For example, In Italy most people bring their own reusable bags to the grocery stores. Additionally, one can even buy products like detergent and soups in their own glass jars. Another way could be by incentivising the collection of recyclable containers, like plastic bottles. For instance, In Germany, if the consumers bring back their used bottles to the shop they purchased it from, they get a certain percentage of the price back. Ċ In conclusion, I think we have become a rubbish producing society because of the advancements in technology. However, governments can play a significant role by forming regulations that can make it harder for brands and consumers to produce more rubbish."
9567,"People have different job expectations for jobs. Some people prefer to do the same job for the same company, whereas others prefer to change jobs frequently.  Write about the advantages and disadvantages of each viewpoint?","A popular belief is that ""we work for a life"". Some people prefer to change their job, while others would not like to do that. In my essay I will explore benefits and drawbacks of the above attitude. Ċ To begin with, the main benefit of staying in last job is sense of stability. The Exxon Mobil workers, for instance, who have been working for 30 years, have a stable high income, social company's support and they are sure in the future. In contrast, the group of people, changing their preference in jobs frequently, has to find their new apartment, change their place of life. Ċ Secondly, mature company's workers have a huge experience and background in their branch, while persons, which change their job, do not have one. Ċ However, there are some advantages of changing jobs. One of them is people can establish new contacts, that can help them in their career growth. Another one is new job can not be boring for you, while old one can. And people, who worked in different ways, have a broad range of useful skills. Ċ To sum up, there are benefits and drawbacks of changing a job, which depend on specific situation. On the one hand, if worker has a stable interesting job with a high salary, good social support and good relationship between other people in his/her team, there are no reasons to find a new one. On the other hand, a new job can help to establish a new contact, not to be bore."
9568,"Some people think watching TV is bad for children, while others think that watching TV has more beneficial effects on children. Ċ Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.","It is common that enormous adults are worried about the negative influences of watching televisions on young generations. And also, another group of persons hold an optimist thought towards this phenomenon. From my point of view, I believe that watching the tube can bring both merits and disadvantages to the boys and girls, and the reasons will be presented below. Ċ On the one hand, the priority con of watching the box is that children’s mental health might be adversely influenced by some TV programs since children can not select and distinguish what knowledge is suitable for them to watch. This means a considerable large amount of TV programs aimed at no specific audiences, and the programs which contain pornography and violence contents might be seen by young individuals. It will lead to the imitation of unlawful behaviours in the shows among young generations such as fighting, digging drugs and rape. In China, for instance, since there is no rating system to denote a TV series’ suitability for certain age-groups. Chinese young generations are eligible to watch any bloody or violent programs without companions. This might explain why the crime rate of juvenile offenders in China are remaining the growth in recent decades. Therefore, it is important to establish the censorship system to guarantee the quality and values of the tv programmes for young generations. Ċ On the other hand, it is also undeniable that the stunning and colourful images on TV can dramatically stimulate kids’ interests in learning, and also it can help children to remember more information. A report of the Times showed, compared with traditional textbooks and lectures, visualizations of knowledge on TV can provide mixtures of information which substantially help individuals to possess an improvement on their memorizing of knowledge. Besides that, the memories with images can last longer than literal information. In this case, educational and inspirational tv programmes can be encouraged to broadcast among kids. Because it seems that watching proper shows can bring plenty of benefits to children’s studying. Ċ In conclusion, even though there is much controversy about whether children are beneficial from watching tv. In my opinion, I think it can be both harmful and advantageous to young generations. Hence, it is crucial that children are watching educational and suitable tv shows instead of restricted-rated programs."
9569,Some people believe that young people know about international pop and movie stars but know very less about famous people from the history in their own country.Why is this ? How can more interest be created in young generation to gain more knowledge about their famous people from history?,"While some individuals think that our young generation is quite familiar with the international celebrities, their knowledge about the history of their nation is extremely small.The main reason for this phenomenon is that they find historical facts boring and a mere wastage of time.The possible way to create their interest is by the presentation of such things in an interesting way and more beautifully. Ċ To commence with, the major cause of this process is the boredom associated with the learning of history, and furthermore, their perspective of considering it as not useful.Since from the beginning of the school life, teachers also do not take so much interest in teaching the past of famous people, and even they put emphasis on rote learning, therefore children might consider themselves unfit for studying social science.In India, for instance, teaching system is based on the theoretical concepts and no practical knowledge is provided to the students, which in turn, has lead to the lesser interest of the younger children towards the history.This way teaching methods are responsible for the poor condition of this subject. Ċ There are several ways to alleviate this problem.First of all, the teaching methods should be modified and more practical methods should be adopted to enhance the inclination of pupils towards the history of their own country rather than focusing on the multinational celebs.If students are motivated to learn about the struggle of great freedom fighters and persons involved in making the constitution of the nation, then it will ultimately inclined them in order to take inspiration from them instead of avoiding their biographies.For example, educational institutes can organise tours of the national museums of arts and history where they will get plenty of evidence regarding the previous conditions of the nation.To elucidate, modification in the way of teaching can help to stimulate the growth of history related aspects. Ċ In conclusion, although a vast majority of people consider that children are keen to gather information of pop and movie stars, and they have little interest in history of celebrities in their own country.This essay discussed the reasons for the current situation which includes the boring teaching methods and possible solution to rectify this process."
9570,Many cities have become less pleasant places to live in recent years. What do you think are the causes of this? What solutions can you suggest?,"In the past people could go to travel, live or work everywhere they wanted, unfortunately, nowadays some country's cities getting worse. People are frightening to go there for traveling or for dwelling. there are some problems which should be solved in order to improve cities' condition. Ċ In my opinion, the first problem is air pollution in the cities. Nowadays, there are an immense of cars and factories which can produce the smog in the cities. It can cause to people in very high level. For example, they can aggravate bronchitis and may even cause cancer. Some people suffer from breathing or other health problems. Elderly people do not feel safe in their homes. So that is why, people are not going to live or move to the metropolises. Ċ To solve this trouble we have to reduce waste disposals, driving cars, producing less chemicals and industries which are released the worst one. For instance, when coal is burnt in power stations to give electricity, it produces two major gases which cause acid rain. Ċ The second one is unfriendliness which is the worst habit in our life. When people move to like this place, they feel lonely and some strange. Neighbors do not speak to each other or do not help each other. It is too boring live like these places. In my view, everyone should be more attentive to each other. For example, if your neighbor is new there where you live, you have to help them concentrate on to this place. Ċ To sum up, all countries should be more attentive to their cities. They need to create new places for people who are arriving there and build new houses for people who are moving there."
9571,Many countries face the problem of low voter turnout in their democratic elections. What are the problems associated with it and suggest solutions?,"Voting is the civil right of all the citizens of the nation through which they can elect a deserving ruling party. However,Low voter turnout is a common problem worldwide in democratic elections because of apathy in politics and mistrust in the government.This essay shall throw light on the issues associated with a decrease in voting and possible remedies to solve them. Ċ Firstly, because of low voter turnout in polls, there are high chances of electing an ineligible candidate who may be biased or can misuse the power. Therefore ,affecting the democracy of the country.Hence, people have to face the consequences of not participating in the ballot. For instance,India is a democratic country with multiple religions in minority and if an unfair candidate is given the power he may try to create communal tension in the society.Secondly, ruling governance has the right to change the budget and laws thus, affecting the economy of the nation.Moreover, In the hands of unloyal authorities, the rich and poor gap increases, as the rich will become richer with the help of the government and the poor community suffers the brunt of a hike in basic commodities and lead a difficult life. Ċ Nevertheless, the problem of low voting in polls can be solved by applying certain measures such as conducting awareness programmes regarding elections,campaigning by political parties so that the common public will get to know their party motives and agendas.Additionally, gaining peoples confidence by keeping their promises will involve people in polls.For example, if the same candidate contests for the second time ,he will be judged by the promises he made and how much he has fulfilled in his entire term of being in power.Furthermore, making special arrangements for rural and disabled people will be beneficial. What's more, keeping elections on public holidays will also increase the voter's turnout. Ċ In conclusion, low voting on ballots is due to disenchantment and apathy in political parties.Nonetheless, this can be solved by effective campaigning and gaining the trust of the public as this will help in electing a well-deserving party that will be in favour of improving the economy and helping the public."
9572,The internet is the best way to know about different things around the world. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?,"Technology had a great leap in the past century with many cutting-edge inventions, including the Internet. With the Net, details about things around the world are at human's disposal, thus it is widely regarded as the best method of learning something. Personally, while it is true that there are other ways to learn such matters, I totally subscribe to this statement. This essay will prove why the Net is the best source of education before reaching a reasoned conclusion. Ċ Firstly, the Net opens doorways to a wealth of information, knowledge and educational resources. It increases opportunities for learning in and beyond the classroom. For example, teachers use online materials to prepare lessons, and students to extend their range of learning. Another example is that pupils can use the Web for additional clues of certain subjects after class, such as: why fire casts light but not shadows. Ċ Secondly, the Internet provides a much faster and easier way to acquire materials than any other media. For instance, news on papers and TVs is only published at a fixed time. Daily paper only report to people about the previous day, so they have to wait a day to learn about such things. Television conveys the details more quickly as they are broadcast in various time frames. However, unlike them, World Wide Web has information updated frequently and available 24/7. Therefore, people can access it everywhen and everywhere, given that there is a connection. That's why the network is the top choice for educating oneself. Ċ To summarize, the Internet is a useful learning tool with a patently obvious superiority over other methods. Consequently, it is agreed that the best way to know about things is via the network. After thorough analysis on this subject, it is still better to learn through various means since some information can be missed on the Net."
9573,"""Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Students learn better when they are not threatened with possible failure. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.""","Everybody might not find learning easier. The process or methodologies of learning differ from person to person. Some student might get better off with learning when they realize about the possible failure where as some might get nervous and might do worse than expected. I believe a student should be told about every aspect of life, even failure but they should not be threatened other wise instead of motivating they get demotivated. Ċ Not every individual in the universe are same, regarding this fact the way some student get motivated might be different form other students. Some students might find failure a impetus. Whenever they realize of a possible failure their body fills them with adrenalin which gives them energy to overcome any impedance. But for other, like me , failure means the end. Instead of getting motivate i get panic and my body functions differently and abnormally which hinders my learning whenever i am threatened with failure. Ċ Similarly, for most of procrastinator, failure might be a ringing bell. They start do much better and fills them with self motivation and self discipline when they think of the deadline or are threatened with failure. For example, one of my friend who was a master procrastinator and never submitted his assignment in time when threatened by a teacher of lower grade unexpectedly submitted all his work on time. But on the other hand, for some people instead of threatening them they should be told politely and in a good manner to help them learn much better especially a student like me. Ċ So, at last, i would like to say that, when threatened with failure some might find it helpful. Personally, for me, i learn better if i am, handled with love and care rather than showing me the fear of failure or threatening me."
9574,It is generally agreed that society benefits from the work of its memebers. Compare the contributions of artists to society with the contributions of scientists to society. Which type of contribution do you think is valued more by your society? Give specific reasons to support your answer.,"Art provides a lot of benefits and improvements to our society. On the one hand, art enhaces the beauty of our country through masterpieces such as paintings, scultures, and magnificent buildings. On the other hand, art is a vehicle for communication and push minds to think and reflect in order to create an aware society. Moreover, art stimulates our imagination and it could be a space in which our minds can escape from this noisy and complicated world. Ċ Scientists as well as art have played a crucial role in the society. Their contributions have improved our life'styles, health, and technology. Scientists' discoveries help us in many ways, not only broadening our knowledge, but making our day to day lives easier and confortable. Ċ For what concerns my country, I believe that art is valued more by the society as nowadays Italy is more known and famous for arts, fashion, cinema, and design rather than his scientists. For example, Renzo Piano is a master in the architecture in all over the world, as well as Valentino, Dolce&Gabbana, Armani in the fashion. Our brands in these fields are exported abroad and many people admire and imitate our works. As other result, Italy have a lot of tourists every year who come here to look up personally our gems and beauties of excellent and unique artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Bernini, Caravaggio. Still now, art is considered more important than scientist. That is proved by the goverment who invests more money to preserve art rather than to put money in scientists' researches. Ċ In conclusion, for all these reasons, I believe that my society consider more estimated art as people are educated to appreciate it and they can experience art every day. People should protect their beauties and be proud of them."
9575,Many people believe that women make better parents than men and that this is why they have the greater role in raising children in most societies. Others claim that men are just as good as women at parenting. Write an essay expressing your point of view.,"Throughout the history women has proven to be a better parent in raising a child. However, this does not eliminate the fact that fathers role is not equally important as women. It seems to me women make better parent than men in raising their children. This will be proven by looking at ability of the women to be patient and good communicator than men. Ċ For one, it is felt than women tend to be patient and less aggressive than men. For example, by look at the history of war and crime it is evident that men are proven to be more aggressive than women. Apparently, when raising a child, parents are encouraged to undertake gentle manner as this will have positive influence on them. Thus, it is evident that women are less aggressive and gentle than men Ċ In addition to the above, it is a common fact that women posses the quality of good communication and intelligence. For instance, studies from UK revealed, there is a greater dominance by female candidates who tend to outperform the male candidates in aptitude and communication test. It is evident from this example that women are proven to be an excellent communicator and intelligent than men, when it comes to looking after the children. Therefore, through proper communication and understanding , mother plays a greater role influencing a child. Ċ In summary, it can be concluded that the quality of a women being less aggressive and good communicator makes it a better parent, despite men's role in rearing a child are equally important as women."
9576,The prevention of health problems and illness is more important than treatment and medicine. Government funding should reflect this. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is often argued that mitigating health issues and diseases is better than treating them, hence the government should allocate appropriate budgets for it. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this view. Ċ To begin with, following a healthy lifestyle, such as eating the right food, as well as keeping fit and staying in shape is certainly beneficial to fitness and preventing illness. Nonetheless, there are some diseases that are incurable and occur based on genetics, such as cancer. For example, my grandfather led an active and healthy lifestyle, did not smoke and had a good diet, however, he developed lung cancer when he was 65 years old. Therefore, I hold the view that finding new ways to treat these kinds of illness is in need of consistent funding which the ministry has a responsibility to budget for. Ċ Secondly, in many countries, there is a desperate need for investment in health care, especially for the development of new ways to combat serious disease such  as Parkinson's disease. To illustrate this, in the USA over the past two decades, there have been huge advances in the treatment of Parkinson's with new types of drug, which was the result of several years of investment by administrations. If the regime in other countries had this at the top of their agenda then I believe that many more terrible illnesses could ne cured by cutting edge medicine with the next decade. Ċ To sum up, although some argued that authority money needs to be set aside for the prevention of well-being problems rather than pharmaceutical and treatment. I firmly believe that funds need to be used for the treatment of serious diseases and the improvement of better pharmaceutical."
9577,"Can someone help me with my essay? Here's the question: What led you to choose the area(s) of academic interest that you have listed in your application to the University of Michigan? If you are undecided, what areas are you most interested in, and why?","History and science - my first true loves. And of course they were my first loves because they had taught me what and how. Yet, as my academic journey moved on from global to American, from biology to chemistry I felt unsatisfied with what and how - I wanted to know why. Ċ Anthropology? What was that? At the time, when I had first heard of it, I didn't even know what it was and it certainly sounded lime something farfetched. My friend had mentioned it to me after having taken a career oriented survey and the list included anthropology. Out of curiosity that same night, I looked it up and I realized that I had found what I wanted, the answer to my whys in life. Ċ So I took on classes and fell even deeper in love with the subject that offered me the understanding of civilizations, of societies, of people. It offered me an area of study so interdisciplinary that I would never lose interest -combinations that ranged from genetics to culture to language to media. Ċ It was a perfect combination of both the physical sciences and the liberal arts. Investigation would be limitless and there were so many options and alternatives for me to choose from. Anthropology was my yin and yang - it was the academic balance I craved for and wish to indulge in. It is the balance that is represented in nature because life itself is interdisciplinary...why should my life and love be any different?"
9578,"In countries where there is high unemployment, most pupils should be offered only primary education. There is no point in offering secondary education to those who will have no hope of finding a job. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Education play a vital role in improving human's well-being, and livelihood. However, some individuals opine that high school is not needed in some particular public, where the rate of the crowd who are unemployed is high as ,finally they cannot find a job, while my opinion contradicts with this statement. This essay will elaborate on the reason to support my perspective. Ċ For individuals, children should continue higher schooling for gaining a better opportunity for getting a job despite high the unemployment rate. As outstanding qualifications from higher education, these students have a better chance to be recruited by prestigious companies compared to people who just graduated from primary school. For example, SCG company limited, the largest company producing constructing material in Thailand, always select an employee from their educational background. Therefore, the one who has a higher degree of study will always be chosen for work. Ċ For the nation, human resources play an important role in developing the country that is why Europe, which emphasizes learning for their young population, has been identified as the developed country, whereas, Thailand is considered a developing country which their people struggle to find food to put on the table. With educated people, useful innovation, and genius technology are created to enhance the nation and well-being. Without the proper education, all these things will never happen. Hence, knowledge is crucial for driving and enhancing the nation. Ċ In conclusion, although the hope of getting a job in some countries is very less, my perspective strongly disagrees with the statement because schooling provides people with a chance to pursue a better life, and the nation cannot be developed without those educated people."
9579,The government should pay the cost of the course to everyone who wants to study at the university. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Getting an education is one of life’s important milestones. It is the responsibility of the government to pay the course fee for those who are looking to study at the university. While I agree that it provides an opportunity to all the people, I also believe that individual contribution is essential. Ċ On the one hand, institution fees by the government lead to an increase in the number of pupils joining university. Low income or poor people cannot afford to pay academic amounts; hence many students fail to continue higher studies. If funds are raised by the government authorities, it provides equal opportunity and access to the studies they want. For example, many countries provide free schooling and it increases the literacy rate. Same way, if universities funded by the government, more and more people become graduates. As a result, the economy gets boosted, and it helps the society become wealthy. Ċ On the other hand, individual contribution is an important factor for better involvement in studies. This can create great involvement and seriousness towards the education. If students get sponsors from someone, it is difficult to find enthusiasm towards the course. For instance, authorities can introduce a scheme to reduce fees. In addition, the course fee can be decided based on the earlier academic results. Therefore, self-discipline improves, and each person works hard to become a successful person in life. Ċ In conclusion, although government funds help most of the aspirants to continue their education, it is essential for individual contribution as well to motivate young adults. It is everyone’s responsibility to pay attention to their future career."
9580,Topic - The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans . Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages,"Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached. Ċ It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs . It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity .So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects . Ċ On other side of the coin , many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome. Ċ After analyzing these two points of view , it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy . Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free ."
9581,"In some countries, shopping online is replacing shopping at store. Discuss both the pros and cons of this trend?","In recent days, the question of whether e-commerce is replacing traditional stores or not has been receiving a great deal of public attention. Although online shopping is not without disadvantages, the upsides will overshadow these. Ċ On the one hand, shopping online has some downsides. First, since online stores can not offer customers physical senses experience such as touching or smelling, customers find it hard to trust enough to place a purchase decision. In fact, there are thousands of scam stores that offer fake or poor quality products which leads to customers' frustration. Second, by shopping over the Internet, buyers are likely to be victimized by online fraud. This means that private information or banking accounts are hacked via electrical transactions, which dangers victims' private life since hackers take advantage to blackmail customers or steal their identity. Ċ On the other hand, an array of merits of e-commerce platforms can be identified. First, since online shopping does not require physical travel to purchase a single item and offer door-to-door service, it is such a time-saving and quick way. For instance, busy workers can make buying decisions with a mouse-click away without scrolling at stores, which saves time to get more done. Second, the vast amount of information available through the Internet enables customers to use this channel to evaluate the merchandise before making purchase decisions. This means that customers can consult buying reviews from other previous buyers which are considered less biased than sellers' information, which helps them to make wise decisions. Ċ In conclusion, the upsides of e-commerce will overshadow the downsides. By considering all the pros and cons, people will make the best decisions for themselves."
9582,1)	Both the poor and the rich find the accessibility into university difficult. Do you agree or disagree?,"As time goes by, the importance of being educated increases, which requires all people to get a university education. However, most of the people are unable to enter the university, even those who have enough money sometimes face another sort of difficulties. I completely agree with this statement due to many different reasons. Ċ The accessibility into university is becoming more and more difficult due to some reasons. First of all, the fees of the universities are increasing rapidly, causing a lot of obstacles for those who do not have enough money. In addition, some rich people think that it is a waste if they spent most of their money for education only when they have the ability to spend it in more interesting things like travelling or establishing companies. Hence, the number of people who have given up entering college due to this reason has increased. Ċ The second main reason is the amount of requirements which are needed to enter the college, which is something difficult for both poor and rich people. Because universities no longer depend only on the high school certificate, student started to give up their dreams because they need to work too hard in order to achieve all the requirements in addition to getting high average in the high school. For example, most of the colleges currently require the student to get high marks in IELTS and ACT in addition to their school exams, also, they only allocate school seats for citizens, while others have to submit many documents to be accepted. Thus, poor and rich student has started to avoid universities that ask for too much requirements. Ċ In conclusion, although some people think that rich persons have the ability to enter the school easily, I believe that it is hard for both poor and rich due to the high fees and the number of requirements they need. So it is something important to make it easier for the student to educate in order to line up with the new developments."
9583,"As computers translate quickly and accurately, learning foreign languages is a waste of time.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In recent years, the translation system has grown with technological evolution. This progress proves quickly and accurately translated . However, learning foreign languages is not a waste of time. As human beings, we always use our body language to show what our thoughts actually are. I will explain in this essay why this is important for people. Ċ First of all, tongues have a soul. When people speak, they add their emotions and mood. It completely changes what the other person understands, For instance, Turkish has a lot of words that you will not have an idea of without any gestures. Translation has artificial intelligence and it lacks sentiment. Secondly, the tongue dates back before the common era. There is a big history behind them. Although it has changed over time, it already contains overtones of its own past. If we want to feel this, we need to hear tones when a person speaks. We can’t feel any atmosphere on the computer. Ċ On the other hand, some dialects need an emphasis so that people can understand the feeling in the speech. As an example of this situation, we can give an accent problem. When we learn different languages, we can’t break our accents. We imitate native speakers in order to speak fluently and understandably. Ċ In conclusion, humans use technological apps to translate because they don’t know languages. They take advantage of information ages. NeverthelessAdd a comma,NeverthelessIt appears that you are missing a comma after the introductory phrase Nevertheless. Consider adding a comma. Ċ show examples ıf people can learn languages, they will realize human sense. Besides, learning a new language means discovering other cultures and traditions like taking a trip to a new place."
9584,"Some people think that the government have the duty to ensure its citizen have a healthy diet, while others argue its the responsiblity of each individuals. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","A debated topic is that whether the government should be responsible for the healthy diets for its people. Although there are good reasons to support this, I believe each person have responsibility in the safety for their meals. Ċ In this modern age, people's food demand is developing. It results in a countless number of products for people choices. In this situation, the government plays an important role to guarantee food safety for its consumers. Under governmental control, harmful foods will be reduced and people can freely choose the nourishing ones without worrying much about their origin or quality. In addition, with stricter food laws, the government can put a curb on illegal food import as well as hold a check on consumed products in markets or restaurants. Also, some governments insist on raising awareness of people to safeguard them from unhealthy diet. Ċ Despite the importance of government in controlling food safety, each person should bear responsibility to build their suitable and healthy diets. With a large food market as present, individuals can easily decide what ingredients in their meals will be and how nourishing they are. In fact, foods are not unhealthy if people are aware of consuming them rightly. Moreover, many people are allergic with some typical foods even though they are healthy for others. It is unjustified for governments to restrict consumption of tuna because some people have allergy with it. Ċ From this point, I extremely agree that each individual have a duty to build a nourishing diet for themselves despite the undeniable advantages from government in protecting us from unhealthy food."
9585,Open carry and public safety Some people believe that a police force carring guns will encourage a higher level of violence in society.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"More and more countries start to allowed police officers carry guns at work.Some people think the regulation of policeman carrying guns will prompt social violence.I partly agree with this view. Ċ Before we think about the carrying guns regulation,we must know that the guns carried by the police help to deter violent crime.The policeman who carry guns are specially trained by Authorised Firearms Officers.They will not hurt normal citizens.Also,guns can help police officers to stop and catch violent criminals more efficiently.It can deter perceived threats from protential criminals.On the meanwhile,police officer canuse guns to protect themselves against violent criminals. Ċ On the other hand,if the police officers can not take a clear judgement of criminals,innocent people may be injured or even killed in police shooting.As a result,people's fear of crime and the rate of gun crime will increase.It is also detrimental to the building of harmonious and stable social environment.Imagine,when the crime starts on a street,not only do you need to be wary of harm from criminals,but you also need to aviod accidentally injure from the police,it seems too bad.Furthermore,criminals are more likely ro carry guns if they know that the police officers are armed with guns,which increase the invisible danger of crime.All in all,police officers should use their gun responsibily. Ċ For the proper of the police's right to bear arms,there is still a ong way to go.Not only the government should checks the comprehensive quality of the police.All the police officers need to reflect themselves and thinl more before pull their guns."
9586,More renewable energy sources are harnessed to generate electricity these days. What are disadvantages and advantages of this trend?,"Tend to use renewable energy to produce electricity. Even though free-pollution air would be created, its operational system requires more budgets. Ċ Renewable energy is great for our energy portfolio because they are inexhaustible and will not pollute the environment for us or those of future generations by emitting toxic chemicals and gases. For instance, solar energy creates absolutely no pollution, it means clean and results in little to no greenhouse and net carbon emissions. It will not deplete our natural resources and have minimal, if any, negative impacts on the environment, with no waste products of Co2 and other, more toxic take with different sources of energy. The use of this energy will not bring out bad effect such as air pollution so that communities are more likely to use it. Ċ On the other hand, the use renewable sources will spend much money because this needs many goods to encourage using this energy and have high maintenance expenses. For example, when we use a solar system that it should consider because the initial cost for purchasing a solar system is fairly high like the UK government has introduced some schemes for encouraging the adoption of renewable energy sources, such as the the Feed-in Tariff, you still have to cover the upfront costs. This includes paying for solar panels, inverter, batteries, wiring and for the installation. This condition shows that the use of renewable energy needs much money to purchase goods and require high maintenance expenses. Ċ To conclude, the use of renewable energy has less risk to environment and even this would Ċ Be free of the air-pollution but this will spend much money to purchase the goods of renewable energy and to maintain its equipment."
9587,"Nowadays, there is an increase in jobless rate in some countries. While some people believe that it can reduce a crime and improve nation's income, others argue that companies cannot pay the employer's payment due to a rise of staff member. I personally believe that it is not good idea.","The first positive of making unemployed take a job is how it can reduce a crime rate. Result shows that almost all criminals are unemployed people in several countries. One of the alternatives that government can take to diminish a crime is by giving them a job. Ċ In addition, workers can improve the nation's income because the more salaries citizens get, the more taxes commonwealths pay. For example, there are few number of unemployed in some rich nations while there are large number of jobless in some poor nations. It is thus clear that there is correlation between the number of unemployed and nation's income. Ċ However, the negative side of making them to take a job is the increasing of labor that make employers should spend much money to pay their salaries. This is because there are many employee just have school leaver level that is not required in companies . Result of Indonesian statistic shows 80 % of unemployed people is not graduate school. It means that they do not have qualification which is needed in several corporations. As a result, they just waste the companies' finance while the quality that they produce is inappropriate with their payment. Ċ The aforementioned evidence shows that although this can minimize the amount of crime, much money that employer must fund for worker paid. I personally believe that jobless have to have a bachelor's degree before register in a company."
9588,It is as important to teach children to protect the environment as it is to teach them to read and write. To what extent do you agree with this statement? Give reasons for your answers and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Although there is no doubt that it is essential to teach children how to save the environment, I think it does not have the same importance as teaching them how to read and write. this is because reading and writing skills are vital for their brain development and at that young age, they can not be responsible for environmental protection. in this essay, I will support my opinion with examples. Ċ Firstly, Langauge skills are the basic knowledge that the offspring should be taught especially at that early stage of their life. As those skills help them to learn about everything else like Science, Maths, Geography and other topics. for example, If the child learns reading and writing, he can not just only easily communicate with others but also express himself in a better way as he will be well-educated. Furthermore, recent research shows that the infant's brain has a wider capacity to learn new things than adults. Ċ Secondly, I suppose that teaching the children to protect the environment is impracticable because they can not behold responsible for such a thing. For instance, If infants accomplished acquiring those essential language techniques, they would be able to read articles about keeping the surrounding areas clean. Moreover, being capable to read and write benefits the offspring as well as has an insurmountable effect on society. Ċ To conclude, I completely disagree that learning about saving the surroundings is not as necessary as knowing about reading and writing at the beginning of the child's education stage. To illustrate it is too early and language lessons are way important, So these children will be highly educated when they grown-up."
9589,"Some disasters or calamities bring some opportunities in disguise. Some people think there is always a silver lining to a problem, while others think that disasters are always damaging. Ċ Do you agree or disagree? Put across your opinion with relevant supporting points or examples.","There is a belief amongst few that catastrophe's can sometimes have a positive impact while others are of the belief that it causes damage invariably.In my opinion, calamities have a severe negative impact not only on the human race, but also on the entire ecosystem consisting of plants and animals as well in some of the cases. Ċ Undoubtedly, disasters exacerbate health problems of the society.Moreover, events such as earthquakes, Tsunami can cause severe physical injuries and are considered fatal as well.Additionally, other disasters can have adverse impact not only on physical condition, but also the mental health of an individual.For instance, a current ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, which is an airborne disease, has affected lungs of the contracted people resulting in thousands of deaths around the world.Therefore, it has forced governments around the globe to order a complete lockdown impacting social lives of everyone, creating emotional turbulence.Furthermore, families of people dying are going through additional emotional trauma. Ċ Consequently, calamities have a prodigious downward effect on various business sectors of the society.Thus, various people lose their employment due to the slowdown in the markets.The paucity of resources due to unemployment renders a hurdle to fulfil their rudimentary needs as well.Moreover, slowness in markets significantly impacts the national economy as well.For example, in this current pandemic due to the closure of businesses, people have lost their jobs resulting in a global recession and sinking of economics around 5% including developed nations such as United Nations, France, Italy etc. Ċ To conclude, humans are the social animals and love to be surrounded by their friends and loved ones and disasters definitely deters them to lead their normal life.Moreover, calamities affect economies as well.So, according to me catastrophe is always harmful in one of the other ways."
9590,"In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","In many companies,employees tend to exchange words online rather than communicating directly.This notion is believed to have negative impactions due to the fact that some crucial talks may be leaked out easily despite some benefits. Ċ There are two main reasons explained why people prefer to use the online rather than meeting face to face method.One of those is the comfortable that the internet brings which allow people to transmitting their words to their opposite without formal setting.For instance,employers will have to dress formaly and a clean environment when having a direct contact with their boss,however,smart gadgets could delivering messages without concerning about the owners' current situation.As a result,a lot of time is saved and both could feel relaxing meanwhile interacting effectively with each other. Ċ On the other hand,there are many long sitting still being held not only in business but all other industries.This reality reflects the online world as an unreliable method owing to it vulnerable when comes to hacking,scamming and leaking users' information.Google,for instance,had been accused by many that this company tracking people and gathering their data to provide for those who need.Furthermore,by not talking face to face directly,the social bonding skill between humans will be fragile which people would find it difficult to express themselves without the support from the third party. Ċ In conclusion,although there are many benefits of having words through smart gadgets,there are still many potential consequences that are unforseenable.Thus,in order to protect the core information,people should consider other types of communicating rather than the internet."
9591,"Smart phones are being used in classrooms more than ever before. Some people think that this aids the learning process, while other think it hinders it. Ċ Discuss both these views and give your Own Opinion.","The use of smart electronic devices such as iPhone, iPad and Android in education has increased a lot than before. Some say this helps the learning, whereas others think it does not. Although smart phones in the classroom reduces interpersonal communication skill and increases typo mistakes, I believe it is essential to incorporate latest technology in the study room because of the modern interactive learning. Ċ On the one hand, using too much word processing software makes student spelling mistakes and it decreases the student-teacher communications. Modern days software has ultra intelligence to auto correct the mistakes and frequently using it will reduce the ability to write on a paper. In addition, participating in a debate in the class creates a natural bonding between classmates and instructors, while following a lecture on the iPad or Android gadgets does not create such environment. However, it is nice to have personal interactions, but the Internet makes learning easy and interesting. Ċ On the other hand, the web and smart gadgets make study creative and interactive. Graphical presentation makes any topic more understanding and pupils can view them multiple times in their own space. For example, most of the school and colleges in the United States have free Internet to browse institute's portals where they can upload their assignments and download lectures. Not only that, some universities have launched a distance education program where anyone can join in the class from anywhere in the world. I believe, technology has aided the lecture room with a variety of resources which were not available in the past traditional system. Ċ In conclusion, on the rise of modern technology the smart devices are being used more frequently in the lecture room than before. Despite some negative impacts one education system, it makes the classroom more interesting and students can join freely from any country."
9592,"The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?","Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees. Ċ Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education. Ċ Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well. Ċ Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future. Ċ In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them."
9593,"Screen dependency problem Topic: Nowadays, children spend too much time watching TV and playing computer games. Some people believe this has negative effects on children's mental abilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In modern society, it is much easier for children to get computer games and spend more time on TV than before. Besides, parents are busy finishing and handling their work. As a result, they do not have enough time to accompany their children. And parents will use TV and games to accompany their children. Thus, children waste a lot of time on this electronic entertainment. Is it a negative effect on children's mental abilities? To me, I agree with this point. I think watching TV and playing computer games are negative on children's mental abilities. Ċ First of all, watching TV and playing computer games cause children to reduce thinking. TV programs and computer games provide numerous images and sounds. Children do not have the opportunity to imagine and create their thinking. They lose the opportunity to think and grow up. It will affect children's mental abilities. By contrast, activities like reading or drawing develop many areas of the brain and help children to think and imagine. Ċ In the second place, children will decrease interaction with other people because of spending much time watching TV and playing computer games. When children spend a lot of time watching TV and playing computer games all day, they will not have time and the opportunity to play outdoors with other people. Physical activity also helps with brain development. Therefore, children should be discouraged from watching TV and playing computer games. Ċ To conclude, our bodies and minds need to move and think. If we stop them moving, our bodies and minds will get worse. Therefore, we should help children's mental abilities through reading and drawing instead of spending too much time watching TV and playing computer games."
9594,"Nowadays, more people prefer to shop in supermarkets rather than in small shops and local markets. Why do you think this is? Is it a positive or negative development?","It is true that people in growing numbers tend to buy things in supermarkets rather than small stores and local markets. There are a variety of reasons for this trend, and I believe it has both benefits and drawbacks. Ċ Supermarkets are gaining increasing popularity for various reasons. Perhaps the most important one is that they provide customers with a wider variety of products at lower prices. This is because supermarkets normally purchase items in bulk from suppliers, which means they are likely to enjoy discounts to a large extent. In other words, supermarkets can afford to lower the prices of their products to attract consumers. Besides, with strict regulations and effective management, supermarkets are able to keep their products fresher than those sold in small stores and local markets, which sometimes sell products that exceed shelf life. Also, supermarkets usually have large parking lots available to attract car owners, who normally have more buying power. Without these facilities, small stores and local markets pale in comparison with supermarkets. Ċ Apart from facilitating citizens by providing them with better products and services, supermarkets also bring some drawbacks with citizens' preference for supermarket shopping. First of all, with more people going to supermarkets, small stores and local markets would be driven out of businesses, which would lead to unemployment. Besides, small stores and markets are usually located near residential areas. If they disappeared, residents would have to drive long distances to find a supermarket, rather than going to a local convenience store within walking distance. This can significantly bring people inconvenience, which is particularly true for elderly people or those who cannot drive or ride. Ċ To sum up, there are a host of reasons for people's preference for shopping in supermarkets, and I firmly believe this trend has both positive and negative effects."
9595,‘Prisons are an expensive way of making bad people worse’ – To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Punishment is often imposed as a consequence of wrongdoings. Locking criminals behind bars is one of the common approaches, however, many people consider this practice as an expensive way of making things worse. I totally disagree with this statement and will provide further details to substantiate the same in the course of the essay. Ċ To begin with, confinement is one of the major reasons that stops several people to commit any crime due to their fear of spending years in confinement. This will have a negative impact on their life as it puts them away from their loved ones. When they experience prison time in an alone and miserable environment, they tend to strive towards better prospects after their release. For example, there are numerous convicts who learn the value of their independence and seek a stable life. Ċ Furthermore, it is known that the convicts are from a disturbing social background and lack basic ethical values, such as integrity, hard work, and individual responsibility. Having to spend time in jail might give them the opportunities to reflect upon themselves. In addition to this, they earn their food and basic needs by physical labour, resulting in a better understanding of responsibility, particularly in juveniles. Moreover, there are a few prisons that offer education in order to attain the skills required in the future. For instance, prisons in various developing countries have initiated education for juveniles in terms of skills, such as arts and crafts which might be beneficial to lead a normal life. Ċ To conclude, although it is believed that the capital dedicated to locking convicts behind bars is an unnecessary way and will result in deteriorating the situation by increasing criminal activity, it appears the individuals who commit crimes are offered this opportunity to value their freedom and learn skills encouraging them to live and provide social mobility. After a thorough analysis of the topic, I believe that prison time is an effective way to control criminal activity."
9596,"Some people say that punishment is the best way to teach children to behave well, while others disagree and point out that rewarding and praising them is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Few individuals contend that penalties are the most efficient way to discipline youngsters, whereas opponents argue that appreciations are more helpful. Both strategies have their pros and cons and I am not able to take a clear stance in favour or against any policy; both approaches must be adapted according to the circumstances. Ċ To begin with, the people who are in favour of punishment have many justifications to support their viewpoint. The different types of penalties including fines, corporal punishments, and physical tasks develop the deterrent among adolescents which refrains them from wrongdoing. Furthermore, punishments for mistakes left imprints in their innocent minds in order to differentiate between good and bad in their later lives. For instance, some disciplinary actions to implement the rules and regulations of schools discipline the lives of pupils, which are extremely useful for their future. Ċ On the contrary, others advocate that rewards and praises more beneficial. First and foremost, appreciations do not affect the self esteems of children, which avoid many psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression and psychosis. Moreover, it is proven in the research that not only the academic performance of students who are praised is far better but also they behave well than deter-driven kids. For example, the proportion of population-based notorious criminals in India is far more than in European countries where Indian schools have opted for punishments whereas, Europian uses rewards policy predominately. Ċ In conclusion, even though punishment is the most convenient way to maintain discipline, it can impact the mental healths and social behaviours of youngsters. I think that sensible use of both can make young ones the useful a part of society."
9597,"Traffic congestion is a major problem in most large cities ,nowadays. Ċ What are the causes of traffic congestion in cities? Ċ What could the government do to reduce this problem?","The increasing growth of big cities can produce several side-effects. An issue that has been recently in the spotlight is traffic congestion and all the problems that come with it. This essay will explore the main causes of this topic, as well as present a few opportunities to mitigate its negative impacts. Ċ To begin with, let us explore the main reasons behind the surge in traffic. Firstly, to have a big number of cars in the streets there must be a huge number of people living nearby, which is the definition of overcrowding. To exemplify, it is easy to see that in big cities like New York there is an ever-increasing number of skyscrapers built downtown which are certainly contributing to the problem. Secondly, not only there is a concentration of people but also of companies. Important law firms, hedge funds and other enterprises always rent offices next to each other. This, in turn, causes the population to commute to the same area every day at the same time periods. Ċ Despite what was presented above, there are ways to solve this conflict. To start with, the government could incentivize remote work. If people could work from home there would be no need for them to be physically present at offices, thus eliminating the daily commute. This phenomenon is happening around the world at big companies, especially after the covid-19 pandemic. In addition to that, another way of mitigating traffic congestion is by increasing investments in infrastructure. Many studies have shown that when governments start to expand subway lines, buy more buses and create bicycle lanes there is an astounding decrease in traffic jams. To illustrate this, the Netherlands promotion of bicycle usage has produced some amazing positive impacts. Ċ To conclude, with the global population increasing and moving to big cities, conflicts are certain to arise. The concentration of companies and overcrowding definitely contribute to the surge in traffic congestion, however, promoting remote work and investing in infrastructure are proven ways to reduce this harm. Governments around the globe should start to work on the solutions right now so that positive changes will be able to be seen in the upcoming future."
9598,"The government should ban smoking in all public places, even though this would restrict some other people's freedoms. Ċ Do you agree or disagree? Ċ Give reasons for your answer.","All around the world smoking in open areas exposed to the general public has been prohibited. It is done because it's harmful to children, pregnant women and old age people and can cause hazardous diseases. Even though, it takes away the liberty of people’s, such measures are required to be taken. In this essay, we will argue about government should ban smoking in all public places, even though this would restrict some other people's freedoms. Ċ Firstly, several times, it is seen that people are smoking in public places and it may cause discomfort to the people around the smoker and it is one of the most significant factors of putting a ban on smoking by governments of many states. However, it might look violation of freedom, but it is not important than public health. For example- A person got to die in Delhi, The capital of India, due to suffocation when one of his companions was smoking, since then, Indian Government levies the penalty of Rs 2000, if anyone, found to be guilty in such cases. Ċ Secondly, Smoking in open places like in the metro, movie theatres, bus stations or any other places captivate children to have a sip of tobacco, which, consequently, leads them to get addicted to it. Furthermore, it also causes many hazardous diseases like cancer, lung problem and so on. Moreover, it is one of the factors in addition to air pollution. For Instance- A research study conducted in India concluded that increasing smoking in public places enhances the pollution level. Ċ To conclude, in my view, forbidding smoking is an essential step, which must be taken to restrict negative impacts on the general public. Smoking and consumption of alcohol are bad habits and should not be allowed in public places."
9599,"In today’s very competitive world, a worker has to possess multiple skills to succeed. Among the skills that a worker should possess, which skill do you think is more important, social skills or good qualifications? Explain the reasons and provide specific examples to support your answer.","Nowadays, working people need to have a lot of skills beyond good qualifications other skills such as management skills, soft skills... I think qualification skills and social skills are indispensable in this current age. Because it determines whether you can do it or not. This essay will discuss both points of view before coming to a reasoned conclusion. Ċ First, we need to understand social skills is what we interact with or contact with others. And in the social skills of work is one of the most important factors, we should listen and respond kindly to the task to be smooth. Social skills, build the necessary personality traits such as trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness and this creates strong teamwork. For example: In the environmental work, if we could connect with most people, and when we face difficulties, There will always be colleagues who are ready to help. Ċ However, besides social skills, qualification skills are also really necessary. Professional skills are what we are taught and through practical performances that will determine our career path later. In addition, during work, we can learn and supplement other skills. Life is growing day by day, requiring people to have in0depth knowledge, so everyone needs to constantly train and learn to improve themselves and have a better promotion at work. For instance: we sometimes get stuff, we can ask people for help, but if we don't have a good accomplishment, then our career will be still in place or we will be eliminated sooner. Ċ In summary, whatever qualification or social skills are all important in the process of our professional activities. To complete the job well, we have to practice and promote these two factors to increase our values."
9600,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The most important goal of education is to teach people how to educate themselves.,"People usually hold different opinions while mentioning about goal of education. There is no doubt in my mind that education is an impeller of self-education. To my way of thinking, education goal would be considered in following two perspectives: first, limited resources; second, different academic areas. Ċ First of all, I am convinced that education resources are limited. Schools cannot teach everything for a long time and do not have many teachers to instruct every student. Graduate education can exemplify for the limited resources. Graduate students, already having partly higher education, always do the research for their own thesis project and need to look up some journal paper by their own. There are no many professors to teach everything all students want to learn, so the student should learn by themselves. They can surf the Internet to find the answer to the question and coordinate or discuss each other. Ċ Moreover, variety of education areas can also be an important reason for education goal. As far as I am concerned, there are so many field to learn, but there won't be an expert who specializes everyone' s interest right there. People need to learn by themselves as a result. Let's take my brother, Bill, a literature student, as an example. Bill always want to learn the knowledge about the field out of his own major, such as math and chemical. However, there are no science professor in his college at all. It pushes him to learn by himself. For example, he watches the open courses, organic chemistry and physical chemistry, on the website of MIT. Ċ In conclusion, we can make clear from the above discussion that resources and sundry research fields are both playing prime roles for education and we cannot throw anything behind. Above all, education, I think, is a best precursor of the learning."
9601,An increasing amount of students have negative attitude of learning. What do you think this is happening? What can be done about it?,"In the present-day society, many educational problems have arisen. One of the serious issues is that an increasing number of students have negative feeling toward study. In my opinion, there are some possible causes of this phenomenon and some solutions can be taken into account. Ċ To begin with, students today are given too much pressure from not only schools and parents, but also the society. Most of the students are told to confront with severe job-hunting competition since they are young. Under this cruel reality, the younger generations are given countless assignments and tests in order to get better academic performance. Gradually, students would study just for passing the exams and they lost interests in learning. Study is no longer fun but it is regarded as misery burdens. Ċ Secondly, in most of the countries, some unnecessary subjects in curriculum are compulsory for students to take up, which are unlikely to help the majority of them in future career. Therefore, a science student may have to spend time remembering all the history questions while an art student may have to struggle with math problems. In the long- term, learning compulsory units that they don't actually need for building future career actually lessen their passion and energy in study. Ċ However, I believe some measure can be done to relieve this situation. Firstly, parents and teachers should give less stress but more encouragements and motivations to the youngsters. Schools can set more scholarships as rewarded to courage more students to learn. Secondly, students should be told to aware that learning is happy. They should be told that it is the knowledge that helps us get rid of poverty to have a better live than those who live in poverty striken areas. Ċ In conclusion, several factors contribute to the negative attitude towards studying. In my opinion, the whole society should try to help students to overcome these issues as possible as we can."
9602,Online education is rapidly increasing in popularity. What has led to this development? What are the advantages and disadvantages of online learning compared to in-class instructions?,"Issues related to online education are frequently discussed these days. It is true that studying online has hugely grown over the recent years. The causes of learning online, as well as both major benefits and drawbacks of the online course, will be explored in the following paragraphs. Ċ As for the first question, thanks to the rapid development of technologies, such as computers and the internet, it offers humans to adapt their livings to be convenient than before. Thus, studying online is one of the benefits of upcoming technologies. On the one hand, there are several merits of online learning. The principal reason is that online courses offer education in a flexible way in terms of places and times. This means that students can learn from any sites of the world where the internet is accessed. Moreover, pupils have greatly reduced the education cost including transportations and accommodation due to study from their hometowns. For instance, nowadays, the young living in Thailand can study Master Degree with Professors in London Business School through online courses and have certificates later. Ċ On the other hand, there are a variety of demerits associated with online courses. The main reason is that people may not have a great opportunity for face-to-face activities. Generally, having experiences with peers in the university is the best opportunity in campus’s life. Besides, some people, especially children, often lack the concentration of the lesson when they have to learn on the computer all day. To exemplify, most parents in Thailand have to teach their offspring by themselves since their children cannot focus on the teacher talking through the tablet. Ċ All things considered; I am of the opinion that though online education in academics seems to be more convenient than before, students might lack some opportunities to share with their peers."
9603,"2.	Many claim that the fast-food industry had a negative effect on the environment, eating habits, and families. Ċ To what extend do you agree or disagree?","Countless people think that instant-meal producers create an adverse influence on many things, such as the environment, eating attitude, and the lifestyles of families. Now I will express my opinion on why I agree with this point of view. Ċ Firstly, being healthy is dependent on many factors, particularly, what you eat is one of the core factors for it, and eating junk cuisine is seriously harmful to our health. For instance, nowadays, obesity is becoming a more popular disease in modern society than in the past. The reason for it is that many fast-food producers incorporated in the last century and various types of addictive instant foods are invented by them. Furthermore, getting fast feed is not only easier than cooking a home meal but also we can buy it everywhere near our home and office. Ċ Secondly, I want to talk about the addictive side of instant drinks. For example, this kind of meal is always so delicious to your tasting sense, so children tend to get an addiction to eating junk food because of its taste. Then, a child's eating habits can influence family eating patterns adversely. Add more, families' eating routine may be transformed a lot into the mode to always eat this kind of food because easy and delicious sides of the fast meals are always advertised on social media and television, this food is displayed that the food acts as environmentally and health-friendly on some advertisement. Ċ In conclusion, considering that increasing obesity and creating the addiction of negative effect on families' eating habits, we should refrain this type of bread, even it is tasty and easy to buy, in order to protect our digestive system and save our children's health."
9604,"Nowadays, a lot of buildings, such as offices and schools, are now being built with an open plan design. why is that?  do you see this as positive or negative development? open plan design is the future","In this modern era, there are some architectures, which are used for people to work or children to study, are using an open plan design because of two main reasons, they are development of technology and environmental reason. and I strongly believe that it gives positive impact for our society. Ċ Open plan design will be able to people communicate and do interaction everyday. It will lead decreasing antisocial habit in our society. Because of development of technology, people are using their gadget to do daily activities more often such as gaming, listening music, ordering food, and buying something through social media, this condition produce individualistic people who do not want to talk each other even though they meet everyday. For example, people would rather spend lunchtime-break on their phone and eat their meals in the cubical room than gather and talk with friends in the canteen. Ċ Beside that, open plan design gives good impact for environment. If a building used it, air circulation would flow well, which means using air conditioner is not necessary anymore. since it has been considered as one of cause of ozone layer damage, usage of AC highly unrecommended. in the future, if open plan design is applied for all building in the world, negative effect of global warming can be reduced. Ċ to sum up, open plan design will lead positive development because people would be interact with each other more often, and it makes usage of air conditioner is not necessary anymore, which means it can be reducing of risk of global warming."
9605,"Some people feel that it is always wrong to keep animals in captivity, for instance in zoos. Other people say that there are benefits for the animals and for humans. Discuss both sides of this debate, and give your personal view","There is a debate whether animals should not be kept in zoos while other parties believe that it is favourable for both of the species to keep there. This essay will illustrate both of the viewpoints and then I will give my personal opinion on the matter. Ċ On one hand, when it comes to the library it is crucial to mention the topic of rights. In addition, Living in the 21st century where rights have taken different forms such as human and animal rights. Activism, for example, is one of the activities that people do when they stand out for a cause. In this case, we have been seeing many activists who support the notion that animals should not be captivated. Hence, we have to consider animals rights since they do not have anyone to represent them. This is to say, species have the tendency to follow their own nature, so for ,animals nature is to be out there. Ċ On other hand, humans had evolved from the agricultural revolution to the industrial's revolution. We have seen many forms of globalization that humans started to construct buildings, roads, and schools. In fact, one of the barriers to this kind of advancement was animals. Animals were everywhere which created major problems like people getting attacked by animals, someone getting beaten, and so on. Therefore, human beings decided to lock these animals in place to avoid future atrocities. Then, a businessman decided to generate profit from these shelters and here it was the born of the first zoo in the world. Nowadays, zoos are one of the assets that attract people from different parts of the world. Ċ In conclusion, it seems that every side has an argumentative viewpoint that one would lead to security and the other to more sense of humanity. On balance, however, I strongly agree with the consensus that believes that animals should be in the zoo. This is because every era has its own way of living and in this ,era animals should be captivated."
9606,Some people think that teenagers should follow the old generation but others believe that they sould challenge the old thoughts. Discuss both view and give your opinion.,"It is a controversial issue as to whether adolescents ought to follow the convention of their ancestors, or, whether they had better raise questions on orthodox and other beliefs of older people. From my perspective, young generation excepts those thoughts of predecessors, which is essential in everyday life and rejects those sorts of beliefs that hamper them. Ċ To begin with, from many generations, people nourish some facts and ideas, which are, invariably, helping till now, even though juveniles do not follow. However, if they abide by these rules, they would get a success in life. For example, in India, most of the parents have a good knowledge of education, which they learnt it from teachers at their school such as early rising, memorizing critical topic in the morning, maintaining a balance-diet, eating meals on time. These days, students are unbridled in following any of these regulations that Japanese maintain from the time immemorial. As a result, they lag behind not only in good health but also studying properly. Ċ In contrast, there are some disadvantages to obey the tradition, and it should not be done by young people. In Hinduism, for instance, before 100 years ago, people used to sacrifice children before idols of goddesses. Thinking that goddesses might be happy, who could bestow wealth, fame and other happiness of life. Now, the present generation should raise their voice against this inhuman attitude, though it is prevailing some parts of the area in India. Another important factor is childhood marriages, which are ubiquitous from western countries to Asian countries. For that reason, teenagers should take a legal action about this. Thus, some conventions must restrict by the hand of youngsters. Ċ In conclusion, although myriads of masses think that children should follow the tradition of older people, some believe that they should fight against old thoughts. In my opinion, the idea, which is positive, has to accept by teenagers, and the negative ideas must be challenged through them."
9607,Television Sporting shows such as the Olympics motivate the youth who do not like to exercise much. Do you agree or disagree? Include relevant examples in your answer and provide your own opinion.,"Nowadays, sports shows attract many viewers. It is believed that games telecasts on TV brings enthusiasm towards exercise among young people who do not like doing physical activity.I disagree with this notion. Individual interests and the message driven by sports are the cardinal reasons which will be analysed in the before an opinion is drawn in subsequent paragraphs. Ċ Firstly, there are multifarious sports channels are available worldwide such as Star sports, Ten sports and ESPN. This is not always the case, these channels target people who dislike physical jerks. In other words, these sports programmes are more likely to entice individuals those already have an interest in doing exertion or playing outdoor games. For example, study by sports authority of India, showed that 95% of the crowd watching a cricket match during IPL are the ones have a strong desire in playing cricket. Therefore, sports event failed to bring any interest in sports. Ċ Secondly, the athletic events fail to encourage the young generation on exercising because these events fail to convey the importance of workout. Generally, people who usually dislike exercising, are the ones who have a lack of awareness in doing workout in their health. Moreover, instead of motivating adolescents towards exercising, sports programme sometimes enables youngsters to adopt sedentary life. For instance, during the world cup match, most of the people being couch-potato, stick to one place, and keep watching match whole day continuously. Hence, sports do not drive any message to lethargic youth in order to foster to perform physical movement. Ċ To conclude, in my opinion, sports programmes may imbue laziness in teenagers rather than persuade them to exercise. In addition, an inactive group of people may overlook the sports tournaments owing to lack of interest in it."
9608,Most people prefer shopping in supermarkets nowadays. How does this affect the local shops? What are the positive and negative impacts of this development?,"In the current scenario, the majority of the public prefers to purchase products from mega-stores rather than local markets. This transformation has positive impacts in the form of the convenience of purchasing and attractive discounts on the product. Whereas, this evolution is accountable for the closing of minor outlets and unemployment among concerned staff. Ċ There are two major benefits of movement of consumers from small shops to mega shopping centre's. Firstly, masses can secure all desired items under one roof. In other words, the populace can purchase footwear, cloth, groceries, and electronic products from a single major outlet. As a result, they may save a huge time and invest in some fruitful activities. Secondly, nowadays, the shopping complex's are facilitating massive discounts on their commodities. As an outcome, people often rush towards these centres and avoid shopping from minor shops. For example, the latest survey by ""The Times of India"" reveals that 40% of the public in India claims that they prefer to visit the major shopping hub instead of small outlets for daily procurement. Ċ Despite these advantages, there are some disadvantages which could not be ignored. The first main negative is shutting down of small shops. This is happening because of people interest towards mega shopping hub. For instance, the latest report by ""The Global Times"" in China 50% of small shops have been closed due to consumers movement towards the mega shopping point. Similarly, this transformation is also responsible for job loss for employees of minor outlets. As a consequence, these staff members often commit crimes for sake of money. Ċ In conclusion, it has been observed that the massive shopping centre's are gaining more popularity than minor shops. This evolution has positive impacts in the form of ease of purchasing and attractive discounts on the product. On the other hand, this evolution is accountable for the closing of minor outlets and job loss among the general public."
9609,"Teachers are not as importance as they used to be because of the choice of other alternatives for students such as, online teaching.To what extent do you agree or disagree ?","In our modern society, the trend of studying online is the traditional way and it has been developed significantly in the last decade. It is argued by many that teachers are losing their prominence in the educational system. I completely agree with the statement. In this essay, I will further inspect the given topic and outline relevant examples to back my view. Ċ To commence with, although online learning courses have a host of benefits for students because of all educational websites are always accessible and convenient. Furthermore, people opt to study of the virtual teaching due to information as mentioned earlier so it is very comfortable and efficient for them. For example, at the present time the people of the world are kept quarantine caused by Curved 19 virus. I mean that all people have to use the online courses resulting in realizing the convince of using technology using to study or work. In other words, students are used to learning in online, but some of them do not prefer it. My point of view is that online studying is beneficial and cheaper for us. Ċ On the other hand, it is not secret that the process of distance learning students may face some difficulties and in such cases they may address to teachers for assistances. In my opinion, conventional teaching has stunning feelings, but educators are always using proven methods that have been practiced for more. For instance, some of the teachers are apathetic to teach for the students because their aims only salary doesn't educate them better. I think they should be cautious and the can also be a friend with them so it will motivate them for studying purposes. Ċ From what we have discussed above, we can clearly draw a conclusion that conventional methods are proven to be working and teachers should have a relationship with the students."
9610,"People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen. Ċ What is your opinion about an ideal society Ċ How can we create an ideal society?","The living environment is most important to live in different societies. Most countries are diverse because of different religions people are staying together in the same place, therefore, some people always try to make a nice environment in the colony but sometimes, because of the consequences, they are unable to make it. I will discuss some reasons for this happening and how to remove these problems in the following paragraphs. Ċ Staying with different masses who belong to another culture, can create some issues. This could be related to families, children and cleaning issues as well. First and foremost, usually, different languages, cultures and caste individuals hate each other and they do not like to talk or participate in their traditions. Moreover, teenager's behaviour is disappointed to the elders in the society that create problems with families. Furthermore, some other reasons like garbage, water, parking and so on, these reasons are always lost the bond between human beings. Ċ As it is said that, every problem has a solution. So these obstacles can also solve with co-operation with humanity. Firstly, the person living in the same society must talk and celebrate their festivals together and tell history about their traditions that will definitely make a strong bond in the community. Secondly, juvenile's acting is crucial to make a good environment in the community so parents ought to be careful about this and always teach them about human values. In addition, people should select a leader for their colony so that he will suggest every time to another regarding their responsibilities such as all the time clean ground area, proper use of bins and park area. Ċ In conclusion, it is commonly understood that anywhere we are living, it has some difficulties but those complications can be resolved with understanding and cooperating behaviour."
9611,"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skill such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?","Some people hold a belief that schools should be a place where students study academic subjects to pass examinations rather than learn skills such as dressing and cookery. In my opinion, despite the significance of the academic study , the scholar should also be taught the fundamental life technique. Ċ On the one hand, studying academic theory is vital for students in many ways. Firstly, examination results are essential for the scholar’ academic record. With good results, they will have easy admission in the high faculty.Secondly, academic course better equips one's with fundamental education that will be used in tertiary college. For example, the majority of scholars in India is supposed to pass subjects, such as Microeconomics and Advanced Mathematics, which are comprised of mathematical proficiency taught at university. Hence, without a deep understanding, they may fail the final exams and have to repeat these course again, which is time-consuming and costly. Ċ However, there are several reasons why scholar still needs to learn the practical technique. For instance, when living far from family, life experience such as cooking will be helpful to prepare healthy and affordable meals on their own instead of eating out at restaurants. Furthermore, attending skill-building classes at the institute is also an effective way for them to unwind after many hours of academic studying.Thus, through a wide range of activities not only graduate are able to relax and but also perform better in exams. Ċ In conclusion, I disagree that students should only consider academic study because both academic learning and practical skills are equally important and should be taught at school."
9612,"Alternative energy sources that use the natural power of the wind, waves and sun are too expensive and complicated to replace the coal, oil and gas that we use to power our cities and transport. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","Sustainable power plants begin to be concerned in developed countries. For this reason, those renewable energy farms unaffordable and complex to alter the conventional plantation such as coal, oil, and gas to meet Nationwide's electricity needs. While this is true for some extent since it takes many expenses and poor human resources, I firmly believe that these power plants have valuable merits because almost zero emissions and more long-term usage. Ċ It is evident that setting up power stations by using fossil fuel such as wind, waves, and sun needs an enormous budget since the tools solely assembled in the advanced country. States which have intention owing those sources, they might be considering about shipment cost, likewise its maintenance as well because the material just designed in the certain country. Furthermore, in major countries, it is undoubted that the number of experts regarding this field still limited. Ċ On the other hand, powering the cities by utilizing renewable energy is a wise way reducing pollution to the atmosphere. Moreover, as we can see that earth condition these day time by time merely experiencing the effect of global warming. Another reason, renewable energy is an energy which cannot run out forever, so people can utilize it in a long span. Taking an example, a country which is less of fossil fuels, like Netherlands tend to focus on wind turbine production. As a result, they are accustomed to this condition and more innovative with their own possession. Ċ To conclude, I utterly believe that using renewable energy to generate electricity in a tremendous function is the proper path to preserve our earth from climate change. Even though the price is more expensive, but I convinced that there will a mass production in the future, so it can be affordable for all states."
9613,"In the past,teachers were the main source of information,but today students have a wide source of information， so teachers are no longer important in the modern education. Do you agree or disagree?","Some people hold the opinion that teachers are no more essential in modern education for students can obtain information through much wider sources. From my perspective, I disagree with this point of view, and I believe teachers still play an important role in the educational progress of students. Ċ There are a number of reasons why I assert the importance of teachers. Predominantly, at school, only teachers can guide students face to face in real-time, providing a more systematic and efficient education. Teachers know how to teach students in terms of their weaknesses, and thus students can gain a more comprehensive knowledge system. Besides, the professionalism of certified teachers is more reliable. For instance, these teachers are much more familiar and experienced with the problems students usually face. As a result, students could get correct and standard answers from their teachers, less time and energy-consuming than searching on the internet. Ċ Undeniably, information on the internet takes certain advantages over that from teachers. For example, it covers a wider range of knowledge of teachers, and students can freely choose what they want to learn. However, information on the internet is a mixed bag. Not only professionals in specific areas but also the general public can publish comments and articles on knowledge websites and platforms, and therefore, students could be misled by the fallacious information, forming a wrong understanding, thereby, which might cause adverse effects to students in the long run. Ċ In conclusion, while I realize that wider access to information could benefit students, I do believe that the role and status of teachers can not be replaced in modern education."
9614,Many companies use advertisement to increase sales. What are the main reasons that make an advertisement effective? Is it a good thing or bad thing to the society?,"Several companies rely most of their business on the advertisement to increase sales. There are a number of reasons to make propaganda effective. However, it is not always made for the common good. Society has felt many times the positive and the negative effect of advertising. Ċ Firstly, the success of propaganda depends on the type of customer it is trying to reach. The traditional advertisement is the one broadcasted on tv, on the radio or billboards. They must be impactful with a fast narrative to catch customer attention and make them believe that the product is most needed. Moreover, digital marketing has brought a new perspective to sales. For instance,companies are now able to deliver a custom video or picture of a commodity to a potential buyer as a result of big data provided by the internet and social media. Ċ Even though the aggressive business of selling might bring economic benefit for establishments, it can be the reason for unnecessary consumerism. Additionally, society suffers from what is called “the scarcity thinking”. It is basically the fear of unfulfilled needs. For example, if there is a product being sold only within 3 days, people's minds are driven to buy it because it will end. Furthermore, companies are aware of it and they aggressively use marketing techniques to damage society in an unconscious way. Ċ To sum up, propagandas are not always harmful to people especially when it is done in honest ways. Unfortunately, the free market causes this aggressiveness in the way companies to produce their advertisement. If it is too soft, there will not be any sales and that is what makes the income grows. Hence, customers are the ones paying for a product, therefore they must put on the scale if they really need to buy it."
9615,"In some places, old age is valued, while in other cultures youth is considered more important. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It would seem that in some areas the old generation is valued ,however, in other cultures the young generations are cherished. From my point of view ,youths are the most significant assets in all countries all around the world. Ċ Firstly ,in my opinion ,the young generations are the most cherished in areas. For example ,we all know most companies prefer to employ individuals who are in their 20s as workforces because of having many advantages such as working about 30 hours per week and presenting useful ideas related to problem_solving and a better place to work. Additionally ,achieving the perfect balance can be seen among young people. This is a persuasive reason why these humans are the most necessary things in the world. Therefore ,this makes it clear there are multiple reasons to accept this view that should not be ignored. Ċ By contrast ,others believe the old generation is valuable. For instance ,in most countries all around the world where a powerful culture can be seen ,the people who are 65 years old habitually are managing these cherished legacies. Moreover ,these humans regularly believe exerting different experiences that old humans used to attain are the most crucial item to avoid making mistakes by other human beings who are living in the community. Needless to say ,retaining this generation can help to discover numerous ideas that are essential all around the globe. As a result ,it becomes apparent there are many reasons behind each claim via societies. Ċ To summarise ,I personally believe that young individuals are more important than the elderly generations. It is predicted that to continue using people who are young ,to administer all things ,human beings will have the best place to live in ,in the near future."
9616,Environmental problems such as pollution and climatic variations are increasing nowadays.The governments have taken some measures at a global level.But they got only few solution.Why is it so? How can this problem be solved?,"Rising ecological problems and change in the climate are some of the issues which are causing a serious threat to the whole society in the modern world.Although the regimes have taken steps at the world level, these measures are not enough to control the severe effects of this phenomenon.This is probably due to the lack of support and methods to overcome at the ground level.However, it can be solved by the active participation of the local governments and every citizen of the country. Ċ To commence with, the major cause of the rise in environmental pollution and climatic variations is less co-operation from the individual nation.Despite being a global issue, the role and effective initiatives to restrict the further spread of the polluting substances by each country cannot be denied.Since the need of the hour is to take preventive measures on an individual level only then such dangerous threats to the life of human beings can be avoided.In India, for instance, the Ganga action plan is one of the policy of the authorities to clean the river Ganga from pollutants.To elucidate, it would not be wise to rely totally on the international organisations, such as the UN, for the alleviation of these havocs. Ċ However, the solutions are simple.The local administrations and the citizens should take responsibility, and moreover, they cannot take a back seat and regard it as someone's else duty.It is the onus on the regime to make policies so as to safeguard the life of a variety of species on this planet and it must be done appropriately.For example, the ban of plastic bags in some of the developed and developing nations as these are non-biodegradable and pollutes the environment.To recapitulate, everyone must also accompany the governments in this direction. Ċ In conclusion, undeniably, ecological changes are continuously increasing at a fast pace these days.While authorities are working together, each one of us should play our part to save this beautiful planet."
9617,"agree or disagree question type. Some people think using computer, including laptops and mobile phones, during lessons is a good way to encourage children to learn. Do you agree or disagree with this view?","It is certainly the case that gadgets like laptops, computer and mobile phones is a good way to encourage children to learn. As it is difficult for children to stay focus on what teacher said during lesson with boring teaching like copying what teacher said. Also, tradition teaching techniques cannot present 3D concept. Ċ First, tradition teaching at school include copying what teacher wrote on blackboard and reading passage out during lessons. These methods lack of interaction which student sometime went dreaming. With the help of gadgets, learning apps made learning easier. There are apps that share teacher's powerpoint with students which students can focus on listening what teacher said instead of copying. Furthermore, online dictionary can help students understand lecture more. No need to interup teacher for asking what does this word means. These increase teacher teaching peace and help students understand lessons more, definitely encourage children to learn. Ċ Second, Math and science subject involve in a lot of 3D idea. Measurement and landscape in math and geography is hard for student to understand with textbook. Computers and laptops can present these in 3D, which student can switch the projection in different angle for better observation. These can give children a better idea of what that is instead of just imagination only. This can increase student interest toward learning for sure. Ċ In conclusion, convenience and better presentation are undoubtedly benefit brought by using gadgets during class and facilitate children learning. There are thoughts about social media will distract children through gadget and student are not going to focus is lessons is outdate. As technology is becoming advance, teacher can easily monitor students screen work on their computer. Laptop and computers can even block those distracting site before starting the class. These made me very super supportive toward this view."
9618,Cricket has become more popular than national sports in the subcontinent countries. Ċ what do you think are the reasons behind this?,"Nowadays, an extraordinary number of audience has given immense fame to the cricket. In the subcontinent, this is preferred more than the national sports. Since, there is rarely any country that does not include it. In my opinion, the procedure of the field and earning the money makes it popular. Ċ Undoubtedly, the prevailing reason that this sport has gained popularity is the evolution in the subcontinent before its revolution. Firstly, It was the only physical activity to introduce at national level throughout the region, by what the movement of players across 360 degrees attracted the immense crowd along with the handling of a bat or ball and the entertainment created during field time. For instance, considering a player, who hits a shot or maybe six, flying of a ball across the stadium or stopped by a fielder towards a wicket in a limited time gains attention. Consequently, the way to play an innings got concentration of the audience throughout the region. Ċ Furthermore, the preference towards the cricket over the national game is given owing to the activities and the huge income. This is because it receives tremendous financial assistance from sponsors and pays a handsome amount of money to players on both the annual basis and per match along with extra activities that include dancing on each hit by a batsman, fireworks for winning a game; however, the other sports like the FIFA, the Tennis, and the Hockey, which do not have those. For example, considering a player Shahid Afridi, if he hit six, the dancing team will start dancing, and if a game is won, the boundaries would be filled with fireworks. Hence, the cricket has specific activities, which entice the fellowship. Ċ In Conclusion, the historical events and the crowd have turned it as immensely famous. While including of entertaining exertion has given it more importance than national sports."
9619,"Levels of youth crime are increasing rapidly in most cities around the world. Ċ What are the reasons for this, and suggest some solutions.","It is argued that the quick increment of juvenile violation can be seen in towns all over the map. The child carelessness, social media and financial situation can be anticipated and, some appropriate measures can be taken by the government, parents and, teachers to tackle the issues that will be discussed in the subsequent paragraphs. Ċ To begin with the reasons for illegal acts, Firstly, the root issue of youth crime is child neglect. Due to hectic schedules, parents are not being able to spend quality time with their offspring. Thus, they do not have time to educate their children about moral values. Secondly, social media puts negative impacts on kids such as action and physical harassment movies. As celebrities are the role models of adolescences, their clips of movies are followed by kids in real life. For example, they make more enemies instead of friends in school or colleges and do fights on a regular basis which comes up with the result of injuries and murders. Hence, nowadays, it is hard to differentiate the social and normal life. Finally, youngsters do not have enough access to money. Due to the modern lifestyle, teenagers show their interest to follow new trends such as outings with friends. Consequently, they do robberies and blackmail others to get some money to fulfil their wishes. Ċ There are several actions that can be taken to overcome the issues described above. First of all, the simple solution would be to educate teens. Parents should be recommended to spend some time with their kids to aware them of socialising and the real world. Moreover, some events should be organized by the schools or colleges to teach students about different wrongdoing and the negative results in their future. Lastly, the government should make some strict laws for breaches such as imprisonment instead of penalities. This will help to create a fear in young minds to avoid these cases of lawlessness. Ċ To conclude, although carelessness, social network and financials are the reasons for the increasing crime rate, awareness and some strict laws will be helpful to reduce the number of cases."
9620,"Many people believe that family has the strongest influence on a child’s development, while others believe that external factors such as television, friends and music play a big role. Discuss both views ?","The behaviour of a child is an unpredictable one as it is influenced by a wide variety of aspects. Studies conducted by psychologists have shown that external factors play a greater role compared to their internal counterpart. Nonetheless, whether or not if this is true is the question the essay will answer. Ċ On one hand, external factors such as television are said to have a heavy influence on children. A survey conducted by Oxford University in 2019 has claimed that children were inspired by their favourite tv-show characters. In addition, the following is the reason why content is age-rated. Inappropriate content can leave a poor impression on the minor's judgement. In short, external circumstances play a major role in the development of a child. Ċ On the other hand, internal components like one's family are said to be a heavy influence on a child. For instance, if the parents of a household keep arguing the kid will always be stressed and it may affect his development. Furthermore, the youth's experience will prevent him or her from having a proper social life. In summary, internal factors can leave a lasting impression on the development of young ones. Ċ In a nutshell,external elements especially television play a vital role in the formative years of a kid. However, internal elements also tend to greatly influence pre-adolescents as they will spend most of their time at home rather than with external elements like friends. So it is absolutely vital to provide an environment for the kid that is safe and will nurture him or her."
9621,Film stars and celebrities often share their views on public matters that have little to do with their profession. Ċ Is this a positive or negative development?,"Issues related to public communication are frequently discussed these days. It is argued that superstar and movies stars have shared their perspectives on public issues which they lack sufficient information over recent years. Despite the fact that there are some drawbacks, I would argue that there are more benefits. The explanation of the merit will be shown in the following paragraphs. Ċ On the one hand, there are several benefits associated with the views of non-professional celebrities. The principal consequence is that famous people's views might have a positive impact on social movements more than an ordinary person. To explain, thanks to a huge number of their followers, several crucial topics shared on online platforms; such as environmental problems and critical laws, have been accessed by both local people and relevant organisations. For instance, although Lookgolf, a famous teacher and actor in Thailand, is not an environmental expert, he often posts his campaign about avoiding fast fashion brands. As a result, these significant issues are interested in the younger generation more than in the prior era. Ċ On the other hand, some opponents criticize that there are numerous drawbacks relevant to the views of movie stars. The main reason is that some ineffective data derive from celebrities' aspects; especially in medical information, can lead people to misunderstand and neglect professional recommendations. To exemplify, Thai superstars revealed that they opt to acquire Sinovac vaccine rather than others, thus, mRNA vaccines have been against in some rural areas since they believe their favourite actors. In this regard, it is evident that humans can be influenced by celebrities’ views which might have a negative result in many sectors. Ċ All things considered; I am of the opinion that the merits of sharing celebrities' views slightly outweigh the demerits because of the great discussion on essential problems in society. However, both individuals and movie stars should have an awareness of social responsibilities as well as carefully realize the effect on public platforms."
9622,Many high school students are opting for vocational courses rather than acedemic programs after high school. Do youthink this is a negative or positive development.,"That an increasing number of students would prefer pursuing vocational education to choosing academic studies at university has become a hotly debated subject among educators and grad students. Personally, I take the view that the trend’s merits outweigh its drawbacks. Ċ To begin with, it is indisputable that in comparison with vocational education which has a restricted area of expertise, an academic one has a broader scope of learning. Admittedly, an academic course may offer various related subjects/programs for undergraduates to explore. A student majoring in Mathematics, for instance, can also take classes on philosophy or other similar liberal arts studies. Consequently, this sort of learning can be helpful when helping pupils to create a well-rounded course of study and, more importantly, choose a rewarding and suitable career. Ċ Nonetheless, there are many more perks of learning in a vocational environment. Compared with theoretical courses, one of the most significant advantages of this development comes down to its hands-on experience. Vocational training offers students a specific trade that focuses solely on practicingChange the spellingpractisingThe spelling of practicing is a non-British variant. For consistency, consider replacing it with the British English spelling. Ċ show examples employment-ready skills needed for particular occupations at the workplace. For example, those wanting to become an engineer can apply for Airport Operations programs whose instructors are often industry professionals. Besides, pupils studying vocational courses can join the workforce quickly. Most program durations might be completed in two years or less, which are shorter than degree courses. As a result, students will be able to embark on a career soon, make money on their own, and live independently. Ċ In conclusion, both vocational courses and university education have their advantages and disadvantages. Students graduating from high school must see which course will fit their abilities in the long run. I think that opting for a vocational course rather than academic education will result in further promising career prospects."
9623,People doing dangerous sport activities like scuba diving and bungee jumping should be responsible for their own life and rescue workers should not risk their lives to save people doing those sports. Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, extreme games are increasing in popularity among sports enthusiasts mainly because of the high adrenaline that it provides. While some people believe that safety is solely in the hand of the participants and not rescue officials, I tend to partially agree with it as I believe it should involve both parties. Ċ Humans get bored very fast from the same routine activity and they are always on the look for challenging adventures. For instance, how will someone feel jumping out of an aeroplane rather than playing football, which they might have been doing often? The need for excitement pushes them to go and do challenging activities such as bungee jumping, skydiving and scuba diving. Engaging in extreme athletics is not wrong, but everyone should be aware of the consequences tied in together with it. They will need to ensure that proper processes and training are always followed. For example, to be able to dive in the deep sea, a person should have been trained by certified scuba diving trainers, so that they have the overall knowledge, and act accordingly whenever there is a risk. Ċ Furthermore, involving in adventurous pastimes shouldn’t be done without any proper guidance. In addition, we should only be affiliated with certified agencies by the safety authorities. This is mainly because the respective companies would have gone through various procedures to ensure the security of their customers. However, relief officers are not to be exempted here as certain circumstances will still need their expertise to be involved. These specially trained officers normally will be equipped with sophisticated tools and skills needed in special circumstances to save a life. For example, if someone has lost his way in the jungle while hiking, safety personnel in the area will be able to locate them easily as they would probably have the right expertise to apply and act fast on the mission. Ċ In summary, the above-mentioned reasons show that those who are involved in risky sports needs to be proactive whenever they engage in such actions and inform the relevant authorities whenever they take part in it, which I believe will be much safer for them."
9624,Modern technology has an influence on schools today. Do you think teachers will still have a role in 2050 or the study process will be completely computerised?,"Nowadays, rapidly developing technology has bringing tremendous changes on today's world. Technology affects our daily lives in everything that we do; it saves time, makes communication more easily and also affects on way to learning. Ċ Thanks to modern technological development, it might be becoming easy to pursue an education by attending to school or university online. It is common today that people attend courses or trainings by online. It helpful by saving time and shortening distance; people can learn in universities by online even they are in different continent. Children also could attend to online courses for their additional learning or homework. Also with advanced development of technology, children might learn subjects by internet using wide source of online materials. Therefore, technological development gives us wider possibility on learning than was before. Ċ However, teacher's role in education is could not be omitted specially for children. Teachers have an important role not only on pursuing knowledge, but also on becoming an individual. By attending in class and interacting with teacher and other students, children learn important communication skills such as how to interact with others, how to work together on tasks and how to express their opinion. The communication skill with others is the vital part of human's life in society to be an independent individual. Ċ Also, modern technology cannot replace the human totally. Computers might not have an ability to express emotions like a teacher and students. The one of important character of human's life is the way to expressing its emotion and makes others to understand his state. Ċ In my view, however technological development brings us wide range of possibility and advance in human beings daily life, it could not replace the human totally. Therefore, in 2050, teacher's role will still have an important role on children's education and their future social standing."
9625,It is better to raise children in the city than in the suburb?? Do you agree or disagree?,"No wonder, Childhood is the most important stage of human's life especially when this stage has a strong impact which lasts forever. Thus, I personally prefer to raise my children in the city than in the country suburbs. Ċ First of all, I will raise my children in the city, for all my family lives in the city. My children will rise up with the warm atmosphere of their relatives. They will grow up with the all my family, and they will learn how family is important to everyone as well as they will learn how to respect and to listen to the oldest people in the family. Moreover, they will deal with the grandparents and listen to their stories which are difficult to be erased from the memory of the children and that will help them to broaden their imagination and give them a fascinating picture about the world outside their narrow world. Ċ Besides, the atmosphere in the city is suitable for my children to build up their personalities properly to face this tough world. For instance, during my children lives in the city, they will be able to meet many people with diverse characters and experiences that will be addition to their experiences in this life. Accordingly, they will be able to handle their problems and deal with them bravely. Ċ To wind it up, life in the city will be more appropriate to me to raise my children. In fact, we have to be careful about the childhood stage of our children since it will be the reflection of their future and whether they will be successful or miserable in their overall lives."
9626,Employers should focus on personal qualities over qualifications and experience when choosing someone for job. Yo what extent do you agree with this?,"Educational qualification has become a great tool for securing a good job, hence, the recent increase in the number of people gaining admission into universities. However, some people say that employers should concentrate on personal attributes rather than academic degrees and experience while employing workers. I totally disagree with this viewpoint. Ċ One good reason why the status of education should be considered first during employment is the need for good communication. In other words, good communication skills are vital in all jobs, and to achieve this, one needs to be fluent in a language that is generally understood globally. Evidence of certificates is a proof to most companies that a person has passed through the university, and thus could communicate fluently. Any company that aspires to grow needs educated individuals in order to meet up with the international demand. Also, if only personal qualities are considered, it would be difficult to select individuals who are capable as everyone would claim to exhibit the required properties. Ċ Another point to consider is that some fields cannot cope with humans who do not posses the needed status of education and exposure. Such areas as Medicine and Nursing would need professionals who passed through the training in school because they involve human lives, and therefore, require special coaching. Furthermore, all management positions require greatly exposed and highly experienced personnel. For example, it has been noted that 60 percent of companies that closed up in Nigeria in the year 2017 was due to their management by inexperienced workers. Ċ In conclusion, it can be seen that an ability to communicate well and difficulty coping in medical fields are good reasons why educational levels and experience should be point of concentration of choosing workers. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the fact that personal characteristics should be focused on instead of degrees and achievements during employment."
9627,Some people believe that exams are inappropriate way of measuring students performance and should be replaced by continue assessment. Do you agree or disagree for this view?,"Nowadays, many individuals thought that exams are an unsuitable way of knowing the ability of a student, they suggested that there's should be a continuity assessment given. This essay agrees on the topic given. You cannot measure the knowledge of a person by giving an exam but by observing throughout the process of practicum and journey. Ċ Firstly, having a test is fine to assess the learning of a person. For example, in my country, you cannot use your degree and have a license if you cannot pass the exam given by the national. Similarly,with nurses, they studied for four years and they will be evaluated of all their learnings in two days of exams. Moreover, the students will study hard to pass the said exams but after finishing the test, some of them forgot all the things they studied, because they did that just to pass not for the future purpose. So, during the field of work,many didn't perform well. Ċ On the other hand, measuring one's knowledge by doing an exam is inappropriate of how to measure its performance. Practicality and practicum are one of the assessments that should be continued. For instance, a teacher, they cannot just rely on the book and the four years of schooling on how to deal with the students, but instead, when they are in the classroom, they could learn some ideas that they never learned during college days. Therefore, having a practicum is one way of measuring students performance. Ċ In conclusion, measuring the learning of a person is not just based on an exam but also in practicality which can be assessed continually during the process."
9628,Some people think that criminal behaviour has genetic causes. Others believe that it is circumstances that lead people to commit a crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Through the centuries, society debated the origins of criminal behaviour. Many people believe that the root of unlawful habits relies on genetic, physical characteristics. While others claim that crime is a behaviour that depends on the circumstances and background of the perpetrator. In this essay, I will thoroughly explore both viewpoints and provide my opinion. Ċ From antiquity to the present day, people assume that the misconduct it brings breaks social rules lies under the physical condition of the offender. Under those circumstances, minorities, people with some disability or without good looks were labelled as suspects or potential criminals. Recently, with genetic studies and DNA discovery, some researchers tried to find a correlation between law infringement and genetics. To date, no one has proven any one person's genetic propensity for crime. Although the failure of some genes can lead to mental disorders, for example, these problems still do not make a person a delinquent, not to mention that criminals do not necessarily have any mental issues, the reason why I do not support this viewpoint.  Ċ On the other hand, we have theories that consider the background and social reach of those who commit some type of felony.  According to related studies, criminal behaviour is not an inherited trait, but actuallyAdd a comma,actuallyIt appears that you are missing a comma after the introductory phrase actually. Consider adding a comma. Ċ show examples a condition that might be practised by any person, independently of their ethnicity, disorder  or any  other physical attributes. Forthwith, exposure to crime, either by relatives or peers, have a person frustrated with  his or her social condition an option to commit delicts. Equally important, in scenarios of severe poverty and social instability, it is possible to see individuals of a wide variety of aspects committing some sort of law offence.  Therefore, I support this perspective, because crime is an attitude that is learned rather than born.  Ċ In conclusion, I strongly believe that criminals are not determined to this type of conduct from birth. Instead, the social environment of a person can influence his or her choice to commit transgressions. For this reason, society and law enforcement officers must be educated to avoid any discrimination against individuals from ethnic minorities or those with a disability."
9629,More and more people claim that modern work patterns are a source of stress. What do you think are the causes of this? Can you suggest some possible solution?,"It is hard to imagine a world in which everyone is satisfied with their job. Many people work in order to earn money to pay their expensive such as the cost of living, mortgage. These expenditures have greater concern than job satisfaction. It is believed that the majority of people dislike their job and unhappy about the adverse working conditions. Ċ First of all, it is no matter if you are an unskilled, blue-collar worker in a manufacturing industry or a white-collar worker in service industry job security are concern both with the knowledge that you may lose your job any time does not make you feel happy. Ċ Moreover, in many cases the employers put a lot of pressure on employees or the job is so demanding that takes over your life and working unsociable hours makes you neglect your family and friends. Another negative factor is a physical job where you do the same job every day then you end up with physical injury or nowadays called ""repetitive strain injury"". Ċ With all these negative factors it is hard to believe that there is any solution. Money is a good motivator as everyone want a good salary. A good work/life balance can improve job satisfaction. For example provide an incremental scheme or perks such as free lunch or a car can make a difference to make a job worthwhile. Ċ Unfortunately it is not easy to find a decent job. It also a solution to forget the office and factory work and become self-employed and work for yourself. It offers freedom and flexibility"
9630,IELTS Writing Task 2.. You should spend 40 minutes on this task. Do you support that the nuclear technology should be used for constructive purposes?  Use your own knowledge and experience and support your argument with examples and relevant evidence. Give reasons for your viewpoint.,"Nuclear Energy has been globally spoken for the past few years. Some people argue that the nuclear technology could be used for the sake of development. It can be true but I totally disagree of this idea and in this essay I will support my opinion with examples. Ċ Primarily, nuclear accident is one of the main concern regarding the use of nuclear technology. Despite the high level of sophistication of safety system that the technology have, human and environmental aspects  always get the impact when unexpected event occured. For example, chernobyl nuclear accident which was claim as the worse nuclear accident ever cause a mass sacriface of humankind and environment. Another reason is that there is some difficulties in the management of nuclear waste which takes many years to eliminate its radioactive and risk. It will also have a bad impact for the surrounding if the waste poorly manage. Ċ In contrary, people believe that nuclear could be beneficial for advancing several medical technology. For instance, the invention of radiopharmaceutical and radiation therapy technique for the treatment of malignant tumors. Ċ In conclusion, although there is a chance to expant nuclear technology, I believe that it is too dangerous to implement it without putting human and enviroment in line. Personally, I think that another alternative technology which is much safer should be discovered and implemented."
9631,"Some people like to buy new phones, new desktop or other latest devices. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is a common phenomenon today that is using the latest technological products become a fashion, thus more and more consumers prefer to buy the latest smartphones, computers and other devices. In my opinion, this behaviour could bring both positive and negative developments to the society. Ċ On one hand, citizens like purchase the latest electrical goods could establish a good cycle of national economy growth and technology advancements. Firstly, a frequent consuming action will increase the profits of relative manufacturers and developers. Secondly, the huge demand of the market will create more jobs in producing products to meet its requirements, thus the individuals income rise. At the same time, the government could gain more tax, which means they have more funds to spend on developing of various aspects, such as education, technology and science. Finally, both soft and hard power increased by the population of scientific and technological talents and new product growth. Ċ On the other hand, everything has two sides, when consumers are keeping replace still working devices with new items frequently, that could cause a huge waste of resources and money. For a common individual, neither a new smartphone or computer are not cheap, which might cost them a few weeks salary. If they always change those items might cause them some troubles, such as a personal financial crisis. Moreover, it also could lead certain environmental problems, such as populations, because some of the materials used to make electrical products are non-recyclable. The battery is a good example, it not only non-recyclable, but also could endanger the environment when it is mishandled. Ċ In conclusion, this consuming habit is a double sword, which could bring benefits of economic growth and development, and could cause a big waste and population as well. Therefore, if we want to achieve the best interest have to find the balance between the both positive and negative effects."
9632,Some people feel that global warming should be dealt with by governments. Others feel that it is responsibility of individuals in society to solve the problem. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"To reduce the increased temperature due to human activities on earth must be halted with higher authorities, precisely governments. While this notion is favoured by some parts of society, there are others who have counter-argument to tackle the serious issue; citizens have their responsibility to take action on their own. I personally believe that both have an important role to stop this pressing problem. In this essay, I will discuss both views in detail. Ċ To begin with, governments play a vital role in maintaining the environment safe and healthy. They have the authority to order laws and regulations in order to decrease the level of warming. Take an example, setting a regulation of usage of water or scarce resources for manufacturing companies may reduce the green effect. On top of that, it is possible to let companies switch to more environmentally-friendly ways of manufacturing using renewable energy such as solar power or wind power as well. Ċ On the other hand, it is undeniable that each individual is equally responsible for protecting their own neighbourhood. There are several ways that each citizen can do to participate in improving the ecological situation. For instance, the usage of cars and their exhaust gases are considered to be a major source of air pollution. People would be able to protect our environment by choosing public transportations or cycling, instead of using own cars all the time. Additionally, it is effective to switch off lights when they are not needed. Although these individual actions seem minor, the cumulative effect of everyone taking those actions would be enormous. Ċ To sum up, I believe the combined approach of both government and individuals will work most effectively in order to solve the global warming problem and save our planet for future generations."
9633,"In many countries, people are moving away from rural areas towards urban areas. Ċ Why do you think that is? Ċ What problems can it cause?","Due to urbanization, people in various countries interested to move from the countryside to the cityside. It is nowadays common among every part of the world. In my point of view, there are various reasons behind this cause. In the upcoming paragraphs, I will elaborate on the reasons and problems caused due to the migration process. Ċ To begin with, many people are migrating from rural community to urban area due to several reasons. Firstly, It gives chance to grow better in cities. In other words, employment opportunities are limited in the countryside and communities are dependent on agriculture and farming. Nowadays, white colour jobs provide more income to employees but these are not available in villages. Therefore, lack of management and research work in rural area compel most of the youth to move towards cities. Secondly, the standard of living, educational, transport and other facilities attract people to get shifted in the metropolis. Consequently, to attain the best higher education and bright future they prefer to move towards urban areas. Ċ However, it too has few drawbacks which are affecting the society. Primarily, youth nowadays are ignoring their family business of agriculture. For instance, in order to spend the city luxurious life, they do not want to do agriculture in their field as well as other family business. They are more interested in doing jobs. Hence, it is affecting the traditional business in the rural area and will obsolete soon in the coming future. Secondarily, there is a juvenile who at the sake of higher studies takes money from their parents and spend it on the drugs and discs in the cities. In order to show their status symbol,they roam around in the city on luxury cars and carrier is spoiled. Ċ To conclude, although there are several positive causes of migration from rural to urban areas such as higher studies, better career and better life standard yet it has problems associated with it like population increase and obsoletion of traditional businesses."
9634,"It has been suggested that everyone in the world wants to own a car, a TV and a fridge. Do you think the disadvantages of such is a development outweigh its advantages?","Some people believe that technological innovations and tools, such as automobiles, televisions, and refrigerators, can bring huge benefits to our lives, therefore everyone should own them. I personally think that they also can bring some side effects. However, the benefits far outweigh its drawbacks. Ċ There are several merits of having those technologies as they can improve our efficiency, vision, and health condition. The vehicle is one of the most significant innovations to modern society because it can enhance one's productivity by saving his or her time commuting from home to office. Moreover, ensuring everyone shows up to work on time can help companies and stores provide products and services in a timely manner, which can boost the efficiency and economy of our society. Other than cars, news and documentaries that are informative showing on televisions can broaden our minds and perspectives, while TV series and comedies that are entertaining can kill and boredom and fatigue from our hectic lives. Additionally, a fridge is also an important piece of equipment that is essential to our health as it can keep the food fresh and prevent them from rotting. Ċ There are some drawbacks if people use these tools too often. First of all, cars are the main factor of greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide emitted while driving can raise the global temperature and cause catastrophic natural disasters like floods and tornadoes. Secondly, the refrigerator can adversely impact our environment as well. The ozone sphere of the earth can be damaged by the air generated by the fridge, which makes it another contributor to global warming. However, the government is investing money and scientists are devoting their time to new technologies that can alleviate these issues. For instance, electronic cars and eco-friendly fridges are widely used nowadays. Ċ In conclusion, technological inventions can significantly improve the quality of our daily lives and the efficiency of society. However, overusing these tools can damage our environment, this issue can be addressed by the government and scientists though."
9635,Question: Living standards in cities are much higher than those in rural areas. Why do you think this is so? What do you propose to improve the living standards of people in rural areas?,"Cities are large and densely populated area, whereas villages are rustic and focus on only on agriculture. The standard of living in the urban region is much better and complicated than it is there in countryside. This essay focuses on the reasons for this statement and also the possible measures to amend the lifestyles of the agrarian life. Ċ The main reason for the good standard of living in the metropolis is the effect of the inter-mixing of multi-cultural communities. A city is a combination of both aboriginal and alien cultures, which causes the adaptation of many good lifestyles among the dwellers. Moreover, the urban area comprises of many good educational institutions, well-developed communication facilities, which are also instrumental in the betterment of the living standards. Ċ However, rural communities are mainly relay on agriculture as a means of livelihood than on any business or co-operate jobs. So the scene of living standard in this folksy culture is just opposite to what we see in an urban life. Ċ By implementing several measures, the rural standards can be improved. Establishing basic educational facilities for the children in the villages helps a lot. For instance, many villages in India still suffer from illiteracy due to the lack of elementary educational institutions. So literacy plays a major role in developing a well-standard community in countryside. In addition to that, the accessibility of communication facilities and media, such as television, newspaper and the internet are also highly backing in terms of improving the living standards. Ċ From the above statements, it is clear that there is a great gap in between the living standards of the people of cities and villages. So it is crucial to provide essential concerns on the development of rural culture in order to develop the whole nation."
9636,Some people think that exercise is the key to health while others feel that having a balanced diet is more important. Discuss both sides and give your opinion. healthy diet and exercises - both crucial for health,"It is commonly believed that the way toward being healthy is by doing the workout. Which leads to others consider that a regular balanced eating habit is far more crucial. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and present my opinion to this discussion below. Ċ On the one hand, some think that the most effective way to health is by doing exercise. In other words, exercise helps one's body consume the food and convert them into energy as well as expel the toxins by sweating it out. As a result, it keeps one body's system working properly while kicking toxins out of one's body. Ċ On the other hand, others believe that it is far more important to have a right proportion of eating habit. Particularly, having a balanced diet would avoid the negative effect of intaking exceeded one particular substance from the food and therefore, it would keep one's body stay healthy by getting all the good nutrients from a wide variety of food. Ċ Finally, I consider that doing exercise regularly and keeping a healthy diet is equally important. Specifically, by only exercising without giving up on junk food or overly consumed sugar or salt in food would eventually lead to diabetes. Nevertheless, merely regulating the eating habit without a structural and consistent workout schedule would easily suffer any form of heart diseases as its heart muscles are not strong enough to withstand the sudden pressure that might occur in everyday life. Ċ In conclusion, while exercise could help a body function properly. A healthy diet could avoid consuming one specific substance in food excessively. And I suggest that they are both crucial in health because without either one of its habits, which would potentially induce some serious diseases to a person."
9637,Topic: Most schools offer some types of physical education programs to their students. Why is physical education important? Should physical education classes be optional or required? physical education benefits,"Nowadays, students are required to take more and more hours studying at school. Besides theoretical classes, most schools also offer physical education classes. Despite great benefits that physical education provides to both physical and mental health of students, schools should only categorize it as a recommended option rather than a required class. Ċ The most obvious effect that physical education does to a student is giving the child a healthy body. By taking exercises or playing sports regularly, children can burn calories and strengthen their muscles. From doing regular exercises at school, students will form a good habit of working out at home to maintain a healthy lifestyle. In addition, a good health also prevents students from serious illnesses, such as diabetes, heart diseases, and so on. Ċ Furthermore, physical activities contribute significantly to a positive mental health. With a fit body, students will be more confident, energetic and optimistic. Besides, they can release stress after long studying hours by playing a sports game with friends, which helps them gain their motivation to get back to study better. Ċ Even though physical education classes are of great importance, many students may not receive the benefits fully. This is because each person's physical condition is unique so that one training program cannot be suitable and safe for everybody. On the other hand, playing a sport effectively requires both players' interest and some natural skills. Hence, students will not be able to enjoy a class that offers the sport that they do not like, or they may fail sports tests that require natural skills which they do not possess. Therefore, schools should only promote physical education as an optional class with valuable benefits and encourage students to take part in."
9638,6. (31/01/2015) Some people say that too much attention and too many resources are given in the protection of wild animals and birds. Do you agree or disagree about this opinion?,"It is argued that protecting wild animals and birds is drawing/attracting too much concern and too many resources of society. Personally, I totally agree with this point of view. Ċ There are two main reasons why I think people have paid too much attention to the protection of animals. One reason is that many non-governmental organizations have been established in order to protect animals all over the world. However, they are too concerned about animal-related activities in many parts of the world. For example, it is unreasonable that PETA, an animal-protecting organization, accused Katy Perry of using tigers and elephants in her own music video ‘Roar’ for commercial purposes while she did not. Furthermore, news about wild animals can be shared rapidly on the Internet. If a bear is imprisoned somewhere, this news will be widespread on social networks such as Facebook on a large scale immediately. Ċ In addition, people have also spent too many resources protecting wild birds. Firstly, a great deal of money is required to carry out any project to protect wild birds, in which infrastructure and research are the two most expensive. The more difficult research to preserve the DNA of wild birds is, the more it costs. Secondly, the expenditure for this protection is quite unnecessary to some extent. While funds should be raised to improve the living standards in some regions, investment in bird protection appears to be a waste of money. Ċ In conclusion, it seems to me that both concern and resources are focused too much on the protection of wild animals and birds in this modern world."
9639,An increasing number of professionals such as doctors and teachers are leaving their own poorer countries to work in developed countries. What are the problems associated with and some possible solutions? Exodus of doctors and other specialists,"Professionals such as doctors and teachers from undeveloped countries are migrating to work in more developed countries. Due to this, poorer nations will struggle to develop, which will negatively affect the economy of the country. To tackle the issue, their government should offer better working conditions to them. Ċ The foremost problem faced by poorer nations due brain drain, in the fields such as medical science and education, is that they will struggle to develop and find difficult to boost the economy of the nation. The host country invested a lot of money on the education of these professionals, but they do not back anything in return and migrate to rich countries when their turn comes. As a consequence, these nations face the crisis of the economy, and remain undeveloped with respect to education and medicines. Ċ In order to address this problem, the government should encourage these professionals to stay there by offering them a better working conditions. This can be done by allocating additional budget towards these professions and increase their wages to a competent level because they deserve it for their hard work in these fields. For example, Canada, one of highest paying nations for doctors, to maintain the level of service, therefore, their doctors are not immigrating to any other country. Ċ In conclusion, although developing nations face a variety of problems and one of them is deterioration in development due to migration of professionals, this problem is not insurmountable. In my view, it is the government responsibility to tackle that issue by offering a pleasurable working environment, they should begin by considering one of the proposed solutions above."
9640,Many books have been made into films. Some people say that it is better to watch the film rather than read the original book. Write an article giving your views about this issue Living through pages!,"After many books have been such a great success, they have been made into films. So there are people who believe that books are a waste of time & that movie son the other hand are much more enjoyable, while as many others - including myself - prefer reading the book itself. Ċ Firstly, books take between three days and week to be read. This makes people more attahed to the book and to each of its characters, which in turn makes the book a part of the reader's life. Accordingly, the story becomes more enjoyable by the reader & gives him a closer look to the events of the story, which makes both of the happy & sad moments sacred and priceless. Ċ Second of all, are nearly two hours, and so the producer of the movie will be forced to delete many scenes, which is very frustrationg. Actually many people noticed that in several movies including Great Expectations by Charles Dickens. The books was way more enjoyable; the book was written in very fine details which made the reader feel the happenings as if he were himself living the story. He could actually imagine the characters in his own world and know their thoughts too! Ċ To sum up, movies might let you see the movies with your own eyes, but the book cooperates with your heart and mind so that you could live the story!"
9641,Some people claim that young people are more creative than older people in business or in the workplace. Do you agree or diagree with this?,"Nowadays, in our modern society, it is a common belief that elder workers are much less creative than those who are younger or new in business. This strange and absurd point of view had caused many companies and industries to discard experienced and skillful workers just because they are old. Both young and old people contribute to our society in different ways. Ċ These days, the young are favored by many companies for their excellent ability to deal with the most sophiticated technologies, which allows them to catch up the newest aspects. They are also generally open minded and tends to adopt and develop new ideas. What is more, they are mostly well experienced in computers and other modern gadgets which help them develop necessary skills in using hardware or software to produce amazing pieces of work. However, young people usually are irresponsible or unreliable since they lack responsibilities such as paying tax, managing family spendings or a family to take care of. They often find excuses like ""sickness"" to have a few days off, making them untrust worthy. Ċ Older workers, on the other hand, are more experienced for all the lessos they gathered from their earlier days. They are known to be considerate and wise for they has solved problems in life. Many old people had to support their children's economy and managing their own so they are much more responsible. Nevertheless, they lack the skills and ability to adapt to changes which makes them less creative and fear to take risks or challenges. Ċ To sum up, everyone is good but in different aspects. It is our job to help workers rise to their full potential."
9642,"Many people are moving from rural areas to big cities, why has this happened? Ċ To what extend do you think it is a good trend?","It is true that many countries have experienced a significant movement of population to urban areas. There are various factors behind this trend, but I believe it can lead to a challenge on the whole social development. Ċ It seems to be two main reasons why those people have made this decision. Firstly, cities are densely populated and there are more job opportunities available, so migrants may earn more money. This means that they can afford more customer goods and improve living standards. In contrast,employment opportunities are scarce in the countryside, due to the fact that many industries are under development and the inhabitants' buying power is limited. Secondly, city dwellers have easy access to public services, such as healthcare and education; hence, they can enjoy a better quality of life. For example, young couples who used to live in the countryside intend to send their children to good schools in metros, so as to break the cycle of poverty. Ċ From my perspective, the rural-to-urban shift may put an adverse impact on the development of cities and rural areas. To begin with, the increased number of urban dwellers will bring huge pressure on housing and transportation in cities. More specifically, some cities are unable to accommodate large populations due to the shortage of land; therefore, traffic congestion and the highest housing prices will be the problems. Moreover, since young people who are ambitious, energetic and creative prefer to go to the metro, the rural communities will be lack of labour force. Because of this, the rural-urban income disparity will grow, and the rural economics will be more sluggish. Ċ To sum up, more employment opportunities and better public services are the main factors that attract people to migrate to cities. In my view, it will be a worrying trend."
9643,The world should have only one government rather than a national government for each country.Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"Lately, various people tend to be unified under a one-world government than to be governed by themselves. It is believed that this trend has more merits than its drawbacks. In this essay, I will examine both sides and reach a conclusion. Ċ On the one hand, there are distinct benefits to being unified under single world governance. Firstly, the one world-state makes national borders redundant, leading to the freedom of transportation. For instance, flying to an unusual or cosmopolitan destination every weekend for vacation would be far more feasible. In addition, nations with the same leadership have the possibility to follow the same guidelines and restrictions, which are entirely uniform over the world. As a result, not only do individuals share identical rights, but they also have a sense of interconnection and association. Ċ On the other hand, this scenario may also have more downsides than predicted. One of the most popular disadvantages is that the residents have to physically concentrate at a location when they are ruled by a world administration. Hence, the further individuals are from the bureaucrats, the more likely they are to be affected by their decisions. Furthermore, as the concept of nations ceases to exist, then external threats remarkably increase. In other words, conflicts would undoubtedly arise or culturally and historically diversity that the council is not able to address all of them at the root. Ċ In conclusion, although having a central regime in the globe has good points, it seems to me that this trend still has negative influences on mankind."
9644,Some people think that advertising on TV is useless and others disagree. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"There is a debate between two different groups about whether promotion on TV has any benefit, while others disagree with this hypothesis. This essay discusses both sides of this argument and why I believe that advertisement on TV has many advantages. Ċ There are two main reasons why there is a group that believes that media owners should remove promotions from their establishment is because that televisions had created for the purpose of entertainment. Thus, all the contents and programmes must be aligned with that purpose which is to entertain viewers from all over the world. Furthermore, no one would want to be interrupted by an advertisement when they are watching a movie with their family this is because it might distract the momentum. Moreover, many businessmen have agreed that advertising on television is an obsolete method, and this is due to social media. From a business viewpoint, firms started to shift their spending for marketing from TVs to platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Tiktok. Ċ On the other hand, there is a consensus that believes that monetization on TV is favourable. Additionally, the first reason why this group holds this notion is that promotions might educate people. Not to mention, sometimes advertisers promote products that could enhance the well-being of people and might save individuals life. Despite the fact, that there were many great innovations no one knew about them until they were promoted on TV. As well as this, another good reason that sometimes advertisements might create cultural trends; this is to say, that these promotions will become part of someone's nostalgia. For example, many people will not forget the advertisement that was produced by Pepsi in the 2000s, the ""What up!"". Ċ In conclusion, I believe that both sides have merits. On balance, however, it is my opinion that I completely agree with the side that thinks that monetization on television is not useless. This is because these promotions could educate people on products that could make their life more efficient and easier."
9645,"Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. Other, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Others argue that imposing stricter punishments is vital in order to lessen traffic accidents. Meanwhile, some believe that there are other methods for road safety improvement. In this essay, I will be discussing both views and arrive at a conclusion before expressing my opinion. Ċ On the one hand, road users will develop discipline because of being afraid of punishment. For example, in the City of Manila, a contactless apprehension is being implemented, wherein violators are penalized not by police officers but by surveillance cameras. If a driver violates a traffic regulation such as speeding, he or she will receive a violation ticket directly in the mail. As a result, he or she will become more careful in using the roads next time to avoid being automatically penalized by cameras. Ċ On the other hand, there are other means to improve safety in the streets. For instance, government and non-government organizations may offer workshops that tackle defensive driving, common road signs, and proper driving etiquette. Focus on these would not only enhance the skills of the road users but would also promote awareness. Furthermore, they can exchange knowledge on the proper measures to avoid accidents. Ċ In conclusion, there is an argument on whether imposing stricter punishments or other options would effectively reduce road accidents. If drivers become disciplined and avoid committing violations, there will be fewer accidents. However, there are various seminars that people can attend to develop their skills. In my opinion, it is better to offer a wide range of measures to raise awareness of the drivers to improve safety on the road."
9646,"Some people feel that boarding schools (where students or pupils live at the school during the term) are an excellent option for children, while other people disagree for a number of reasons. Consider both sides of this debate and reach a conclusion. children life at dormitory","Argued that pupils living at boarding house will be better than other places. Meanwhile, other societies disagree concern this argument because of many reasons. This essay will discuss the debate and give a concluding view. Ċ On the one hand, live at barracks will grow up children`s emotional maturity. Because they will learn how to live independently without depending on the parent. For instance, after finishing study at school they should also portion out time to another activity like cooking, eating, reading Qur'an, and washing. Besides, they are also smart to manage outcome and income during the stay in there. For this case, this encourages their idea and emotional to grow more adult than before. Thus, they will have a great personality Ċ On the other hand, another argument assumes that life at boarding house is the hazard to their life. Because of without parents, nobody controlling their behavior causes student`s habit nastier. For example, they will have opportunities to spend time such as hang out, playing a game, and taking a rest. This will reduce their personality, and even it can disappear identity. Furthermore, children`s age still tending label will support to shape becoming criminal human. As a result, live at boarding house will be difficult in developing them, and home is really better for their life. Ċ Overall, it appears that life at dormitory has not determined a better result for children, for without parent`s attendance will cause their life in danger, and it is one of crucial thing in their future. Thus, to shape the independent child should build the clear relation between home and boarding house."
9647,Unlimited car use has brought us a lot of problems. What are these problems? And should we discourage people from using cars?,"As the living standard continues to improve, more people nowadays can afford a car for their daily commute. While we are enjoying the convenience and flexibility brought by this transport mode, we also have to suffer from the side effects that come with it. Ċ One of the biggest problems caused by the overuse of cars is traffic congestion. This is especially the case in megacities like Beijing. With the number of cars increasing at an astonishing rate, the road system, however, has not been upgraded to meed the growing demand. As a result, in rush hours everyday, the main roads in these cities is jammed by cars. Sometimes, it can take up to several hours for the commuters just to get from home to work. Ċ Another problem is the impact of car emission on the atmosphere. The exhausted gas from the burning fossil fuel contains CO2 which is well known for its contribution to the global warming. In fact, traffic jam is amplifying such a situation as more CO2 will be emitted into the air when those cars are waiting in lines with their engines on rather than running at full speed. Ċ To solve these problems, I believe the use of cars should be discouraged and even be limited. However, before that, governments should provide the general public with better alternatives. For example, subways or light rails can divert the traffic flow but they do not occupy traffic lanes as buses do. Ċ To sum up, I think unlimited car use have indeed brought us many troubles. To address these issues, control and reduction of the number of cars on the street is a must."
9648,Computer games is very popular in all ages and nations. Parent think it has little educational Ċ Value and more harmful effects. What is your opinion about this? Give example based on your own experience.,"With the advance of technology computer games' popularity started to skyrocket. However, some controversy remains regarding this matter. Parents might argue that negative side-effects may derive from playing and that it is just a waste of time. As a gamer myself I will present a strong contrary point, explaining why they help us to develop important skills and strengthen our social relationships. Ċ Firstly, videogames frequently present a person with numerous puzzles, challenges and all sorts of situations. These aspects allow us to develop strong critical thinking skills which come to be of help in real-life situations as well. By having faced several challenges before, a person can feel more confident and prepared to face actual hardships during life. Secondly, playing creates a perfect environment to practice a new language. As a native Portuguese speaker, they had a crucial part in helping me gain vocabulary in English and Spanish. Ċ PC games not only help to develop skills as explained above but let us also consider the social aspect that they present. Many of the modern ones are connected to the internet, thus allowing players to communicate with people all over the world. The social interaction in this kind of environment is certainly positive because it helps to develop aspects like teamwork, communication and leadership, which can be very handy later on in life. Aside from that, playing has become something so common nowadays that those who do not engage in this activity can often feel excluded. For example, a child that has no access to these entertainment titles might feel left out from their friends' circle due to the lack of common topics to chat about. Ċ In conclusion, computer games are a valuable resource as a means for personal development, entertainment and strengthening of social bonds. Therefore, they should not be seen as having negative aspects or even useless. After the analysis presented on this essay parents should start to understand better these benefits and adapt to our current times as quickly as possible because videogames are definitely coming to stay."
9649,"As the world becomes technologically advanced, computers are replacing more and more jobs. Describe some job positions that may be lost because of computers and discuss at one problem that may result.","With the scientific breakthrough, machines are taking the place of employees in many sectors. This essay will mention some of the occupations that are now done by the software instead of humans and discuss one of the severe problems, which is gradually increasing because of this change. Ċ Many intellectual and menial jobs are now done by computers. These are mainly the positions of salesman, teacher and cashier. Nowadays, people are keen on purchasing from online stores, where items with details are exhibited in the webpages; unlike a physical shop, in an online store, limited moderators are required to sell the goods. Likewise, distance learning is very popular among students. As a result, many educational institutions are closing with the passage of time, and mentors are losing their positions. Moreover, in the bank, tellers are no longer needed as such task is easily done by note-counting-machine efficiently. For instance, a recent survey conducted by Wikipedia reveals that more than 30% of seller lost their employments because of the growth of the -commerce sector. Ċ However, this trend is promoting unemployment. Because, many tasks which were done by human labour, are now performed by software-based-system with less effort and time. Hence, many professionals are dropping out as employers are no longer recruiting labours to perform that. As the advancement of technology is continuing, the rate of unemployment is also growing, which is letting many persons in a measurable life. Many of these jobless people are taking illegal ways to earn their livelihood, which is affecting the society. For example, in Bangladesh, criminal activity is growing among the workless people. Ċ In conclusion, with the progress of science, many professions are replacing by robots and technical devices. Especially, the service holders of business, education and account department are replacing more than others. Nevertheless, it is escalating the number of workless persons in the community."
9650,Some scientists believe that they can tell whether a child will grow up to be a criminal by studying his or her behavior at the age of three. What is your opinion?,"In recent years tremendous advancements have been occurred in various fields of science and crime detection is one. By help of these improvements it is claimed that scientist can predict the child's potential to become criminal in early childhood. In my opinion it can't be a reasonable and beneficial trend. Ċ First of all there are several environmental factors that turn a human to a criminal and the childhood behavior doesn't play an important role. When studying the life story of thieves, killers, offenders, it is observed that their bad family condition, hunger, poverty and being bad treated are the key elements leading them to nasty and crimes. Although by studying their early ages it can be seen that most of them haven't shown different behaviors and attitudes than the other children and it has been just the life's conditions that have made them criminals. Ċ Moreover, it is not fair to label a child as a potential criminal. Their acts and actions are just formed according to their parent's behavior and what they learn in their family. Most of small children that show inappropriate behavior grow up in families that parents are not aware of the roles of raising a child and so they show some misbehavior. It is obvious that knowing them as a potential criminal and separating from others is not fair and will have negative effects on their feeling. Ċ In conclusion considering the facts that children's behavior in childhood doesn't have any relation with possibility of becoming a criminal in future and also unfairness of considering some children as future criminals I am completely against of the idea of finding and investigating future criminals by analyzing childhood behavior."
9651,"Why patients must rely less on doctors Topic : These days, too many people maintain their health by relying on doctors and medicine, rather than by following a healthy lifestyle. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Writing","Healthcare improvements have reduced the risk of so many serious illnesses that people nowadays tend to depend on their services. In fact, the values of keeping in shape is almost forgotten. I agree that doctors and medicine are considered to be the best method throughout the world today. Ċ Firstly, well-qualified doctors and the scientific researches on pharmaceuticals reassure people. It takes at least 5 or 6 years training to become a doctor and also scientists have to do many experiments on the medicine before putting it into uses. For example, the rubella vaccine is widely used around the world after 10-year study. Thanks to its application, 95% of the world population have been saved. It is clear that patients feel secure when they follow the advice of doctors to cure their disease. Ċ Secondly, building a healthy routine requires a lot of time and efforts while taking medicine helps people recover in a short period. Fitness centers have been established every corner of one city and attracted many people. However, they often give up after 1 month joining the sports centers because they get frustrated waiting for changes on their bodies. According to Queen's University's survey, only 10% participants continued the training course after the first month in SO gym. Obviously, people have a tendency to choose the easier path to keep fit which is making appointments with doctors rather than spending time to do exercise regularly. Ċ In conclusion, the majority invest for health by taking medical care and pharmaceutical products instead of following healthy habits these days. I think it would be better if people participate in a health course or a sport club that helps to prevent illnesses because sometimes sickness cannot be cured."
9652,"In major cities around the world, traffic congestion has become a serious problem. How can this problem be tackled? Give reasons and examples from your own experience","Traffic congestion is an enormous issue for big urban cities in the whole world and it is directly affecting all individual's life who are living in these places. Even though this problem has a big magnitude, but still there are a few affordable solutions, like an improvement in the main road's infrastructure system and by the introduction of more public transport to the public. The essay will further discuss both facets of a proposal with appropriate examples and reaches a logical conclusion. Ċ To begin with, the most effective solution is an amelioration of roads and highways in big cities that can definitely help to mitigate the problem. Although, there are roads in every city, but making more tunnels and flyovers would reduce the traffic jams because people start using these facilities without hassles. For example, In Delhi the government solved 50% of the complication by constructing more roads and tunnels in the city. Ċ Additionally, there is one more significant solution available is providing a flexible public transportation system to the community. However, people are using their own transportation because some time there is no public transit available for them that compel them to buy their own vehicle, if the authority should make the public transit flexible and affordable for all of them then people would stop using private vehicles which could directly reduce the congestions. For instance, in Mumbai the council runs a more frequent service in the morning or evening, which puts the trivial impact on the travel amount of the city. Ċ In conclusion, unavailability of public transport and roads are the primary cause of this horrific trouble, so enhancement of these sectors could alleviate the issues. The government should spend more money in these areas, so people would not suffer more."
9653,Obesity is increasing in many developing countries affecting the children. What are some possible reasons for this and suggest possible solutions,"It has been observed that there is a dramatic rise in the number of obese children in third world countries. This can be attributed to the involvement in several sedentary activities, lack of sports, and increased consumption of junk food. Solutions have been identified for this problem. Ċ To begin, one major cause of this unhealthy state is increased participation of school children in sedentary activities such as watching television and playing video games. These activities increase energy conservation, which eventually results in excessive weight gain. Also, lack of physical exercise is another point to consider. Most elementary and secondary school's curricula do not include exercises, and as such, putting them at risk of gaining weight. Additionally, several fast food stores exist in street corners in these developing countries, with their adverts targeted towards enticing children to purchase them. Furthermore, parents are often working long hours, with inadequate time to make healthy meals for their wards, and thus, leaving them at the mercy of these junk food shops. To illustrate, it was noted in Rwanda, a developing nation, that most school children now ingest foods containing higher quantities of unhealthy oils than they did in the past. Ċ However, there are measures that can be taken to combat this menace. Firstly, parents ought to restrict the duration spent by their wards engaging in sedentary acts, while also ensuring that time is set aside to prepare healthy meals. This method, for instance, has been introduced in some developed nations of the world like the United Kingdom, where families are mandated to consume at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily. Also, academic settings should include at least 30 minutes of aerobics to help children lose weight. The government can also place a ban on adverts focused on these growing leaders. Ċ In conclusion, although obesity is an issue with several causes, engaging in sports, healthy living in families, and the government's prohibition of misleading adverts are some ways to curb this growing problem. It is hoped that many people, including children, will focus on living a healthy life."
9654,"Around the world,it is likely that more adults will work from home and more children Will study from home as computer technology becomes cheap and more accessible. Do you think it is a negative or positive development?","It is being assumed that a large number of adults and children in various parts of the world will prefer home-based education and working due to having inexpensive and handy computer technology. In my opinion, this development would have negative effects on the professional abilities of people and nurturing of skills of children. Ċ One main problem that can arise from in-house working is that, workers will have a less favourable working environment for their skill to thrive. For instance, being employed in an organisation, people often experience face to face interaction with their colleagues, which is imperative for their better social life style. This will helps them to polish their professional skills by indulging themselves into various training workshops held by the companies they are working for. However, working from home would be ineffective in creating an environment for an adult worker to progress in the field. Ċ Another point to consider is that home-schooling would offer only a limited benefit to students, but its negative effects are long lasting. To illustrate, children studying at school will have several advantages such as, it provides an opportunity to improve their cognitive and communication skills, while having daily interaction with the peers and teachers. Hence, children will be able to develop confidence and self-esteem which is crucial for their working career. In other words, staying at home will usually make them an introvert and also, they will require more time in the future to get settled in their professional life. Ċ In conclusion, having cheaper and easy access to virtual technology, more adults and children are expected to be staying at home for the purpose of studying and working all over the globe. In my view, this type if development has brought about many negative effects to be considered it as a positive trend."
9655,many people are now spending more and more time travelling to work or school. some people believe that this is a negative development while others think there are some benefits. discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Time is the most precious thing we have nowadays. Individuals are travelling far for their work and education. I believe there are more disadvantages than advantages to this. This essay will discuss both the viewpoints. Ċ On the one hand, there are people who argue that commuting greater distances is beneficial. They think one might read a book or listen to a podcast while travelling. I feel this can be done better at home, where you are relaxed, and more concentrated. This is because you are not distracted by traffic. For instance, while driving you have to pay attention to cars and pedestrians. Furthermore, when a person is multitasking while driving, the chances of accidents increases. In contrast, if a person is paying full attention to only driving, the probability of any mishap decreases. Ċ On the other hand, spending more time travelling wastes a lot of time. This is because an average person spends a couple of hours commuting. For example, if someone's school or workplace is 20KM away. It takes around an hour driving. This time could have been spent on more important things like spending time with your family. In addition, if you save this time, you get more to do things that matters like working or studying. Ċ To conclude, having your work closer to your home has more positives than negatives. You can enjoy life more by saving crucial time, and being safe on the road by not getting distracted. As a result, you are saving money because time is money these days."
9656,"Once children start school, teachers have more influence than parents on their intellectual and social development. Do you agree or disagree?","When a child enters school, the impact of the teacher becomes much stronger on the development of social skills and intellectual abilities than parents. I am afraid I have to disagree with this position due to the fact that parents for children are the standard of social relations, and they also have active domination in the acquisition of intellectual abilities. Ċ First of all, trust in parents is more significant because the kid feels the care of the parents and the relationship in the family, so he listens more to the parents' opinion and takes social patterns of behaviour as an example. The tutor, in this case, has an indirect force on the improvement of inter-social relations. For example, recent official reports from Princeton University on the study of family relations showed that adults have dominant importance on the gain of social and adaptive skills as opposed to teachers. Therefore, the tutor has the least impact on these improvements. Ċ Finally, parents help to do their homework, so this is a critical factor in the improvement of intellectual abilities as it involves parents in the active process of working on a task, so parents have more effect on the kid's mental abilities. In contrast, at school, the educator acts as the person who directs the learning and the kid listening passively on tasks. For instance, recent research from the University of Hamburg has confirmed that homeschooling and doing homework are active learning, which in turn prevails over passive classroom work and leads to more significant mental progress. Consequently, parents have a greater influence as they help with homework, which results. Ċ In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that I disagree that a teacher can have more influence than parents on intellectual and social ability, as parents from the above reasons are crucial and most priority figures in the advancement of these in a child."
9657,It is often considered that the change is more beneficial to people than trying to avoid it and have everything remain the same. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is important to consider the impact of change in one’s life. Although some people are of the opinion that there is no harm in leading a normal lifestyle without any changes, I believe the potential benefits of considering the change outweighs its drawbacks. Ċ To begin with the challenges, one of the main disadvantages in considering a variation is the disturbance it causes in having a systematic life. This is because following determined rules and pattern may help some of the people to lead a self-sustained and satisfying life. For instance, people with obsessive cleaning disorder often do not wish to observe any change in their regular activities. Alternatively, if there is any small disorientation in their plan, they believe that it may result in constant judgment from society and the consequences of such changes might end up in disappointment. Ċ However, these negatives can be outweighed by the positives like the personal and professional development of an individual. The reason for this is, every individual has an unseen version, which can be explored by adopting certain changes in our regular lifestyle. For example, during the lockdown phase, few people tried to explore the artistic side and started developing activities such as painting, dancing and cooking. Not only this helped them to realize their inner talent, but also made them feel more energetic and lively compared to their normal life. Furthermore, personal and professional changes provide different perceptions of a situation and in turn helps them to choose the best which can often bring successful results. Consequently, this would benefit them to get adjusted to any type of environment in the future. Ċ In conclusion, despite the breakage of systematic life pattern and disappointment caused by the method of making changes, my view is that individual development and a wide range of perceptions can be gained through such a process."
9658,More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people say that raising the price of fast foods will solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The issue of obesity is a serious health concern, especially for youngsters, as they are more exposed to a wide variety of ready-made meals. Regarding question whether increasing the cost of such foods will restrict people from buying, I completely disagree because prices do not seem to be the only encouraging factor as we shall see. Ċ To begin with, higher costs of junk food does not necessarily mean that people will not buy it, to satisfy their cravings. This means that people who are habitual will continue this pattern, despite the expensive prices of such foods. For example, fast food chains such as KFC, target children in their advertisement such as happy meals, force parents to fulfil the wishes of their loved ones. A better solution would be to improve the overall quality of such products by limiting the amount of preservatives and no compromise on the harmful ingredients they use. This will not only helpful for people, but also reduce the burden of healthcare facilities. Ċ Furthermore, the other major reason for the excessive consumption of fast food is the hectic schedules of people, as they are not able to spare time to cook for themselves. In such situations, higher prices will only affect their income rather than their usage of such foods. For instance, in Pakistan, working parents often opt for pre-cooked meals, rather than having a maid to cook for them and their children, because this would be a more expensive option than buying junk foods. This can be resolved only by providing awareness of the negative effects of such products, and allow more home-based tools such as rice-makers to ease the process of preparing meals. Ċ In conclusion, it is logical to accept that higher prices will restrict people’s access to fast foods. However, reforming the strategies for cooking at commercial outlets and subsidizing home-based cooking tools would appear to be much more effective to overcome this issue."
9659,Q: Millions of dollars are spent on space research every year. Some people argue that the money should be spent on improving living standards on Earth. Do you agree or disagree?,"Tremendous amount of money is being spent on scientific studies. And the biggest portion of this money is given to space researchers. It is disagreed that the money should be spent on improving the quality of life on Earth, instead of space research. This will be proven by analyzing the importance of discoveries in this area and grading living standards. Ċ The results of recent scientific researches of other planets changed the way humanity thinks of space. For example, NASA's robot found icebergs on poles of Mars, despite the fact that theory of Mars once having atmosphere that could be ideal for living had not been possible to be proven till that moment. If millions of dollars were not spent on space research, none of discoveries like this would be done. Thus it can not be said that amount of money spent on space research should be stripped down. Ċ Quality of life on Earth is increasing every year. This is very apparent when international research centres publish annual reports, according to which the number of people suffering from hunger or poverty is decreasing steadily. After analyzing this, it is clear that living standards on Earth are being improved without additional money. Ċ Following the analysis of results of works done by space researchers and increasing quality of life on Earth, it can be clearly seen that the quantity of money given to each area is fair. Further, it is expected that high living standards will allow government to spent more money on space research in order to discover new aspects of our space and colonize other planets. (265 words)"
9660,many people leave their home country and go to other countries to live and work. why do you think it is happening? do the advantages of this trend outweigh its disadvantages? the prompt: many people leave their home country and go to other countries to live and work.,"There is indeed a considerable number of people choosing to go to foreign nations to make a living and settle in these places. There could be several reasons for this, and I consider it to be more benefits than drawbacks. Ċ Nowadays, some people would like to have personal developing opportunities in their career but in some cases, in their native land, they can not seek out any chance for this because maybe their jobs or majors are not popular in their country. For example, in some countries, artificial intelligence is an aspect that is not enough common so that all the people who pay more attention to it can approach and find jobs. Hence, they have to move to other countries where they are enabled to study and work in this sector. Ċ In my view, this trend brings about many upsides rather than downsides. As I mentioned before, people who live and work abroad might find good jobs that are suitable for their interests and ability, so they might also be capable of earning a high salary and make their life better. On another side, it can be difficult for some people because they might feel out of water when living overseas alone, they also have to face many problems such as strange culture, communicative barrier. However, they can solve these things by learning the language and making more friends o improve their knowledge about the culture and inhabitants in this country. Ċ In conclusion, some individuals who go away from their home country result from the challenge of finding jobs in society, and I believe that this trend is desirable."
9661,Increasing travels between countries enable people to learn different cultures or to increase tension between people from different countries? broadening travelers' horizon and betterment of the local life,"In recent years, globalization has been promoted throughout the world, accelerating international tourism. Many adopt a view that the hostility between local citizens and foreign tourists because of their distinct culture and notion; however, the benefits of international travel can be overshadowed the disadvantages. Ċ Firstly, it is popular that the oversea tourists usually show their respect to local cultures, although they are sometimes conflicting, opposing to their lifestyle conception. In fact, many arrivers feel interested when they discover local cultures helping visitors leave their prejudices toward these customs. As an saying goes: ""When in Rome, do as Romans do"", this old saying indicates that tourists traveling to other countries should comply with their cultures and this is a stepping-stone encouraging foreigners to understand locals more clearly. For example, wearing niqab in Arab nations is a mandatory because of teachings of Koran but it is a strange thing in Western countries, as a result of this people can gain a mutual understanding when they travel to each nation. Ċ Secondly, another justification for international tourism is that it can open up more opportunities for business activities throughout the world. Anecdotal evidence shows that investors are able to expand their company to foreign countries and run it better when international travel is boosted, after that, businessman can take full advantages of their experience. Besides, foreign investment also benefit to residents which help them earning handsome incomes through providing service materials for tourists. In other words, this commerce may result in enhancing their life, respecting their customs and increasing the hospitality, thereby reducing the enmity each other. Ċ In conclusion, not only does international travel curb cultural perceptive differences but also broaden travelers' horizon and improve local life, notwithstanding the lack of comprehension of a few people in modern community."
9662,Many of the problems that people are experiencing in today’s world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today’s world majority of the population is battling with many issues. It cannot be denied that an inactive lifestyle is the origin of numerous health issues. From my perspective, static routine is not only the main reason but there are also several other factors contributing to these problems. I will detail them below. Ċ To begin with, no doubt that lack of physical exercise is the more prominent reason for a number of illnesses either physically or mentally. Rapid globalization and the growth of technology have made peoples’ life rather easy when compared to the olden days. Many of the chores either at the workplace or at home are carried out with the help of machines requiring very little bodily involvement. Moreover, most of the jobs are technically based requiring a smaller amount of physical movement and mostly requires a lot of sitting. For example, household tasks are carried out with the aid of home appliances which requires less putting hands on. Ċ On the other hand, there are many other factors that are causing a negative impact on humankind. Pollution is another cause of many diseases that are growing increasingly. Toxins released into the air is contaminating the environment and making the air impure to breathe and thereby causing respiratory diseases. Fertilizers and chemicals used in agriculture are poisoning the food items and consumption of such inorganic foods is also causing many health issues such as cancers and digestive problems. Drinking water available is also containing many pollutants in them and is therefore harming inhabitants on a large scale. Ċ To sum up, there are many other factors leading to the majority of problems mankind is facing in the modern world apart from an inactive lifestyle. In conclusion, people have to put their physical fitness and strength on top priority in any circumstances."
9663,"Some people feel that boarding schools (where students or pupils live at the school during the term) are an excellent option for children, while other people disagree for a number of reasons. Consider both sides of this debate and reach a conclusion.","It is believed by some that residential schools are a beneficial choice for children, whereas others consider this as a wrong statement. It would appear that both views have their positives and negatives. Ċ On the one hand, boarding schools have quite convenient offers for parents. In other words, if a child was sent to this kind of education places, parents are not obligated from day by day to look after their offspring, moreover, help with homework is also not on their chest anymore but on the nurses' and teachers' at that place. An example can be seen in Russia, where plenty of boarding schools exist and have higher popularity rather usual schools. In addition, children would acquire knowledge of how to be independent and make rational decisions. Ċ On the other hand, students with negative character might harmful impact on others. It is common knowledge that due to the naughtiness and waywardness of a child, his parents would send him to residential schools for the sake of the kid's character reformation. However, those children distract discipline, skip classes, and teach bad habits. For example, recent research shows that in America, owing to students with naughty character, in many boarding schools the number of wayward teenagers has grown. As a result, much power was used to prevent this chaos and establish strong discipline. Ċ In conclusion, some people take the view that residential schools have advantages, while their opponents reckon that there is nothing except disadvantages. Overall, it seems advisable that boarding schools have their benefits only if strict discipline implements."
9664,More and more people are moving to big cities these days. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of living in a large city.,"Issues related to living in a big city are frequently discussed these days. It is argued that nowadays, many people are leaving from suburban to urban areas. Despite the fact that this trend has some drawbacks, I would argue that there are more benefits. Ċ On the one hand, there are numerous merits associated with staying in big capital. The principal advantages are the opportunities of working and education. Generally, in the country villages have been solely elementary schools as well as a lack of great colleges whereas in town there are numberless colleges provided with the best teacher. For instance, in Bangkok, there are more than five universities offering faculty of applied art that is sufficient for pupils. Moreover, a young man who graduates from a great university can seek a job in a big company with a high salary. Ċ On the other hand, there are several demerits associated with living downtown. The main disadvantage is the unhealthy environment that results in health problems. Urban air contamination is a serious problem in many urban areas due to city traffic and uncontrolled factory emission. These problems have a negative impact on human health; such as allergic and stroke. For example, in Bangkok, people are addressing unhealthy smog because of uncontrolled toxic gases from cars which can result in heart disease. Ċ All things considered, it seems to me that the benefits of living in large cities slightly outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, individuals should decide their habitat by their own conditions while governments ought to develop efficient educational areas for all people in their countries."
9665,"Many people believe that university students should pay tuition fees in full themselves, because they gain education for their own benefit and not for the society?  To what extent do you agree or disagree ?","These days, education plays an vital role in every society. A country can be successfully developed by a number of talented students. While many people claimed that students must pay tuition fees for their own knowledege and experience obtaining during their study. I personally believe that this educational expense is entirely responsible of the gorvenment. Ċ First, it is true that education is crucial to the development of a country. When people today need to have a specific set of skills to survive in this competitive world as well as progress. This set of skills can be referred to as Education. Studying languages at school, for example, is far more popular as the globalisation is becoming increasingly interconnected , which demands an essential tool to communicate across culture develops. As a consequence, this may lead to the cultural exchange among nations being more easier. Ċ Second, from the perspective of financial budget, some families cannot afford the expense for their children to pursue further education. Therefore it is a good solution when authoritied instutitions and gorverment should mainly take this responsiblity by granting the tuition for free for the students. This may enable to them study more effective. Furthermore, once the student received tuition fees for free, they are highly likely to focus more on their study. Students come from low-incomed family, for example, they may work for a living such as paying house, electric bills, foods beside studying. As a result, due to studing hard, student can obtain good qualifications and acquire useful knowledge from the universities. Ċ In conclusion, I fully support the view that it is important to gorvenment take a duty towards students on paying fully tuition fees interms of the economic development, learner's budget and the qualifications of the students ."
9666,"In recent years, there has been a rise in the popularity of second-hand clothing amongst younger generations. Ċ Why is this happening? Ċ Do you think it’s a positive or negative development?","Reselling is the new trend. The generation of today prefers purchasing used goods, over new ones. There are many reasons behind this inclination and in my view, this is a good development as it reduces waste and helps people save money. This essay will discuss the main causes as well as the pros of buying used items. Ċ There are myriad reasons for shopping second hand items. Firstly, it is economical for the households. For example, a number of branded items can be bought at thrift stores at about half the prices or lower than that, which brings down the expenses. Additionally, used branded clothes or electronics tend to last longer, compared to cheap Unbranded items. To cite an example, a used Revlon dryer, will probably function for an extended amount of time, in comparison to the inferior quality hair dryer. This imparts the consumers the value for the dollars spent. Ċ Buying utilised things, is a favourable development, as it protects the environment. Due to tons of items being discarded regularly, increasing landfills are becoming a major concern for the nations. The issue can be addressed when citizens buy used merchandise, instead of letting it rot in the garbage. Furthermore, the pollution due to manufacturing can be decreased, as the demand for new items decrease. For instance, to produce a single cotton shirt, one pound of chemicals which release harmful contaminants in the surrounding, are needed. Hence, this contamination can be eliminated if more and more individuals choose to thrift clothing, accessories and electronics. Ċ Moreover, when used items are purchased, it benefits not only the customer, but also the seller. To illustrate it, alternatively, the unnecessary clutter, can be sold at affordable prices, which benefits the consumer and the owner can earn money from it too. Thus, it is a win-win situation for both the parties. Ċ To conclude, the awareness among human civilization about the necessity of reducing expenses as well as the upsides of using branded goods are the main causes of the trend. In my view, it is a very positive advancement, as it affects the planet positively, while financially helping out the common man."
9667,"Currently, anyone can post information on the internet. Therefore, most information on the internet might be inaccurate. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this information era, with the spread of internet,news is conveyed much easier than before. The majority of people consider the internet as a platform to express their thoughts. However, some people may concern about the accuracy of information on the internet.From my perspective, most of important news showed online is trust-worthing. Ċ The obvious reason is that although the internet is available for everyone, the main websites are required registration,which means everyone should be responsible for their behaviors.Otherwise,they will be punished by the government.For example, in 2003, there was a serious disease spreading in China,some people registered on the websites spread that the salt can ensure people against the disease,which lead to a large number of people choose to eat salt instead of seeing a doctor. Unfortunately, numerous people died due to this rumor.Of course, the rumor-makers are ended up in jails. Ċ Another reason to be mentioned is that a great deal of important information is published by professional institutions,such as the government and universities. For the sake of their reputation and authority, these institutions would definitely post accurate information on their websites to gain popularity and trust. Ċ Of course, that is not to say there is no inaccurate information on the internet. Some informal media coverage gossip about celebrities to the viewers. But such information is unimportant and most people just watch these news for entertainment.While if the media infringe on notables' rights,they will be penalized as well. Ċ In conclusion, although anyone can write news online, they have to enjoy the freedom on the premise of abiding the law and most of the important news comes from professional groups .Therefore, we can say that the most of information online is reliable."
9668,"It is argued that university student should study a full range of subjects, instead of some specific subjects? To what extend do you agree or disagree?","It is often argued that studying a variety of courses at the university is more beneficial than taking uniquely a few subjects . In my opinion, I completely disagree with this view and think that is specialized in some branch of knowledge can be the best way of education. Ċ Firstly, I take the view that pupils can make fundamental expertise in fewer disciplines and not in all of them. In other words , If undergraduates learn plenty of courses at the same time , they will find many difficulties to master the whole of these subjects because the competence of humans is limited and they cannot focus on various information in a short time. However, scholars who are specialized in just some fields can develop comfortably a deep and concentrated knowledge and therefore gain expertness. For example , I studied chemical process engineering at the university and I worked in the same field . Moreover , I have an objective to build a career in this discipline. Thus, this approach is worthier for scholars. Ċ Secondly , I believe that learners , who study the specialities interested for them, are more effective and efficient . To put it simply , juniors cannot be motivated in all branches ; consequently, they will not have good grades ; hence giving them the ability to choose the subjects that are useful to them can be more valuable and advantageous , because they will study what they want . For instance , students who are not passionate about physics can select other fields interesting for them . That's why specialism in some branches may be more crucial . Ċ In conclusion , I strongly believe that students , who are specialized in some branch of learning ,have the possibility to succeed in their studies because it gives them the ability to develop an expertise and study the discipline more interested for them."
9669,"Some people think that books should be stopped in school and that videos, films and computers should be used instead. To what extent do you agree?","The books are an essential part of the education system from last centuries, even though, technology brought up a plethora of lucrative stuff in every field, such as video, projectors, and online study board which is really helpful in terms of study, but still, we cannot replace the books with these things. In my opinion, I partially agree with the notion mentioned above that books should be replaced with videos and films. The essay will discuss both facets of a proposal with appropriate examples reaching a logical conclusion. Ċ To begin with, some argue that the multimedia should be used in the educational organizations instead of books because it will provide useful and up to date information to students that will an enormously crucial for their future. However, as compare to the computers, books has recapitulate knowledge about any topic, as books are written by one person, who may have limited information about the topic. For instance, when we are searching on the computer, about anything, and it shows us many choices but books have a few. Ċ Furthermore, people who are thinking that books should be banned from schools are wrong because books are, the less expensive resource of information about everything, and easily accessible from anywhere. On the other hand, videos and films need electric gadgets that are very costly for some students. If schools stop books, then it will be a significant hindrance for poor kids. Secondly, these types of sources relay on the internet and energy, that are sometimes not available due to any conditions, so that they will put atrocious effects on their progress. For example, in India, especially in summer season weather conditions usually severe that hits the power supply in some rural areas. Ċ In conclusion, I think that the books and technological devices are both primary indispensable for the student's literacy, and institutions should use computers to reflect the real world knowledge for students, but they should not stopped books as these are also pragmatic for an improvement."
9670,"Do you agree or disagree w/ the following statement. In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at young age.","Whether people should learn to manage their own money at young age in order to become financially responsible adults is widely discussed. Many people feel that it's not necessary to learn at young age. However, I strongly contend that people should acquire the financing knowledge at a young age for the following reasons. Ċ Among the numerous reasons supporting such a claim, the most critical one is that it can help children grow an appropriate financing behavior. That is to say, it can help them prevent from wasting money. Generally, children don't work, so their allowance sources are from their parents. If their parents give them too much money, they might be spoiled and form a bad spending habit. Thus, they could not make both ends meet when they grow up. Ċ In contrast, there is the viewpoint that children will learn how to finance their spending by life experience. To further elaborate, when they start to work, they will learn to manage their own money by themselves. Thus, parents don't have to teach their children how to deal with their allowance. However, according to research by various statistic reports, in Taiwan, the majority factors of parricide and rubbery are due to lack of money and most of the criminals have a bad spending behavior. Some of them are spoiled at a young age and others lack in learning to manage their own money when they are young. Ċ In sum, although there may be dissenting views, we can safely come to the conclusion that most young individuals ought to be taught about how to manage their own wealth at a young age. Otherwise, they might not become financially responsible adults and some criminal problems will still exist."
9671,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?,"It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study. Ċ In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child`s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child`s behaviors. Ċ Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child. Ċ Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn`t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly .Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly. Ċ In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors."
9672,Sending space crafts and astronauts into space is very expensive. It would be of greater value for the government to use the money spent on space exploration to improve the quality of life on Earth. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Space should be explored even though it is high cost; some opinion that the government would invest their money improving the quality of life across the globe instead of spending on outer space. I totally disagree that this exploration should be halted. Both reasons along with my perspectives linked to the topic will be outlined in the following paragraphs. Ċ There are a host of arguments in favour of investing money in space exploration. The most important factor is the encouragement of expanding the human species from the earth to others. There is a universal consensus that almost all people always have the concentration of their future lives. If they can no longer stay in this world, they are more likely to have more chances to not only travel but also live in other worlds. Consequently, they are going to have the motivation to make more money to have first-hand experience of outer space. For example, Jeff Bezo, former chief executive officer of Amazon, spend his rest entire time exploring it and going to the moon. Ċ Additionally, another foreseen cause is the development of technological advancement. Without a doubt, the government who spend money in the space industry always developed technology in materials, systems, and countless advanced things. Without this significant improvement, most countries frequently cannot move forward. It is undeniable that hardly any technological innovation could not be produced by the investment in high-tech industries. An outstanding example would be that the telephone network is created by investing in the military, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of mobile and internet later. Ċ To sum up, even though some people thought that spending on astronauts or crafts is a waste of resources, I am of the opinion that it will have more beneficial sides of emotional perspectives and innovations. Unless the government does not improve the quality of life on Earth, it is more likely that nations do not tend to have more innovative technology."
9673,Some people believe that individuals are born with leadership skills. Others say that these skills can be developed with experience. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"While some individuals are with the view that people inherit leadership capability, others think it can be achieved by effort. In my opinion, a human can accomplish mentorship competency by learning and on-hand jobs; however, both views will be discussed in the essay. Ċ On the one hand, by exercising and exploring knowledge anyone can be a leader. When a person learns or practices any task with supreme attention, he or she becomes skilful in that field. With the progress of time, that human specialized in that subject, and become competent enough to lead others. Thus, an individual can establish himself or herself as an expert by regular trying. For instance, there are many CEOs employed in renowned companies, who born in poor families where no one of their family members has mentorships, rather they develop themselves by their own attempts. Ċ Nevertheless, inborn talents drive leadership. It has been shown that many individuals have more innate abilities compared to others, such as expertise in persuade or effective communication capacities with the public. That means, they can excel general candidates in any work as they are privilege by their inherited skills. Hence, gradually they will guide others and become a mentor. Despite the fact, to grasp or hold the position permanently any competency requires to be practised otherwise that will obsolete by others. For example, many celebrities dropped out every year though they are talented because of not care about acting. Ċ In conclusion, although some individuals believe that human has supervisor ability naturally, others think experience and industry promote building valuable things in human. I agree with them who believes anything can be attained by regular practice."
9674,"Do you agree or disagree with the following sentence. It is important to know about the events happening in the world, even though it is unlikely to affect your daily life.","Making ourselves aware about current news in the world is the need of an hour. World is changing very fast. It is necessary to know about the events happening in the world. This helps us to find out what is good and what is bad for us. Knowing about current news helps us in many ways. Ċ Firstly, as a student, taking current news is the part of my study, because general knowledge is the common subject of many competitive exams, entrance exams, and interviews. We have to be familiar with all the events happening around us. It is not only help in our study, but also in our personal life. For example, technology has developed a lot and is developing day by day. Daily new advanced technologies are introduced by inventors. We must have knowledge about these new inventions. Computer and internet is the best invention of the century. Knowledge about these helps us in our day to day life. For example, if we want to buy a new laptop and we know which one is best and advanced then, we can decide quickly which one to buy. Ċ In addition, competition has increased a lot and is increasing day by day. It is necessary to get ourselves updated to stand in today's competitive world. Keeping knowledge about current news helps us to avoid mistakes. For example, Newspaper, Online news and TV news inform us about Global Warming. We can take care after knowing the dangerous effects of Global Warning. Like this, there are many other news which we can take from news and protect ourselves from dangers. Ċ Finally, it is not possible to take all news from all over the world in today's fast paced world, but we can take the important ones. No matter, that is going to effect on our life or not. We should take these for knowledge."
9675,Violence in the media promotes violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree? broadcasting violent content in tv,"Brutality shown on the TV instigates atrocity in community. This essay agrees with this view because it provokes response among young viewers and humans possess a propensity to follow what they see in movies. Ċ Young generations are easily motivated by ferocity displayed on the TV and other sorts of media. When they play online video games, they are instructed to fight opponents or even slay them to win the match. Such promotion invokes them to believe that brutality is acceptable, therefore, they apply in the real world to the real people. Seeing such activity, other young adults follow the same path of destruction and get involved with chaotic situations. Numerous studies done by Harvard University revealed the identical result that role-playing action games that are major sources of violence are accountable for 24% of the crimes performed by teenage and adult gamers. Ċ Human beings have a tendency to imitate what movies show them. They believe the media and the limelight to be their perfect idols and follow in their footsteps. As they see the media keeps showing violent stuff and their favorite celebrities are performing such roles, they hold a belief that such things are adaptable. As a consequence, they try to perform such roles in the real life and hurt other citizens, sometimes even worse, they kill them. To state an example, some fans of WWE reportedly found to apply some moves of their favorite stars and ended up breaking their bones. Ċ To conclude, this essay agrees that violent events in the media events begets more atrocity in society because they stimulate violence among young boys and girls, and humans, by nature, follow what they watch on the TV."
9676,"In today 's world, it is private companies rather than the government who pay for and carry out the scientific research.To what extend do you agree or disagree that the advantages overweight its disadvatages?","In the recent days, a more popular phenomenon was coming up with instead the private companies always pay more investment for the science rather than the government who should do this.To explore why this phenomenon would occurred, we need to considerate both rewarding issue and for what kind of role did the government or companies play. Ċ Obiviously, it is no doubt that the companies do that is because they can get a profitable rewarding as the result, which is the best incentive for reviving those companies. The companies, such as Google or Microsoft, have invested in reasearch increasingly as a big part of their cost. The kind of behaviour would not only guarantee its own immaculate productions but take a benefical occupancy in the various and competitive market. Ċ Moreover, we must admit that the government would be lost burden if the companies could take much of investment. It seems to be, not surprisingly, a win-win situation.In addition, the saved budgets for the government could be taken as to fill its financial deficit or invested in the other part of essential, for instance, the infrastucture, elementary education and so on. Ċ In another aspect, what the companies donate to the scientific research is not merely limited to money. It concludes other resources, like intellects, advanced management and well-equipped lab.All the efforts by the companies, in some sense, will be considered as an effective way to value its greatness. As we know, a successful enterprise is not only related to how much profits it made but also links that how many contributions and responsibilities it undertaken.After all, a notable company has profoundly affected to the whole society."
9677,"Many people think cheaper air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people to travel further. However, others think this leads to environmental problems, so air travel should be more expansive in order to discourage people to have it. Ċ Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","People have different views about whether people should be encouraged to travel more frequently through cheaper airfares or be dissuaded from travelling by the higher cost. While fewer flights will mitigate environmental destruction, I believe that cheap flights will benefit the masses. Ċ On the one hand, some people are strong advocates of raising airfare because it can help reduce the environmental impact of the airline industry.This means that higher prices will discourage the public from travelling great distances to other places. For example, the greenhouse gases produced by aeroplanes can decrease if the number of departures and returns drops. Furthermore, the other problems related to the aviation sector, including noise pollution and environmental destruction caused by the construction of airports and other facilities, will also be mitigated. Ċ On the other hand, it is perhaps more sensible to encourage the public to flight to all over the world through low-cost air tickets.Firstly, some youngsters are able to afford the cost of visiting other countries where they can find better jobs and study in their dream universities in order to get a higher quality of life.Secondly, some small business owners can discover business opportunities during their trips and earn benefits by exporting and importing products. In my opinion, they are likely to miss out on these opportunities if the cost of flights is higher. In addition, since the development of technology has been fast than ever before, it is a trend for the aviation industry to use clean energy as well as decrease ticket prices. Therefore, it is necessary to set the airfare at a reasonable price that everybody can afford it. Ċ To sum up, I think that it would be wrong to impose restrictions on air travel, and the cheaper airline tickets can benefit every member of our society. Air company can turn to technological innovations as part of the effort to reduce the strain on the environment."
9678,Some people think it is not necessary for adults to receive education in class. Self-study is a good way for them to study more effectively. To what extent do you agree or disagree with it?,"There are some ways for people to study their desired subjects. Some people think that self-study is the most effective one, but when it comes to me, I would like to prefer classroom education because of several reasons. Ċ First of all, in-classroom education, there are professional people who direct students in an effective way based on their academic experiences. For example, if one does not know what they should begin with, the professors or tutors would help them to find their way. On the other hand, they give useful feedback to undergraduates. For instance, while I am preparing for the IELTS exam, it is important for me to receive constructive opinions from professionals about my essays or the quality of speaking. Also, professionals are able to provide students with tips that they should take into account during the exam. Ċ Secondly, the academic environment makes a person be more responsible because there is a fixed program schedule and all pupils want to cover the whole material. This state creates competency among them. Every student will try to do their best to catch up with others. To illustrate, I had a partner during the IELTS class, and her speaking was more fluent than mine, so I wished to speak English like her and it made me more eager. Additionally, minors give money to complete the subject to get their highest point. Maybe, it can be also one of the reasons to act in charge of. Ċ In conclusion, education in the academic class is a more effective way for learners, because of professional guidance, discipline and academic environment."
9679,Famous people sometimes give their opinions on public topics. Is this a good thing? To what extend do you agree or disagree,"Whether people should follow the opinion of public figures, authors or bloggers on general topics is a subject of controversy. Many people often argued that, whereas in my notion, I completely agree that this is a positive cause and this essay will elucidate in depth. Ċ Firstly, who is famous other than authorities and powerful politics? Anyone who has followers in millions or billions becomes famous because the nation has provided value to their concerns and moves. There are various famous persons worldwide who are working for social welfare and spreading positivity among nations, by giving street talks and extended campaigns on general public matters either it is for students, youth or professionals. To illustrate this, a year ago Young Pharmacist Association came into existence with the collaboration of famous health blogger, for additional seats in government sectors by stopping degree rentals thus, authorities were forced to act against the pharmaceutical owners. That not only opened doors for unemployed degree holders but also economy led. Ċ Secondly, it has tremendous benefits and a good step for community and societies who cannot approach to higher authorities for certain matters. Nonetheless, their concerns towards the public are unaccountable with shocking positive outcomes. To add more, an Arabic figure, who started working on family disputes around the city, saved many broken families. Furthermore, their enormous speeches and messages on various topics, such as; health awareness, education and vocational courses for impoverished families. Therefore, their suggestions have had been flourishing many lives around us. Ċ In conclusion, I reckon that bits of advice being delivered by famous people on common subjects always have concrete reasons to act upon, thus, beneficial for the nation."
9680,"Some people say that parents have more important roles to play in children development.However, others argue that friends and television have the most significant influence. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In the realm of children improvement,some people believe that guardians have the main effect on them,whereas the opponents have alleged that Tv and their friends are more powerful to influence them.However,in my point of view,they both are indispensable in forming the personality of the learners.mentioned sides are uttered here. Ċ One of the most highlighted discrepancies between parents and others has to do with their positions in the mind of their offspring,while they are usually looked up to as the heroes of their next generation,Therefore,they are pursued by toddlers as roleodes.For instance,based on the surveys that have taken place in this area,the majority of juveniles are similar to their parents in various sectors,such as either their character or even the same capabilities to encountering the issues.Furthermore,the bold roles of the elderly emerge in the situations that the young requires to be conducted via consultation or more harsh reactions.As a vivid case,the older not only are aware of the threats for the juveniles owing to the experiences that they used to have but also they have a better prospect of the conditions that appear while they are monitoring the activity of their adolescents,which can be exploited to control them in hazardous circumstances.In other words,they can assist their heir to opt for appropriate programs or even friends. Ċ On the other hand,owing to the close understanding that individuals have if they are in the same age,it is clear that babies are attracted to people in their age,hence they will learn a lot of things from them by mimicking their function,which has been released by the experts.For example,in the conditions that there are divergent toys,most of the unadult folks are absorbed in the ones that their patrons are using and even if they change their mind regarding the utilisation of objects again the followers would strive to get the new one.Moreover,the broadcasted cartoons from Tv have the potential to penetrate their audiences as an offspring of the professional mindsets that have been exploited to build that.Namely,using scion to play opted roles in movies or even looking at the globe from the prospect that their followers can perceive,which stimulate the youngster to trust in and accept the issues that have been transmitted to them. Ċ To recapitulate,although some individuals have claimed that friends and Tv have a stronger impression on children due to the appealing energy that they have,the rest mentioned their guardians as the main manager,who can control the activity of their offspring.Anyway,to me they both have their share in the life of the young,so,a mixture of them should be considered to guide the juvenile toward the appropriate goals."
9681,Are zoos inhumane? Prompt: Some people think that zoos are all cruel and should be closed down . Others however believe that zoos can be useful in protecting wild animals.  Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.,"Nowadays almost every city has a zoo, keeping and displaying various wild animals. However, there is a dispute on whether zoos are cruel or not. I will examine both sides and then give my own opinion. Ċ Some argue zoos are cruel, largely because they believe animals may suffer from living in zoos, where wild animals are caged These creatures do not have enough space to move around and are separated from their family and friends. Zoos are especially cruel for animals that are born in the wild but forced out of their natural habitat. For them, the new environment in zoos could be hard to adjust to. Depression and physical problems may therefore emerge and damage the life quality of wild animals. In some cases, keepers mistreating animals adds to the cruelty of zoos. For example, animals may suffer from not having enough food and water. Ċ There are two main reasons why some people believe zoos can good for wild animal protection. First, zoos protect endangered species by offering them much-needed shelter. Having lost their natural habitat, some animals have to rely on zoos for space and food. In this sense, zoos are vital for them to survive and multiply. If all zoos were closed down, these creatures, with no natural habitats left, would have nowhere to seek refuge. Second, zoos raise people's awareness of wildlife protection. Zoos enable people to get close to wild animals and to know how they live. In this way, visitors would develop an affection for wild creatures. Ċ As far as I am concerned, zoos, with their facilities and expertise in keeping animals, could be helpful in protecting endangered species from extinction."
9682,Everyone should be encouraged to use fewer resources rather than recycle more. To what extent do you agree with this statement?,"Recently, there have been many arguments on whether we, people, should consume fewer natural resources or be encouraged to recycle more to maintain the green ecosystem as well as to fulfil the demand of the general public. I partially agree with the above statement and in this essay, I will explain why I do not completely approve that we should be fortified to use less environmental reserves. Ċ To begin with, there is enough evidence to support the idea that it is a must for everyone to consume less raw materials as this will maintain biodiversity and increase the chances of our future generation survival. Saving energy, especially electricity, could help us to utilise more appropriatelyReplace the wordappropriateThe word appropriately doesn’t seem to fit this context. Consider replacing it with a different one. Ċ show examples for other areas where it should be used wisely. For instance, in developing countries, such as Pakistan, many villages are living in darkness because of the lack of electricity. Even though they are willing to pay for service, unfortunately, the demand cannot be fulfilled because of the overconsumption of lights in urban areas. Consequently, people have to live without heat and light due to the improper management of energy resources. Ċ However, it is also undeniable that recycling more can help us sustain the emerald environment. It is observed that most of the waste materials from industries, vehicles and daily use for various purposes end up in the ocean. All around the world, it is common that seashores are filled with plastic garbage which has been increasingly used in every part of the world and needs to be reduced, reused and recycled as it is destroying our natural habitats and exterminating organisms. Therefore, it is our duty to participate actively in recycling activities and make every effort to reduce pollution as much as possible. Ċ 	To conclude, in maintaining biodiversity for future generations, it is important that not only should we reduce the use of natural resources, but we should recycle more often for the materials that we use or have used."
9683,"In some countries, schools are open till late so that children can be looked after when parents are at work. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.","In several nations, educational institutes remain available during the evenings to take care of pupils while their legal guardians are still occupied. Although numerous conveniences for this trend exist, other adverse still worth considering. Ċ On the one hand, one key advantage for keeping a child in school until the end of working hours is enhancing the financial situation of a person. In other words, various employees mainly women are not obligated to conduct a part-time job which is generally low paid, because they are supposed to take their dependants from the classroom. Moreover, being occupied by multiple tasks denies certain workers to be creative and productive inside their firms. To demonstrate, my sister who is a teacher, was able to teach more courses when my mother decided to raise the children in her absence. Hence, the economic status of personnel will be positively impacted by leaving youngsters inside classrooms after teaching time Ċ On the other hand, the mental health of young individuals is negatively impacted by the late work of their parents. This means numerous scholars are victims of bullying inside classes because they are treated as orphans due to the significant absence of their dads or moms. Furthermore, students are obligated to wait long hours until reaching home which is considered a crucial comfort zone far from daily learning pressure. As reported in a study conducted by Harvard University in 2012, juveniles that were being left outside their houses for excessive periods faced many learning disabilities which will affect their future performance in the community. Ċ To conclude, in various countries, an array of adults are leaving their dependants at school while they are still working. However myriad pros for this topic are involved such as improving personal income, other factors that affect sceptically the moral wellness of a child."
9684,The purpose of libraries is to provide books.They should not use limited resources and space to provide CDs or DVDs.To what extent do you agree?,"In the present age, libraries are playing significant roles in our lifes,and most of them provide CDs or DVDs,which has aroused an intense debate among people.In this essay, Ċ I am going to discuss the pros and cons of this issue. Ċ Personally,I totally disagree with this perspective.To start with,CDs or DVDs will not occupy too much space,most of time they will be placed in a corner.Moreover,when people get tired,they can skim some CDs or DVDs,which I believe will make them relaxed.For some people,the supply of CDs or DVDs provides conveniences to them when they want to buy some stuffs by coincidence.Obviously,a large amount of knowledge can be stored in discs where people can get information.It is no doubt that the main purpose of libraries is to provide information,and CDs or DVDs is just another valid approach.We can see more vivid images,hence,we can absorb knowledge in an easier and funnier way.Therefore,with the development of technology,CDs and DVDs in the library are kinds of positive results. Ċ However,I admit that most space in the libraries should place books,which are important to people's lifes.But that does not mean CDs or DVDs should not be provided.They can store much more information with less size,so many people would like to choose this way. Ċ In conclution,products like these promote the variety of libraries.They bring people a modern and convenient approach.That will not conflict the exist of books,and they will be accepted by more people.According to the essay,advantages of providing CDs or DVDs in libraries outweigh the disadvantages obviously."
9685,"Question:  The advantages brought by the spread of English as a ""global language"" will outweigh the disadvantages. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this view?","It is no doubt true that English language has already played a dominant role in the world. Some people argue that this social phenomenon is not a good trend while others hold an opposite idea. This essay will discuss both of these two opinions. Ċ On the one hand, English language is essential in our daily life in terms of work, study, and life. Many international corporations choose English as their business language during numerous commercial conferences; a lot of prestigious universities select English as their main teaching language; English boards and signs can be found everywhere in a big city. People use English to transfer their ideas and feelings, to achieve business targets, and to gain more teaching resources. Needless to say, English is very important, and users should give priority to learn this language. Ċ On the other hand, it may also be harmful to the cultural diversity. There are millions of countries with diverse languages. If citizens all over the world used the same language, they might lose their valuable cultural heritage. For example, many American Indian languages have permanently vanished after cultural assimilation because stronger and bigger language has a huge impact on smaller countries. This could definitely be a huge loss to all human beings. Ċ In conclusion, by introducing English language, people can be provided with the opportunities to talk to and learn from each other; however, people should also take action to preserve or revive their mother tongue."
9686,"In order to improve a country's education system, young students should be allowed to openly criticize their teachers during class time. What is your opinion? What are some other ways education systems could be improved?","Arguments over how to best improve education systems have been going on since the practice of teaching began. The idea that young students should be allowed to openly criticize their teachers in an effort to better an education system is considered preposterous and I agree. The alternatives of altered school scheduling and teacher monitoring through video will be analysed for viability. Ċ Firstly, modified school scheduling would promote educational benefits in a way that openly criticizing could not. For example, many Scandinavian schools run education systems that take three-week breaks throughout the academic year instead of an extended two-month break at summertime. Overall, students have just as much holiday time as their peers in traditional schooling arrangements, but there is not such a long, learning-deterring break of summer, and this allows students to mentally retain more of their studies. This example is clearly a more plausible alternative to the argument that students should be allowed to criticize their teachers. Ċ In addition to this, schools should consider video taping classes to both monitor teacher performance and student conduct. For instance, I once taught some students using this arrangement and this made it easy for the students' parents to stay attuned to both their children's lessons and conduct during class time. This sort of educational adjustment would do more for improving a child's schooling than open student criticism of instructors. Thus, the plausibility of this alternative is clear. Ċ In conclusion, both scheduling and class transparency would be more positive alterations to the current study system than a system of public ridicule. It is therefore hoped that these changes gain support in the foreseeable future."
9687,Some countries have introduced a law to limit working hours for employees. Why is this law introduced? Do you think it is a positive or a negative development?,"Some countries have passed a restriction to legitimize the number of hours that employees spend at work. This law is established due to the health deterioration of the people of working age, and in my view, this is a positive movement. Ċ Firstly, there are several warnings about the degradation of the working-age population's health condition in recent years. Due to working overtime, employees lack opportunities to do exercise and do outdoor activities, which is crucial to keep fit and have a balanced state of mind. The long hours of sitting concentratedly in front of the screen are causing chronic backaches and eye strains among people in the age of 25 to 40, especially and severely manifested in the white-collar community. Therefore, governments have to limit the business hours by enforcement to let individuals maintain their well-being. Ċ Secondly, I think this change is beneficial to not only the workforce but also their family and society as a whole. Having a chance to take care of themselves can boost the productivity of the workers significantly, as well as prolong their available work span in the long run. As a result, they are capable to work for a longer time and are less dependent on government welfare support in their later years. In addition to this, they can spend more quality time with their children, which is extremely vital to strengthen family bonds. Children always need the care of their parents, so the hours spent with them should not be at the expense of their parent's extended responsibility at work. Ċ In conclusion, imposing restraint on how much time people can spend at the office brings about benefits in many respects. It is because employees need to have a work-life balance to preserve their physical state and enhance other aspects of their life."
9688,Some people said that school should focus more on teaching practical subjects such as car maintenence or managing the bank account. To what extend do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"School has increasingly introduced more practical classes which are focused on teaching skills such as car repairs and financial management. There is an argue whether education's attentions are these subjects or traditional ones are maths and science. It is my point of view that both practical subjects and academic subjects are equally helpful for life basis and occupational purposes. Ċ To begin with, it is important to target at academic subjects such as science or history as providing the compulsory fundamental knowledge demanded for professional careers. By having deeply understanding about scientific subjects, students can easily get their diplomas that allow them to get better studies. Imagine a doctor without a good understanding of biology or an architect who can't stand calculation unit. Ċ Besides the beneficial of these traditional classes, we can not bypass the necessary of practical courses. With the knowing widely about managing a bank account or car adjustment, we are equipped them the essential tools for their forthcoming growth. By using time spent on soft skills classes, they are likely to form valuable experiences through tasks performances and save their time in the future. At school, our education system include lots of practical courses such as financial management or fixing the car and I have become aware more of being mindful and careful. In this way, I have regarded a scholarship about being a multi-tasking student at school. Ċ In conclusion, the balance between traditional classes and practical courses are required in the responsible educational purposes. Therefore I am in complete agreement that schools should equally provide the academic subjects and practical ones as it helps pupils both in the daily lives and authority knowledge."
9689,Illiteracy has traditionally been viewed as largely a Third World problem. It is seen as having a effect on a country's development.  Discuss some of the causes of this problem and suggest the best ways to overcome it,"It is true that the illiteracy rates, in some countries, have been on the increase and been viewed as a Third World problem. This issue must be alleviated because it is global and many people are suffering. Ċ There are many reasons for illiteracy. First of all, the high level of poverty is the main cause of the problem. Most poor families are unable to afford educational fees for their off-springs; therefore, these children skip schools and start working at early ages. For example, many young people see labor jobs simply as a means of earning money, and they are happy if they are able to cover their own living expense and support their family. Another factor is poor educational systems. Most education institutions in developing countries are not designed to cope with huge volume of students, due to poor infrastructure and a lack of staff members. Ċ There are some measures available for educational authorities to consider when dealing with this problem. Firstly, public funds could be invested into regenerating the schools' infrastructure. Constructing new modern buildings and training more teachers would reduce some of the problem. Another solution to solve the issue is to provide free or low-cost education until tertiary levels. This will either encourage young people to go to public schools, or guarantee the efficient number of well-educated citizens. Ċ In conclusion, poverty and poor education system are two factors contributing to illiteracy rates. To deal with this problem, investment in school infrastructure and the introduction of free education are two viable solutions."
9690,"Many people think that every individual is responsible for their happiness, but some people believe there are Ċ other external factors that influence us. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Everyone cherishes a happy life be whether it is based on internal or external factors. There is a category of people who believe that people are responsible for their happiness personally, but there are also supporters of the theory that only through external forces and circumstances can a person achieve happiness. In my opinion, a person’s happiness will always be according to his actions rather than throwing it on all other external factors. Ċ To begin with, many individuals believe that reaching blessedness is impossible without satisfaction. In this reason, in many cases, people’s fortunate depends on many external factors, such as religion, astrology or absence of economic hardship in the country. That is to say, citizens of wealthy countries can reach happiness, because they can realize their potential. A good illustration of this is Scandinavian countries. According to the World Happiness Report in 2018, the most happiest individuals on the planet live in this region. Ċ On the other hand, many believe that every individual, himself, is responsible for bringing joy to his own life. It seems logical that a person who is in the pursuit of happiness will probably keep finding the little moments to stay happy in comparison to the one who always need a big reason to make himself delighted. In other words, people, who enjoy and celebrate every bit of their lives, tend to remain more joyful. In contrast, a person, who requires a big reason or achievement to celebrate, seldom gets these chances in his life. Thus, it is perhaps needless to say that a man himself is responsible for bringing jubilation in his life. Ċ To conclude, people may vary in their opinion, but I strongly consider that enjoyment is more a result of the individual's efforts than simply a combination of circumstances. And every individual is responsible to feel satisfied with their own choices and decisions of life. Although, other objects can be reason of temporary optimism. However, if someone's not happy with themselves no other thing can keep them happy for a long period."
9691,Many school children today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school is this a positive or a negative development,"It has been a popular trend now to put children into what can be called as hands-on sessions. Some people criticise this practice whereas others support it. In this essay, first I will try to argue about both the positives and the negatives of this issue on kids and second I will put forward a rationale behind why this program is actually a positive for children. Ċ To begin with, one of the primary criticisms of work during school hours is that it eats up study time. This is true especially when the performance and peer pressure is increasing on students. For example, to get into decent college pupils must compete in a rat-race as a number of vacancies in such institutes are less. Furthermore,It is also a common notion that they should be provided with every bit of help to maximise their potential to excel in the curriculum. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a significant amount of time. As the minor won't really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would be hence better for them to remain at the academy. Ċ However, an Important gain which these hands-on session brought has more weightage than just letting them continue with their normal subjects. For instance, practical exposure to a technicality of complex subjects develops their problem-solving skills. So taking a child's whole experience of school into account, taking a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the week's task placement is done correctly, the task can also be served as a ""holiday"" away from faculty. In addition, these practicals will prepare them in advance for their future lives. They can see it is nothing to be scared about. By allowing children to work in temporary sessions, they will get an idea about which career would be suitable for them in future. Ċ To conclude, I feel that trial placements can be seen as a positive development. Missing short span of the academy is not a serious issue & the benefits that can be gained from the sessions are significant."
9692,"Topic:  According to an international travel magazine, many tourists today fly straight to their holiday resort and almost never leave it. Unlike tourists in the 1960 and 70's, they return home with no experience of the local culture. Why do you think this happens? How was tourism different in the past? Give reason for you answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience.","After hard work, everyone  hope have a tourist to relax and rest. As well as, their vacation is a inspiration to create for their new project and next  work. The same about  finally aims but there are many different between tourist past and today. Demand of people and develop tourism is a part of this change. Ċ In the past, most of tourists like discovering and freedom. So they found to their destinationby their motorbike or car. Then went to seesight, discovered this local. Sometime, they stay at home of local people instead of hotel. This thing can decrease cost for their tourist. Ċ Nowaday, flights and tranferstake people direct to their luxury hotel, where they stay for the rest of their holiday. Their hotel have good service, well facilities. Therefore, they felt very comfortable and convenient. Even though this place  have restarant, beach beautiful, playground to entertiment. This are factors everyone don't like leave it. If there have, they leave a little time, then they immetately return. Ċ This is a different between tourist past and today. Past tourist, after finish their vacation they have many colorful stories that they could tell. Otherwise today, they return home no experience of the local people. Ċ In the past or today, tourist have convenient or interest. In my view, past tourist still call packbackers. It is very interested. Because they have opportunite told with local people, expand knowleage, especialy try food which  never have at restaurant, know the local culture."
9693,Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?,"The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end. Ċ To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy. Ċ As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training, therefore save the time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation. Ċ To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say."
9694,"Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","People have different views about how to reduce the number of road traffic accidents to keep the road travel more safer. I believe both penalising the drivers and other effective measures would help to improve road safety. Ċ On the one hand, It is true that stricter punishments to drivers could help greatly to decrease the traffic accidents. There are many types of penalties such as increasing the amount of fine, driving license suspension or revocation and even imprisonment. The purpose of these legal consequences is to create a sense of fear and responsibility among drivers so that they drive their vehicles more carefully. Driving under the influence of alcohol, for instance, lead to license suspension of the driver in many countries. This has decreased significantly the drunk driving related driving incidents. We would hope that higher fine fees and legal consequences would reduce the driving related accidents. Ċ On the other hand, there are many other ways which can be implemented to improved road safety. Firstly, It is very important to educate our new drivers in the form of compulsory attendance at safe driving related courses and by making the driving book easier to understand for general public. Secondly, by installing more speed cameras at various random points of the roads would force the drivers to drive at the posted speed as over speeding is one of the major factors which contribute to road accidents. Finally, government should invest heavily in public transport, for example, adding more bus and train routes. and also keeping these vehicles in good maintained condition. This would attract commuters to use public transport instead of their cars which would result in reduce traffic congestion and less traffic accidents. Ċ In Conclusion, while harsh punishments would deter drivers to drive unresponsibly, I also strongly advocate the implementation of other methods to improve road safety."
9695,Topic：Nowadays，people live in the society where consumer goods are cheaper to buy. Do you think its advantages outweigh disadvantages?,"As a result of the widespread use of the machine and the development of modern technology, goods have become increasingly cheaper ,causing consuming more. For one thing, this trend has improve the material standard of living. For another, plenty of resources have been consumed and environment has been polluted due to the rise in comsuption. In my opinion, this trend has brought advantages and disadvantages. Ċ Thanks to the progress in modern technology and breakthroughs in industry, a large number of goods are affordable for people, from digital products to beautiful clothes, which makes people live a wonderful life. For example, cell phones, which only the rich could afford in the early 1990s, began to be prevelant among the public ten years later due to the progress in manufacture. This small digital communication tool enable people to reach others easily. There is a large amount of evidence to confirm that the public benefit so much from increasing cheaper goods (e.g., automobiles, computers, TVs, etc.). Ċ However, people tend to consuming too much goods has also caused many problems. Firstly, this trend has created severe environmental problems. For instance, in order to meet the endless requirements of customers, companies tend to enlarge production by building more factories. Consequently, these new factories erode thousands of acres of forest which is the habitats of numerous animals including those endangered. In addition, energy crisis become worse. Recently, most of machines are driven by fossil resources like coal and oil, which are non-renewable resources. Therefore, people should buy what they really need and should not waste them. Ċ To conclude, goods becoming cheaper better people's life while this trend has also caused some problems such as the destruction of ecosystem and energy crisis. When shopping, customers should consume in moderation."
9696,Some people prefer to spend time with their own age group while others like to spend their time with different age groups. Discuss both views and gibe your opinion.,"Time is the only thing which cannot be regained if lost.Hence, it is important that we spend it carefully.In this context, a few individuals always like to give their time to their contemporaries whereas some want to spend it with the ones who are elder or younger to them. In the current essay, I would discuss both views and give my opinion. Ċ On one hand, even though ,the concept of allocating our space to someone is purely individual,some people always try to be in close with the people they meet daily who are of their age .This may be due to many reasons.Firstly, it makes them feel that being with their contemporaries is the best way to get notified of new opportunities.As a result ,they can knock them faster. For example, young ones will only get updated with competitive exam notifications and job opportunities if they stay connected with their classmates who are into that. Ċ On the other hand, a few individuals prefer to lead their life in their own way by spending their time with elders like parents mainly because they feel de-stressed by observing these people who are out of the hustle and bustle of modern life.In addition , input given by older people will definitely improve one's living. For instance, as the elders have had crossed all the important junctions of life, their opinion on many things will guide us to a better solution. Moreover, spending with younger ones will refresh our mood.Thus we will have a fresh start. Ċ To conclude, I think we need to dedicate some space for contemporaries to move on in future and should try to be close to elders for their guidance.Last but not the least, we should give a piece of time for kids to enjoy their innocence."
9697,"Some educationalists argue that non-exam, arts-based subjects, such as music, drama, art and craft, should be compulsory in the secondary curriculum. They believe that activities such as these can improve overall academic performance. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Scientists have been arguing for a long time to improve the standards of the educational system. Although some believe that the government must have mandatory to define syllabus of the schools, others consider optional subjects should be a part of the system. Ċ The main idea of the intervention on the teaching system is contributing to students for purpose of improving skills. Because scientific researches indicate some courses help pupils to improve abilities. Significantly, the influence of arts-based subjects can see on numerous proficiencies such as sportive activities, and science. For instance, painting helps to concentrate, playing musical instruments co-operate to control emotions, and theatre contributes to improving thinking in situations. In this context, authorities intervene curriculum in order to gain success. Ċ However, many problems have existed as a consequence of committing regulations. To begin with, dependency on decisions may cause emotions, and the teaching process may not be sufficient. Moreover, the subjects might not be able to define on basis of talents. For example, the students have different skills; therefore, designing curriculums must be associated with the abilities. Further, mandatory may lead to public conflicts. To illustrate, families may be against some subjects to teach their children. Ċ I consider art-based subjects have the capability to improve talents because I witnessed myriad examples. Particularly, when I listen or read stories of sportsmen, sportswomen, scientists, and artists I found common thoughts are not only scientific subjects but also art-based subjects helped them to gain success. Nevertheless, I have doubts about mandatory. In fact, I believe subjects must be part of the educational system, but they should be optional. Ċ In conclusion, İf societies desire to grow well-educated and successful generations, they must design scientific and art-based curriculums in the system."
9698,"Some people think that lawbreakers should be sent to prison. However, others think that better talents among those should be made to work. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is heated controversy about whether the prisoner with better talents should be made to work. From my perspective, lawbreakers must be sentenced to jail, although some of them are talented in certain aspects of their works. Ċ To begin with, sentencing the lawbreakers to prison, only in this way, can ensure that the sufferer's rights not be violated again. Moreover, for espionage crimes, isolating them from the outside can keep the nation in a safer situation. The criminals should receive adequate punishment and realize their faults of committing a crime before being released to society. Otherwise, those wrongdoers with a criminal record could commit another crime habitually. Particularly, talented crimes can upgrade the modus operandi that increases the difficulty of catching them. Ċ Nevertheless, criminals with professional talents can be granted a specific work under imprisonment. They deserve penalties because of their misbehaviours and crimes despite their talents. However, it is reasonable to allow reformed criminals to contribute to society with their expertise and skills. For instance, the police can employ reformed frauds to assist them in detecting fraud cases with their experience. Another example, reformed hackers can work for corporations to protect technology intelligence from being stolen by competitors. In addition, they can work for the military to defend national hacking activities. In case these talented expirees are virtuous, they should be couraged to work and make good use of their profession. Ċ In conclusion, criminals should be under imprisonment because they deserve it. If someone with gifted expertise could leave the jail, it is unequal to other prisoners and unfair to the sufferers. Consequently, lawbreakers with professions also need to be sentenced to prison as others."
9699,"Some people feel that certain workers like nurses, doctors and teachers are undervalued and should be paid more, especially when other people like film actors or company bosses are paid huge sums of money that are out of proportion to the importance of the work that they do.  -How far do you agree? -What criteria should be used to decide how much people are paid?","As society evolves, people become more concerned with social issues. The distribution of the wealth among the high, middle and lower classes is a constant cause of disagreement between political parties and different social groups. Ċ Objectively speaking, the fairest way to decide how much someone should be paid for a certain job would depend on the level of skill and knowledge involved and how relevant it is to society's prosperity. Ċ However, this would only be applicable to a utopian society. Economy is not based on fairness, but on money flow. Each profession's wage is determined by how much money circulates in that area of work. A teacher cannot expect to be paid more than a film feature actor, even though their work is unarguably of more importance to society. The wage of a teacher is accumulated through tax payer's money. An actor's on the other hand is determined by the amount of people that pay voluntarily to go and watch a film in which they participate. Ċ I do agree with the idea that such vital contributors to our society such as educators and health care providers should be more valuable to society than corporation owners and football players, thus we should strive for a fairer distribution of wealth. Nevertheless, people should keep in mind that fairness is not always possible. Moreover, in many cases we actively contribute to social differences by refusing to pay higher taxes and choosing to spend money on products, services and ways of entertainment that we are not exactly necessary to us, whereas education and health care, for example, are vital."
9700,"In the future, the main reason for going to shopping mall will be for entertainment, not to shop. do you agree or disagree?","Some people are of the opinion that in time to come, individuals will mainly patronize the supermarkets just for fun activities rather than for shopping which I completely agree with. This essay will discuss various reasons for such a change in priority followed by a reasoned conclusion thereafter. Ċ To begin with, a lot of modern shopping malls are now being structured to capture all members of the family and society. As a result, there are different segments in the place to attend to individual needs including those seeking entertainment. For instance, shopping malls in addition to groceries have movie theatres, restaurants and even children's playgrounds encouraging household members with different needs to explore the environment maximally. Ċ Moreover, due to the rise in the standard of living, a lot of people especially teenagers and youths now shop for fun rather than for things they actually want. Accordingly, the trend is expected to rise in the nearest future as more countries continue to conquer hunger and improve the lives of their citizens. For example, statistics have shown that the dollar wastage of each family on a commodity bought and never used for its intended purpose has increased two-fold in the last decade with most customers agreeing to have it because of the extra cash at their disposal. Therefore, with better living conditions nearby, spending will rise further. Ċ In conclusion, the increasing pattern in seeking for entertainment rather than buying of goods in a supermarket is due to the modern architectural designs which encourage a wholistic service as well as better living conditions of citizens. The trend will go higher in time to come as more countries continue to grow and develop."
9701,In many countries in the world people buy clothes and choose hair styles according to the latest fashion. Why is this happening? Is this a positive or a negative development?,"To date, in most countries, people would choose their attire and hairdos based on the current trends. These changes have had a huge impact on our lives. Yet it has both pros and cons. The following paragraphs will discuss the key factors of this scenario as well as the consequences. Ċ To commence with, it can not be denied that the fashion updation has been in human's life for ages. Even I would say that homosapians had changed their clothes from leaves to animal's skin mere result of fashion curiosity. Since then, humans have always been in changing mode of dressing sense and hairstyles. Nevertheless, I wonder how this tendency had a smash sensation around the world at the same time? Perhaps there are two main reasons to substantiate this statement. Firstly, good clothing and trendy hairstyles have been a symbol of affluence. For example, on ,occasions people always end up spending too much money on designer's boutiques. Ċ Secondly, due to mass business and frequent advertisements teens would buy unwanted things then they will deem that as super cool. To add further, if any other kids, in their community, wear less attractive dress might be considered abnormal, not to mention there is a high chance to get bullied by others. Undoubtedly, the fashion industry has become a well-paid area, though on the other hand, to earn money they are exploiting other labour. For instance, brand companies like Gucci,Michal Kors and Guess made their customers mindset like expensive one is quality one which is most of the time not true. Ċ To conclude, from my point of view that up-to-date trendy and being tidy is essential for a better appearance, although it must not be a waste of money. Because this inclination might give psychological disturbance to underprivileged people."
9702,"Many parents complain about violence promoted to their children through video games, TV programs and other media. Why is it happening? What can be the solution for it?","Promoting violence and other adverse action for children has become increasingly popular nowadays. Many parents blame online games, TV show and other media that their children consume as a significant effect on the introduction of harmful actions. This essay will discuss the causes of this particular issue as well as possible solutions that can be taken to tackle the problem. Ċ To begin with, there are various causes associated with the introduction of violence to the younger generation. Unsuitable contain that children consumed have become the primary factor in this issue. In fact, it is super easy to get upper age contented on the internet through pop-up ads. A further cause is less supervision and education by parents about the negative content result, children have full approach of all information and idea that are provided in the internet or other media. For instance, children can play video games that contain adverse action, and also they get the full entry to porn and other adult fulfilled. Ċ However, there are several solutions to measure the problem. Firstly, parents ought to educate their youngster about those things before they know it by themselves. Indeed, if they already knew the harmful effects of those activities, they will have a filter in their brain to deny all harmful content. Secondly, parents must give restricted access to media which might deliver inappropriate ideas. In terms of prohibiting the harmful content, parents can install software that able to block such things to ensure that their children safe while using it. Ċ To conclude, promoted violence to the young generation is much easier than in the past due to several causes like entire approach to unsuitable fulfilled and less knowledge about those things, nevertheless, there are measures that can be taken to alleviate the problem."
9703,Many high street shops have gone out of business in recent years. why do you think this has happened? Is it a positive or negative development?,"Shopping online is developing in technology's world and it is a reason make traditional stores have disappeared in recent years. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons and positive or negative for development. Ċ On the one hand, there are many reasons why high street shops are disappearing. Firstly, online shopping is faster, cheaper and more convenient than traditional brick-and-mortar stores. For example, people can sit at home with a smartphone or a computer connect with the internet. They can search on the website to purchase products which they want to buy with the lower price than traditional stores. After that, they can receive items within 2 or 3 days. Additionally, products which you can not find in your local, you can buy it online without to find other traditional stores. Secondly, shopping online has many choices for customer to choose the product they need with high quality. Ċ On the other hand, shopping online development brings many benefits and drawbacks. The most important thing about shopping online is saving time. For example, shopping online is a solution for busy people as those who can not leave their house. Besides, a world of choice help people have many choices and buy items suitable for their styles and characters. However, shopping online uses the system to run programs on the website, so stores do not need over employments when they use the website to sell products. Therefore, shopping online is rising unemployment and loss of community as high streets become deserted. Ċ In conclusion, shopping online brings many benefits and it is a cause to make traditional stores meet difficulties. For traditional brick-and-mortar stores, they can connect with shopping online to can sell their products better."
9704,"QUESTION: Nowadays a growing throw-away culture causes people to throw away their goods and replace them with new, latest technology ones available on the market. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this culture for our society. ANSWER:","Due to rapid technology revolution many latest technology equipments products are delivered in the market. This motivates people to buy new equipments and throw away their old ones or replace old with new one. Let us see briefly about both merits and demerits of this situation. Ċ Scientific research help to find new discoveries and advancement of technology result in easily operated and additional featured equipments and other goods are increased in the market. For example, due to advancement in washing machine it washes the clothes and automatically delivered to heater kit and switch off after heater is completed. This saves people time and removes extra burden to monitor the washing machine. Ċ On the other hand, due to attraction of the latest equipment people are spending more money to buy latest equipment and finding reason to place their old machines in garbage. For example, people are avoiding using slight scratch in their refrigerator and buy new fridge and old ones are thrown out from their home. It is wastage of money. Due to this environment is affected by garbage which contains old equipments and machines. People are affected by technology related diseases. For example, people addicted to mobile phones and computers. Due to radiation from mobile phones may cause blurring vision, headaches and even cancer too. Ċ To conclude, buying latest equipment and replace old goods is the latest trend and most people are following this trend. It has both advantages and disadvantages. I feel that if until necessary they must not buy latest goods and it is waste of money."
9705,"It is often said that the subjects taught in schools are too acade ic in orientation and that it would be more useful for children to learn about practical matters such as home management, work and interpersonal skills. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Proper general knowledge is extremely crucial in recent times. Children in educational institutions are provided with subjects that are too mainstream, and academic in nature, but it is beneficial for them to inculcate knowledge about other logical matters and skills. This essay will argue why I completely agree that every child should be learning new skills rather than the school syllabus. Ċ Some parents usually prefer their offspring to be taught subjects that are more theoretical such as basic everyday math and social sciences. They generally opt for these because they believe that with this basic information, the students can make a successful career. Moreover,they assume that with good marks in their schooling, they can secure admission to a reputed university. For example, when youngsters receive good scores on their report cards, they are more likely to get into a well-known college. Therefore, it is important for students to focus on their studies in order to be in a better position once their education has been completed. Ċ On the contrary, a few others suggest that young minds must be educated on various managerial and communicative aspects. Although the educational system is consisting of a more traditional teaching experience, it is vital for the next generation to be coached on more practically evolved issues. Nevertheless, institutions must establish classes to enlighten these juvenile mindsets about house management, work-life balance as well as economic affairs such as tax payments. These are quite valuable for better development. For instance, the children who are enlightened about the distinctive matters together with providing the means to improve their communication skills will be more efficient in handling difficult situations. Ċ In conclusion, this essay argued that it is highly productive that teenagers are given education about social and political affairs. Hence, in my opinion, I fully agree that developing the skillset is more helpful to the students rather than the traditional academics."
9706,It has been believed that advertisement make people buy products which actually they do not require.Do you agree or disagree?,"Adverts are omnipresent. Some people think that a huge consumption of goods is so evident nowadays due to the power of advertisement, moreover, this creates an artificial needs. I strongly agree with the statement because it has been noted that commercials pursued customers to buy their products. This essay shall support my view in the following paragraphs. Ċ First and foremost, promotions are structured in a way that to attract consumers’ mind and make them purchase items. In other words, while watching a new branded product’s commercials, society often gets a feeling of comfort if they have one. As a result, the majority of viewers tend to buy these, which are absolutely no use at their homes. To illustrate, after watching some celebrity endorsements, many youngsters often buy a treadmill, in order to exercise, in the most case, however, after sometimes, the machine would not be used. Therefore, the power of promotions to make people purchase various products that are no so significant is so vivid. Ċ Additionally, advertisements cultivate a feeling in- adequacy in their target population. Slowly and gradually, the public believes buying the new gadget would upgrade their social status. Because of the motivation, large numbers of items are purchased, especially, during the time of festivals, some of these are newly emerged to widen their business, for example, Father’s day. So buying things is not proportionate with the actual wants in most cases. Ċ In conclusion, many advocates pointed out that the present high consumption rate is pure because of the unwanted requirements that are formulated by commercials. I firmly consider this is true as this media is so broad to manipulate its consumers."
9707,"TOPIC: Today, the qualities of life of people in big cities are worse. What are the causes of this problem? Any measures should be taken to solve it?","These days, it is true that the living standard in big cities decreases gradually with the increasing people living in big cities. In this essay, I will explain the causes of this trend and suggest some possible solutions. Ċ I think there are three main reasons lead to the worse qualities of living in big cities. First of all, the space of a city is limited relative to the increasing population no matter how big the city is. As a result, traffic jams and high housing prize are the most severe problem in the big cities, which not only spend people's time in vain but also raise people's stress of money. Secondly, the resources of society are limited. Because of the shortage social resources, the fierce competition in workforce market contributes to high unemployment in some big cities, as well as scrambling for limited great educational chances for children also result in instable lives. Thirdly, another important problem in the big cities is the environmental issues such as the air pollution in Beijing China. Ċ To tackle these problems, there are some measures could be taken. To improve the quality of life in big cities with some concrete problems, like traffic jams, high housing price and environmental issues, governments could issue some rules to prevent those problems from deteriorate, such as limiting the use of private cars. Ċ Furthermore, the most significant way is that governments should speed the urban development of some middle cities. Therefore, people would be willing to move to these middle cities in terms of more employment opportunities and more comfortable life styles. Ċ In conclusion, I think space and resources limited as well as environmental issues are responsible for the worse qualities of life of people in big cities. I believe that governments could address those problems gradually by various measures including developing middle cities and encouraging people to live in middle cities."
9708,"Many families move to different countries. Some people think children can benefit from this, while others consider it is hard for children if families move to a foreign country. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","A large number of families decide to move abroad, which can be beneficial to children while it is hard to handle.There are both merits and demerits to this decision, but I personally think that it will impact the children 's lives positively. Ċ Firstly, moving to another country gives the children of family to broaden their horizons. To illustrate, They have the chance to be in a different culture, which makes their position difficult to react to social issues. But with the passing time, they gradually learn to tackle these problems. As a result, their knowledge will be extended in social activities and flexibility in communicating with other people. Secondly, by living in a foreign country, they learn a new language which is valuable for their future career. Ċ On the other hand, moving to a foreign nation accompanies with challenges, including using the network support of friends and relatives and missing the acquisition of their original culture. Living abroad is similar to start from scratch and there is no support of old friends and relatives. This can be hard for children to handle at the beginning. Also, the children of families living in another country are less familiar with their maternal culture. Ultimately, they make efforts to learn the culture of their new country to be accepted in society, result in they may forget their originality, gradually. Ċ In conclusion, moving to another nation is a valuable option for children. However, there are some drawbacks which can be ignored. If families try to keep their original culture in a foreign county and pass down them to children, the moving out will improve the future of children."
9709,"Many doctors recommend that older people exercise regularly, but most patients do not follow an exercise routine.Why do you think this happens?How can people be encouraged to exercise regularly?","Most doctors convey the message that people above 60 years of age should exercise on regular basis but instead many of their patients neglect this pattern due to myriad reasons like health-related disputes and fear of injuries, which are often observed in old age people.I would like to explicate the reasons and their solutions in the upcoming paragraphs. Ċ To commence with,the first and foremost reason is that old citizensChange the determinerthat old citizenthose old citizensIt appears that the singular demonstrative that is modifying the plural noun citizens. Consider using a plural demonstrative or a singular noun instead. Ċ show examples are considered to be an asset of the country.Due to the age factor,most of them are having some health-related issues like high blood pressure which could be dangerous for them if they are engaged in some type of exercise.For ,example a survey was conducted which depicts the main reason behind heart attack in the senior citizens was that they are following some workout routine like jogging or just a normal walk.However,most of them fear that if an injury happened during the workout,it would take ample time for the old people to recover.As at this ,stage everything heals at a slower pace.In the end,people avoid working in a gym or running in a park. Ċ Every lock has a key.Similarly,every problem has a solution.Firstly,Due to modernization lot of development have taken place in the health-related sector.In other ,words individuals having health-related problems must monitor their complications on regular basics to avoid uncertainties.For example with the help of a smartwatch,individuals can monitor their heart rate and pulse.In addition to it,old citizens must use special machines that are introduced for them in the gym under the observation of a certified trainer because exercise is important for the regulation of blood vessels in our body.Thus these are some techniques which while keeping in mind one can follow their daily exercise routine that has been planned by their respective doctors. Ċ In conclusion,doctors always give pieces of advice keeping in mind the age of their patients.Although,there are many reasons like fear of injury.Apart from this person at older age suffers from health-related trouble.But if an individual takes proper precautions like monitoring their heartbeats by using modern technology as well as using gyming machines under the observation of a person can almost inevitable their issues."
9710,"Many people think technological devices such as smart phones, tablets and mobile phones bring more disadvantages than advantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Although many people reckon that modern technology has brought more downsides than benefits, I firmly disagree with that and believe that current devices assist society in myriad ways ranging from keeping in touch with relatives to guiding us the right route while we are travelling. Ċ Firstly, such devices as smartphones and tablets have made sure that relatives can communicate with each other whenever they want to and wherever they are. This strengthens relationships and gives to elder people the opportunity to feel close to their children or grandchildren even when they are abroad. Eventually, this reduces anxiety and depression and increases blessing and we can have happier people. For example, in past times without apps as Skype or Telegram, people were compelled to write and send paper letters, waited for a recipient to receive it and then struggled for an answer. Thus, it took much time and during this time worries and frustration could take over individuals. Ċ Secondly, never before can people receive help as quickly as now thanks to the technologies. In days gone by any accidents or unpredictable circumstances in which a person appeared could end up fatally because there was no Internet and no way to call on help. For instance, if you had been lost in a rainforest or in the desert or on the top of a mountain, you would not have connected to rescuers or turned on GPS-navigation in order to find a route. This was completely impossible and led to the eath of famine or freezing or so. Ċ In conclusion, I totally disagree that current devices are more detrimental than advantageous because they are able to make people closer and happier. Moreover, they can rescue people’s lives and prevent fatal disasters."
9711,People say it is the responsibility of the residents to keep the environment clean and tidy while others think it is the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion with examples.,"Maintaining and cleanliness of the environment is an important topic to discuss for society in these days. Some people argue that, it is the responsibility of the individuals to clean the surroundings and some others, argue that it is the whole responsibility of the government. In my opinion, it is joint action and both are in the position of protecting nature. This essay following the discussion of both arguments with appropriate examples. Ċ On the one hand, it has observed that the decay from the apartments is the main reason for the pollution. If the individuals try to segregate the garbage and put it into the separate waste bin, then it helped the authority to collect it effectively. Additionally, If the individuals put the garbage into the collecting point rather than throwing out the unused area. For example, in Banglore, the apartment managements are instructed owners to keep their garbage outside the home than throwing out. It had positive feedback and authority can able to see clean surroundings. Ċ On the other hand, it is an effort of the government to have a mechanism of disposing of the litter and to initiate the awareness classes to the society about the negative impact of the pollution. Furthermore, the law agencies should put extra budget and time to clean the region by building a waste collection centre. It had positive feedback to protect nature. For instance, in Karela, the government had made a system for appointing unemployed ladies to collect and clean their surroundings. It actually helped women to get the work and made a village tidy. Ċ In conclusion, in my opinion, it is a joint effort and both individuals and regional centres are responsible to protect the nature. The locals should cooperate with the centre to take considerable action for the cleanliness of the surroundings."
9712,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Haste makes waste. Use specific reasons and examples to support your response.,"Generally during our life, we are always trying to do our bests. However, sometimes by considering the condition such as lack of time, we behave more quickly which the result wouldn`t be the same as the normal condition. In my opinion, haste in doing something cause time and cost waste beside the low quality of the result. Ċ First of all, I believe that when a person is behaving in a quick manner, surly would have more faults. Thus, in order to come back and correct the faults it would take time, which results in the duplication of time for a certain job. For instance, imagine you are washing a T-shirt, In case you wash it quickly, some dirt may be remained. Therefore, you have to wash it again in order to clean it completely which cause time waste. Ċ Besides, being in a hurry in doing a job indirectly cause to cost much more than the usual time. As supplementary description, return to the example mentioned in the above paragraph. In case that you want to wash a T-shirt two times you have to use two times more material. Using two times more material means costing twice. Hence, it could be concluded that hasting in doing a job makes us to cost more. Ċ Finally, I would like to present the worst thing which results in hasting and that is the low quality.I believe that good quality could be gained in case that a person has the most accuracy in doing something. As far as,being in a hurry reduce the accuracy , so that the quality would be reduced subsequently. As mentioned in above example,it is clear that finally the T-shirt remained a little bit dirty.So,it could be concluded that haste effects on the quality in bad way. Ċ In the end,according to the above described reasons, time waste,duplication of the cost and also reduction in the quality of the result, I believe that haste makes waste."
9713,"Some people think that life is better in cities, however others claim that village life is far better. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","One of the biggest debate humans have is whether city life is better than village life or vice versa. However, I believe that rural life is far better than urban lifestyle. This essay will indulge in both views. Ċ To commence, with the multifarious reasons why some people think that cities are better place to live. The predominant one is that the availability of all facilities, such as hospitals for health treatments, college and universities for good education, shopping centres for shopping needs and so on. Whereas, people living in rural areas have to go in cities to get such amenities. Therefore, people believe that living in cities is full of provisions. Instead of this is cultural diversity. Some of the big cities attract people to come and live from different backgrounds. We can meet them and can know about their culture activities and lifestyle. Ċ Moving further, with the advantages of living in rural areas. First and foremost is that it is a pollution free place, for example air, noise, and water pollution. Villagers breath fresh air that makes them strong and healthy. While in cities, pollution is on high level, which cause many diseases. Apart from this, is fresh and organic food. It is true that people have enough space to grow their own food, for instance rice, vegetables, fruits, milk, which is free from mixture and chemicals and healthy for them. Ċ In conclusion, to agglomerating the above-mentioned viewpoints, it can be said that masses hold distinct perceptions. As both the motions are relevant to some extent."
9714,Some students prefer to study at a large university that has several thousand students. Other students prefer studying at a small school that has only a few hundred students. Which of these two types of schools do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"The question of whether to attend a big university that comprises of thousands of students or a small one that contains just a few hundred students is debatable in a lot of forums. It is commonly believed that studying at a large university will definitely be better. However, I am more in favor of enrolling for a small-sized school. The bases for my view are individual attention and friendship enhancement. Ċ First and foremost, attending a small university which consists of solely a few hundred students will surely promote the interaction between teachers and students. For example, it is commonly seen that lecturers at small universities are able to assist their students on individuals' problems. Such is a quality that small university possesses but large schools do not. Therefore, this makes it clear why studying at a small university will absolutely be an advantage. Ċ What is more, going to a small-sized university will certainly help increase the bonding among students due to the low ratio. For instance, there is no doubt that studying at small universities provides students with a lot of opportunities to socialize and help one another out with assignments. Accordingly, this will make students become more close-knit like a family. Hence, it is evident that attending small universities surely fosters social connection and teaches students to be full of love and care for the others. Ċ By way of conclusion, studying at a small university which has a low ratio of student truly helps promote the interaction among students and learning efficiency. Thus, it is clear why it is always better to attend a small university. After analyzing this subject, it is predicted that the benefits of going to a small university will forever outnumber those of a large university."
9715,Unemployment is one of the biggest problems of contemporary society. Ċ What do you think are the main causes of unemployment? Ċ What solutions can you suggest?,"Seeking livelihood has become the most challenging pursuit in today’s world. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons and provide some solutions to alleviate this situation. Ċ To commence with, the two main causes for unemployment are lack of technical skills and low employment opportunities. Candidates, for instance, focus more on the academic part of the preparation, however, neglect the fact that the organisations are in the pursuit of the skilled group. Similarly, the increasing population has made it difficult to provide jobs to the public due to relatively fewer spots in the market. Ċ While this may be the case in most countries, there are a few solutions to overcome this challenge. Firstly, it is crucial to train ourselves in the field that we are interested in to attain the required skills which is one of the main criteria of the recruitment process. For example, if we are looking to work in any company, it would be best to take a few courses based on the requirement of that particular firm. Therefore, the chances of being recruited increase to a greater extent. In addition, globalization has paved the way to provide overseas work alternatives. Various organisations across the world are attempting to hire people, resulting in providing great options for a stable income and career progression. Ċ In conclusion, after a thorough analysis of the subject, although it might seem that the unemployment in the present is mainly due to lack of mastery and low opportunities, it can be resolved by training to keep up with the competition in the area of interest and seeking work across the globe. These suggestions might help the above mentioned prevailing issue."
9716,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.","Becoming successful is almost an endless endeavor for every individual. Nevertheless, not everyone can succeed. From this standpoint, I disagree with the statement that people who want to succeed should be more like others than be different from everyone else. There are mainly two reasons for this. The first one is the definition of success for everyone is different, and the second one is being the same with others generally lacks innovation, which is fundamental to success. Ċ Although success is the primary goal for everyone, people have different views and aspects of a successful life. Some people may consider having a good carrier with high salary to be a successful life, while others may evaluate their success in other ways such as the level of happiness and spiritual contentment. Since miscellaneous people want different things, it is unfounded to suggest that everyone following the same rule is definitely able to reach success. For example, many high school students decide to go to a college after their graduation, but if a student wants to become a chief, perhaps he or she should find a job in the restaurant instead of study in a university. Not everyone needs to attend classes in a college in order to success. Ċ Furthermore, hardly do people succeed solely by imitating others' ideas or works, because this action lacks creativity. Only those who have the ability to innovate are capable of attaining extremely success. For instance, Apple Computer is one of the most successful companies in the world. If Steve Jobs, one of the founders of this company, did not have any innovative thinking, the product of Apple Computer would have nothing special, and he could not build his business empire. Ċ In a nutshell, for everyone, being like others is not enough to succeed. I suggest people should figure out what is the definition of success for them. Moreover, to become successful, the ability of innovation is of pivotal importance."
9717,"TASK: Some people think that students benefit from going to private secondary schools. Others, however, feel that private secondary schools can have a negative effect on society as a whole. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Education can be contemplated as the process of acquiring new knowledge and skills and there are many changes taking place in education system with modernism, especially in private schools. Some believe that private secondary schools are more beneficial while others oppose it. I give my view through following explanations. Ċ Private school teachers can focus on every student due to sufficient staff according for given number of students. Subsequently, they can get a chance to know students' abilities and weak points by which they can take measures to improve their standards . Furthermore, private school managements are implementing web based teaching techniques by which they can make studies more interesting and entertaining. At the same time, private schools try to enhance students' creativity and abstract thinking power by engaging students in extracurricular activities such as painting , sports, music or painting. Likewise, students in private schools learn more productive elements such as discipline and punctuality than students in government secondary schools. Ċ On the other hand, schooling in private schools are very expensive. It may be a burden to an average family. Moreover, these schools can create social discrimination like rich and poor because only affluent classes can afford such charges. In addition, students may develop negative qualities namely, not having social contacts with people from low economic status and they may treat others as inferiors. Ċ To summarize, I can say that private schools are having many facilities and their quality of education is much more better than government authorized schools but they should minimise their prices so that it is reachable to all people in the society and they should also teach about the basics of life like respect towards everybody irrespective of religion and socio-economic position."
9718,Topic Nowadays we are seeing more and more exhibitions and sculptures appearing in public. It is wrong that governments funding artist projects when there are more important things we could be doing with taxpayers' money.  To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion,"Art is the outcome of individualism in lieu of collectivism, which implies that art can only be appreciated by certain groups of people. Therefore, there are accusations against governments' attempt to support art projects financially when the money can be spent in other public services. In my opinion, it is beneficial to augment spending for public art projects. Ċ First of all, successful public art projects can stimulate tourism industry substantially. Datong, which is a common city in China, has just been crowned as the ""capital of sculpture"", as the implementation of city renascence project-reconstruction of ancient sculptures, maintenance of historical temples, and exhibitions of contemporary arts. Surprisingly, not only can citizens in Datong enjoy a more artistic environment, but also the thriving of tourism industry has created a chain effect to boosting other infrastructures, such as transportation. Therefore, public art project is an integrated part of urban development which should not be isolated. Ċ Secondly, public art projects are educational and inspirational because they can enhance self-identification as a good citizen. There are many memorial statues which are designed and build to commemorate significant historical events or to pay tribute to individuals who has rendered meaningful contributions to the society. These may not be aesthetic beauty behind them, but they are beacons to illuminate histories that should not be forgotten and to encourage the younger generation to carry on their ancestors' legacy. Ċ In conclusion, governments should be supportive to the development of art projects not only because they can boost tourism industry, but also to educate citizens"
9719,"Topic : Do you agree or disagree with this statement ""Good teachers set challenging tasks for their students?""","Today's world education become more and more competitive. Many of school or universities compete to be leader. One major part of being top school is the good teacher.Many people think that good professors leads to good tasks or researches for their students. There are one question that I always thought about is whether the good teachers can set challenging tasks for their students. In my opinion, I agree that good teachers bring good tasks for their students. for several reasons. Ċ Creative thinking is one of the most part of good teachers and this ability leads to innovative tasks. For example, my math teacher who is very creative person, He integrated his math course with the art which he is interesting and the result was great. Students seem to like it. It is easy to understand and great challenged of them. Ċ Another reasons is good teachers understand their students constraint. As a result of that ,they try to find the suitable tasks for improving their children. They know the children strength and weakpoint. So they help their student to develop their strength and eliminate their weakpoint. Ċ Lastly, good teachers also contains a lot of knowledge and more expert in their subject, so they understand the problem that their student faced and can find the best ways to solve it. Moreover, good teachers are also good learner too. They always update their class and subject with the new information or advance technology such as the internet or new relevant research papers. And that is avery good benefits for their students. They will be got good tasks that provide via internet or challenging tasks from the advance research papers. Ċ In conclusion, there are many good aspects that good teachers will provide the challenging and creative tasks for their students. This is why the top university always want to get a genious professors."
9720,Some people think imported food exerts positive impacts on our lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?,"In the recent days, foreign food items have increased a lot as people today are excited to try different and new eatables. Some of them believe that stocks that are shipped has positive effects on our lives and I completely disagree with this fact. This essay will explain, how imported eatables are affecting the human beings in an unusual manner and give reasons for the same. Ċ Firstly, the local farmers are discouraged when foreign products are marketed. In other words, home grown crops will get less attention in front of foreign food items. As a result of this, crops harvested would go to waste and the farmers will be disappointed with their poor returns that they earn. For instance, locally grown apples are not so popular in my country in front of apples that is imported from Sweden which is widely sold in the markets. Ċ On the other hand, many find the joy in other things, such as spending valuable time with family, helping others, posing a good health. Mean to say despite of having a good bank balance some won’t be having a peaceful life. For example, Steve Job, founder of Apple, even though he had a remarkable social status, hefty bank balance, he couldn’t survive with Cancer. Therefore, it is important have love, care and wonderful health to be happy. Ċ To conclude from the above discussion, imported items does not lead to any positive impacts to our lives, instead would discourage the local grown harvests. In order to lead a better and healthy lifestyle, one has to consume home food."
9721,Please help me with this topic: Do you think men should share housework with women? Why or why not?,"Moving from the previous years to the present, there is a significant change in men's attitude to the housework at home. They seem to become more involved in doing the household activities to help their wives for these following reasons. Ċ To begin with, I am believed that household chores should be distributed regardless of whoever has longer working time. The number of hours doing chores decreases as more and more women start to go out for earning money. It makes the pay gap between gender closer. Ċ Secondly, women are in arrears with the challenge of banlancing between work and family, they are unquestionably exhausted and stressed. With the men's participation in the housework, the burden as well as the pressure on women is reduced, more or less. Take my father as an example. He always spent at least four hours per day to do these things: washing dishes, cleaning the rooms...Therefore, when my mom went home, she didn't have to do much. Moreover, she gained more free time to pursuing her hobbies and of course taking an interest in my studies. Ċ Thirdly, by dint of doing more housework, men want to show their gentle, empathy and respect toward their beloved wives. Besides, it is also a perfect way to prove that their wives has made the right decision when marring them. For those women, it is very meaningful ang they feel touched. Ċ In a nutshell, the responsibilities of both work-life and family life should be shared between two partners. The more time they do the chores together, the happier their marriage is."
9722,"Some people have great ambitions in life, others don't. Do you think ambition is important to succeed in life? Is it a positive or a negative quality to have?","Ambitions are required everyone's life. It gives motivation to achieve success. It is positive quality to lead a prosperous and determined life. Ċ People have ambition then automatically they will plan to succeed it. It helps to be focused on their goals and work hard to achieve it. People would rid of their bad habits and distracting activities. It helps to get prosperous and healthy life. Through self-discipline and control people can achieve their dreams. Ambitious people solve their problem with complete will power and set right path to attain their desire. It helps to determined and motivation. For example, a person ambition to become doctor, he has to work hard and gain skill in that field to acquire their aim. Ċ On the other hand unreasonable ambition makes people to become weaker, unconfident and disappointed. It makes them selfish to focus only on their goals and will not help other which will result in loneliness. To become rich people would pursue illegal way to earn it thus it will be disastrous to the society. To become power people would be rude, aggressive, ruthless and intolerable to others and torture others to get success. For example, team leader in sales department to get high sales target would excruciate his team member to work overtime and forced them to take less break time. Ċ To conclude, ambition makes person perfect in his activities. Reasonable ambition helps to achieve success and get rewards. Without ambition life would be mechanical and meaningless. It's people responsibility to follow ethical way to achieve their ambition."
9723,"At present, the media affects people’s lives significantly. Ċ What impact does this have on society? Is it a negative or positive development?","The news broadcasting has a huge influence on public nowadays. It creates much awareness among people, almost about everything happening around the world. Moreover, it is extremely convenient for all to stay updated. Thus, certainly it is a beneficial growth. This essay will discuss its impact in detail with a suitable example. Ċ To initiate, numerous media platforms such as, TV, radio, and newspapers are easily available to everyone now. This is to say that, due to the increased access, the public is now well informed about the level of crime, types of crime, Global crisis, economy, and other significant issues prevailing. Furthermore, in the past only fewer people were aware and considered the media’s importance. To exemplify, according to a survey conducted by the University of Solan, India, in 2010, an average person spends at least 30 minutes a day to watch news channels. However, this duration was much less previously. Ċ Secondly, there are several news channels available in different languages, which provide the latest reports on the problems occurring at local, National, and international levels. In other words, it is easy for the society to choose the language and the type of coverage that they are interested in. For instance, in India, the free DTH service provides approximately 28 news channels, out of which 5 are available in Foreign languages. Hence, the exposure and convenience have greatly improved. Ċ To conclude, Mass Communication leads to a society, which is more aware. Moreover, getting updates about the world has become easier at present. Therefore, this impact on the people’s lives is a positive development."
9724,"With the development of market economies, advertising has become a dominant feature in television industry. Despite the information brought to us by television, there still exits strong criticism against TV advertising. What's your opinion?","Since the day that television has been invented, the idea of advertising has been embedded into it. For the last decades, television advertising has expanded exponentially. Meanwhile, the debate over the pros and cons of adverting is becoming more and more intensive-from the psychological impact to the anti-propaganda campaign for consumerism. In my opinion, it is necessary to curb the expansion of advertising on TV and implement more rigorous supervision. Ċ First of all, there is numerous amount of evidence to suggest that advertisements on TV can influence consumers involuntarily and the effect is multiplied for children. In the late 1980s, the notorious subliminal advertisement, which is a technique to flash pornographic pictures at a speed that cannot be identified by human eyes in advertisements, became popular. After watching this kind of advertisements, consumers will remember products better without subconsciously. However, children are more vulnerable when they are exposed to inappropriate information. Fortunately, subliminal advertisements have been banned in most of countries, which is a piece of more conclusive evidence to the requirement of stern supervision. Ċ For the television industry, adverting is losing its predominant position with the coming era of digital television. Advertising enjoyed its acme when the market was filled with analogue TVs, because audiences have limited control over the viewing process-audiences cannot skip advertisements by clicking a button-and television industry rely on the profit generated by advertising. However, for digital televisions, users can record any program on their hard drives and control the watching process at discretion. More importantly, most of digital channels are not free and the subscription fee becomes the new profit generator. Ċ All in all, despite all the detrimental influences that TV adverting has, the day that advertising goes to distinction may never come, but it is exactly why we should impose better control over it."
9725,Some people believe the best way to reduce the number of accidents on the road is to further limit the speed of the vehicle. Others think there are better ways to tackle this issue. Discuss both the views and give your opinion,"Does limiting the speed of the vehicle reduce accidents?This is the most debatable issue as few are in favour of controlling the speed of automobiles,while others argue that there are a plethora of ways to solve this problem.I believe various measures can be taken by the government to tackle the above issue.This essay shall further discuss both views with relevant examples in detail. Ċ On the one hand, from the perspectives of people who think limiting the speed reduces accidents thinks so because most of the dreadful incidents on the road occur due to uncontrolled speed.Youngsters are attracted to thrilling experiences and try to impress their friends by driving high speedy cars .Hence, they land up in unavoidable circumstances. For Instance, studies on the car accidents done in a survey in Mumbai depicts clearly that most of the mishaps are due to overspeeding.Therefore, it is believed that decreasing the speed limits on the roads will deter accidents. Ċ On the other hand,some folks argue that only controlling the speed will not solve the problem and various measures can be taken to alleviate byCorrect pronoun usageit byIt seems that there is a pronoun problem here. Ċ show examples the government.Firstly, unfortunate incidents occur when a person is drunk and drives his vehicle.Furthermore, accidents are most commonly done by an inexperienced driver.For example,famous Bollywood celebrity Salman khan was stuck in a case of drunk and drive in the initial days of his career.Henceforth, stricter enforcement of rules for issuing the driving licence and levying heavy penalty on the drunk drivers are few solutions which the government can enact upon. Ċ In conclusion, I believe, enforcing strict rules for issuing the driving licence and charging drunk drivers will solve the problem of accidents and just reducing the speed limit will not be helpful."
9726,"The older generations tend to have very traditional idea about how people should live, think and behave. However, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?","Globalisation and development in technology have changed almost every aspect of human life. Therefore, in the viewpoint of some people, traditional values about human behaviour, are no longer relevant now, while others are of diverse opinion. I believe that certain conventional ideas are outdated, however someAccept comma additionhowever, some of them are still useful today. This essay will augment my standing and provide a logical conclusion, Ċ On one hand, old beliefs about gender roles and finding a secure job after getting a degree, are no longer accepted by the youth now. To cite an example, a few decades ago, the students were encouraged to complete their graduation and get a well paying position, in their field. Being an employee in a well reputed company, meant financial freedom, earlier. But currently, the majority of the youngsters lean towards been employed for a short period of time and then starting up their own firm because of the fact that, no profession today provides freedom in terms of money. Hence, the older idea is no longer applicable. Additionally, in the yesteryears, women were solely seen as housewives and men as breadwinners, which is not the case anymore, as females are excelling in every profession.For instance, now the ladies are found in mining, medical services, teaching as well as in research and advancement. Ċ On the other hand, few customary views, still stand true. To illustrate it, the elders thought that hard work, taking pride in one's work and doing your best is really prominent for achieving success in every aspect of life, which is appropriate in modern times too. As, the cutthroat competition at work increases, it is essential that not only, every employee is given in his/her best efforts, but also endeavours. Only than any organisation as well as the individual can be successful. Moreover, politeness and respect for one and all are considered as old myths by many. Nevertheless, being respectful and courteous towards all humans, is absolutely necessary as the world is becoming a global village. Ċ To conclude, certain ancient outlooks, have become irrelevant in this new era. In spite of that, I think, many of them are still useful to man today, and if followed by the newer generations, it can lead them to huge achievements."
9727,"Some people believe in the traditional idea that the woman's place is in the home, while others say that idea is outdated and that women should play an increasingly important role in the workplace of the future. What is your opinion?","Woman is the essential part of the human beings. They are playing core roll as a daughter, Wife, Mother etc and also present themselves as successfully in many profession and business. It is depend upon woman to buildup a civilized society. As we know child is a future of nation and mother is their first teacher. So, it's very important for society how she has guided the child. Ċ Few years a go, There was various kind of tradition and customs which was never gave the respect for the woman's contribution for the society and behave with woman as in prisoner. Peoples had thought that woman can only handle the family and home. They were not allowed to even for the education. At that time Woman hadn't permission to work outside. They believed that girls are the burden for the family. Since still there are many old peoples think that women cannot do anything they are depending on man and their duty is only taking care of family and home. Ċ At a present time woman are also walks and works together with man. They are performing themselves successfully as a doctor, nurse, engineer, scientist, president, businesswoman etc. It's all possible because of education. We can see so many women who got success and respect like Marie Curie as a scientist, Florence Nightingale as a Nurse, and Dilma Rousseff President of Brazil etc. Their achievements are the good example for those whose think that woman cannot do anything. Ċ In conclusion we can say woman can play an essential role in the workplace of the future and she can equally contribute to develop the county like a man."
9728,numerous people nowadays suffer from insomnia people sleep less than before in many countries. why do people sleep less? what effects does it have on individuals and society?,"In many regions around the world, people have less sleeping hours than before. This trend, which is mainly because of the presence of possible distractions and noise pollution in these countries, has serious impacts on individuals and the society. Ċ There are a number of reasons why people sleep less nowadays. Firstly, owing to the great advances being made in technology, many much more interesting options than sleeping have become available for a person to spend their free time. Most people currently prefer to spend their leisure time chatting with their friends using Facebook, for example, or playing video games rather than going to sleep. Some of them may become addicted to such activities, exacerbating the condition even more, leading to further decreasing of sleeping hours. Another factor is that elevated noise levels experienced by urban dwellers inevitably cause sleep deprivation. By upsurging the rates of construction works and traffic congestion in cities, residents find getting into sleep is much more difficult than before. Ċ This problem has drastic effects on individuals and society. By having less sleeping hours, people will lose their ability to relax and energize their body and mind, leading to psychiatric issues such as anxiety and extreme stress. This, as a result, undermines the victims' ability to communicate with others, disrupting their social relationships. Furthermore, staying awake for long periods affect people's mental concentration and, therefore, hinder their productivity. When a driver, for instance, has fewer sleeping hours than their actual body needs, they start working fatigued and demotivated, by which they will be dangerous to not only themselves, but also to other members in society. Ċ In conclusion, wasting people's free time on other activities rather than sleeping, and increasing noise levels in some countries are the main factors behind having less sleeping hours nowadays than before. This results in negatively affecting individuals' psychological wellbeing as well as decreasing their concentration and output."
9729,"In many countries, the costs of living are rising. What are the eﬀects on individuals and society? Suggest solutions to this problem.","While numerous people need residences for their future, the expense of living can be prohibited in some cases.The causes of this appear to be affected in two areas including persons and community, and a number of solutions also appear to be possible. Ċ On the one hand, perhaps the major result here is the rising rate of homelessness who cannot afford the costs of accommodation, therefore this can affect the health and mind of individuals.The example can be seen in the rising-working hours because humans need to do more jobs, which can be paid their living expenses such as prices of electricity, water systems and other facilities.Furthermore, according to the above stage, it can also influence the mental problems of human beings.These range from exhaustion to stress.For instance, humans do not have time to relax due to their continuous employment, thus it causes the health problems like hands and legs pain, eye diseases that are gotten from using computers related to their business, especially freelancers.Moreover, the number of criminal origins are expanding because of the absence of takings.For symbol, there are several shoplifters that can be seen in urban where the security is poor. Another root is the expansion of pollution such as noise pollution and the soaring rubbish. Ċ Turning to possible solutions, an obvious step would be to reduce the taxes in some stages such as foods and residences by the government.For illustration, the tax on food is quite high, especially in restaurants, at this ,point the government should change the convenient prices that can perform all souls.Subsequently, if we took this stage, it would also lessen the crimes.Hence, a second remedy is making systematic usage, which means that citizens should not use useless things.Consequently, if mortal does this step, it would become to be a rich person. Ċ In summary, the factors of health problems and criminal cases are affected citizens and the environment.A coordinated response by the state, the taxation and saving incomes may well lessen the severity of the situation."
9730,"Some people claim that there are more disadvantages of the car than its advantages. Do you agree or disagree? Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of having a car. And just one additional question. Did I use more linking words like ""however"", ""In conclusion"" - than I should on the wheels","Nowadays, many people state that cars bring more positives rather than negatives, whilst others disagree and think that the disadvantages from motor vehicles, such as cars are significantly more. This essay argues that the advantages from cars outweigh the drawbacks. The principle advantage of cars is the convenience of the transportation, whereas the main drawback is that automobiles are the main cause of the air pollution. Ċ Cars are the easiest and cheapest mean for traveling from place to place. Nearly everybody on the planet can travel wherever he wants due to the very well developed infrastructure in the most regions of the world. Moreover, the travel by cars is considerably cheaper compared to the other means of transportation. For example, according to a research conducted by Harvard university, in every major European city, the traveling with a car is three to seven times cheaper than the travel with public transport. As a result, cars make our lives dramatically more convenient and affordable. Ċ However, it is worth noticing that motor vehicles including cars are culpable for the increasing air pollution. In addition to this, exhaust gasses emitted by cars has caused Global Worming, as well as they are the main ingredients for creating smog. Because of this, many governments have imposed strict rules for the usage of cars and have restricted the entrance of many automobiles into the city centers. On the other hand, science offers a solution to this problem, as in the last few years many car manufacturers introduced many electric and non-polluting motor vehicles. Ċ In conclusion, the disadvantages of cars are clearly overshadowed by the benefits. Therefore, having weighed up the pros and cons and as a concomitant, of the recent innovations in the car industry, I am convinced that cars should continue to be used."
9731,"we have three important parts of education: reading, writing and maths. some people think every child will benefit from a fourth skill added to the list: computer skill. Do you agree or disagree? necessary skills to obtain during education","Since the dawn of education, such skills as reading, writing, and mathematics have always played a pivotal role in graduates' development. However, due to the proliferation of technology, whether adding computing in school curriculum is positive or negative remains at the heart of numerous heated debates. This essay serves to clarify both the pros and cons of this teaching approach before coming to a reasonable conclusion. Ċ On one level, the ability to use deftly computer is of significance to young people in the current age. It is universally acknowledged that with the development of technology, a huge resource of knowledge about everything is available on the internet which is accessed widely to computers. It enables students to study wherever and whenever they want. Hence, those can trace their own inspiring place and time that they are capable of working 100 percent efficiently. Furthermore, thanks to global connection, not only can youngsters take the distance learning courses but also the adults. In addition, acquiring a good computer skill must be useful for their future fobs. In fact, nowadays, many businesses and big firm require their employees to become proficient in computer using. Ċ From another angle, however, an excessive degree of computer exposure to students exerts detrimental impacts on those. Initially, young people have the tendency to expose to the screen of laptop or computer for many long hours. This leads to a consequence that their eyes will suffer from several diseases such as being myopic, astigmatism, or even being blind for a short period of time. Moreover, adolescents rely too much on computers. Thus, some basic skills of them will not be sharpened to become able and spelling may suffer Ċ To recapitulate, computer skills is a necessary attribute to students and could be included in school syllabus. However, this course should be complementary and censorship on the level of using."
9732,Task 2: Many problems in schools are aroused by the attitude of students. How do these problems from? What should we do to change the situation?,"In the present age, it is a common sight that many teenagers are showing their bad attitude in public places which some people have concerned deeply about this. Espacially, teachers who are dealing with them all the time, some teachers say that they can not control their students anymore. Whether the school system has been caused this problems or somthing else? Ċ Many people just blame on schools and teachers that they contend that school education system has failed that why the situation is happening while ohters believe that teenagers are been spoild by their parents. To start with, many parents have only a child therefore they can not teach their child how to share with others. Also, some of them have to work both that have no time to be around their child, the child might spent most their time alone with watching TV shows without any guidence. Which could be influence the chlid's charater, when they became a student, the people can see easilly that some of them have an attitude such as an anger problems. Ċ Traditionally, in Korea, for example, the level of morality was very high that children were to be submissive to their parents as well as other adults around them, and most families were bigger.The children had forced to learn patience and knowing that they could not have everything what they want. At that time, there was no such an issue that the teenagers were showing their angers toward any adult or in public areas. Ċ To sum up, I believe that the students' attitude problems do not start from schools, bad upbringing has made them out of control and then it came to social matters. The parents should guided them stongly in proper way and make some strict rules of behaving."
9733,Write about the following topic. Ċ There are many people who go to live in different countries. To what extent should people be allowed to move freely between countries and live where they choose? What are the benefits and drawbacks of this? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.,"Immigration is nowadays becoming a noticeable issue for many countries as many people wish to live overseas. Thus, it is suggested that those people should be permitted to move independently from nations to nations whether they desire. From my perspective, I utterly disagree with that suggestion because I believe its disadvantages weigh more than its advantages. Ċ There are risks if we allow people to move freely between boundaries. The first one might be the threat of international spies. Albeit the ending of the world war II for a century, countries still need to compete against each other, there are apparent races in some subjects, such as technology advancement, yet dominant countries are the ones have advanced technology. Moreover, if people were permitted to legally settle in other nations, the crime rate could be increased dramatically because some people, especially the international criminals, consider that run to another country may help them escape the conviction. Ċ Nevertheless, I admit this could have benefits and drawbacks. Regarding the positive side, the cultural exchange could happen easier as there would be no barriers between each other. In addition, this could satisfy the appeal of occupations for those immigrants. On the other hand, there are many drawbacks including violating the city facilities, for example, running out of places at hospitals, schools, and bringing more competitions to the local citizens to find the better jobs. I believe these two drawbacks would slow every country down if the free immigration statement is approved. Ċ In conclusion, I disagree with the idea of moving freely between each region because of the outrage negative effects relating to occupations and the nationReplace the wordnationalThe word nation doesn’t seem to fit this context. Consider replacing it with a different one. Ċ show examples facilities."
9734,"These days, in many countries, more and more people are complaining about obesity, particularly the consumption of junk food. What are the reasons for this, and how could the problem solved?","Nowadays, in many countries a number of people are appealing about corpulence especially, eating the junk food. However, in many parts of the world, this problem is increasing dramatically year by year. This essay will look at the reasons for this and propose some solution. Ċ One of the main causes of the problem is that these days, people's lifestyles are changing. And many people are working long hours in this world. And they do not have time to find ingredients or healthy food. Then they may eat junk food a lot. If people eat a lot of junk food. People become obesity. In  addition, nowadays, many woman do not cook any food at home. They usually buy from the restaurants. It is also one of the maine cause. The solution is the woman should prepare the food at home. And they should encourage people to eat any food at home. Ċ Another problem is that many people do not have breakfast, lunch, or dinner at exact time. They usually eat food, when they have free time. As to the fact, if people eat something after the 6 p.m. it has harmful effect to the people's health. To tackle this issue, people must have a breakfast, lunch, or dinner at exact time. And they must not eat nothing after 6 p.m. Ċ A third cause of the problem is that junk food, fast food are not very expensive as healthy food. Therefore many people prefer to eat this kind of food a lot. And they become fat. The solution is that the many cafes should decrease the price of healthy food. Ċ In conclusion, these days, the big problem is that humanity do not eat correctly. And also this issue common in many countries. My view is that government and doctors are responsible to solve the problem."
9735,many high level of positions in companies are filled by men even though the workforce in many developed countries is more than fifty percent female. compnies should be required to allocate a certain percentage of these positions to women. to what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, it is being seen that the most senior positions in multi-national companies are occupied by men, even when there is a good percentage of women working in such industries. Many people claim that a certain number of positions should be reserved for women while many reject this notion. In my opinion, I do not agree with the statement as I firmly believe promotions should be entirely based on talent and not on any gender. Ċ Firstly, reserving high-level posts in companies can be harmful to its growth as reservations will leave them with fewer options to choose from and the most deserving candidate can lose the opportunity. For instance, if a certain position is fixed for a woman, and even if there is no eligible candidate, management will have to pick one because of the company policies, as a result, it can impact the growth and development of the company. Additionally, such policies can harm the professional relationships among employees. They may develop jealousy that can indirectly impact work. However, there are other ways that can provide equality at workplaces. Ċ I believe, there are better ways to bring equality in offices. For example, being fair and transparent can be the first step while doing promotions. Like, it is seen at various places that employees get promoted even when they are not eligible or just because of their relationships, which can be unfair for the deserving female employee perhaps. In addition to this, there can be a proper procedure of allocating posts that can give equal opportunity to all the eligible staff like by giving certain tasks or having examinations. Ċ In conclusion, allocating a percentage of positions based on gender cannot be a wise decision as it can impact the overall atmosphere of the company. Giving equal opportunities to all and being fair can be a more respectful approach to have equality at workplaces."
9736,"Some people say that television is a very useful tool when it comes to education. Others argue that television is a much overused, ineffective teacher. Discuss both of these views and give your opinion as to the usefulness of television as an educational tool.","People always have different views about the role of TV in education. While some think watching television is an effective method for teaching students, others argue that it is ineffective and has potential problems for children. In my opinion, it can be very useful if it is used under supervision. Ċ On the one hand, Some argue that teaching by television may cause a range of problems. First, most programs do not require much thought which may sometimes have a negative impact on students such as violence and crime. As a result, it is possible for children to imitate and influence their physical and mental health, even have a negative impact on society. Second, compared with teachers and books, there are limited educational resources on televisions because most of them are entertainment programs, sometimes with advertisements. Consequently, students cannot learn too much especially in their areas of interest from the television. Ċ On the other hand, there are lots of benefits in obtaining knowledge by watching television. Firstly, television programs can be informative and educational which allow viewers to have access to a huge variety of channels, For example, there are two programs in China which called “The Animal World” and the “ Historic Talk”, people can learn different spices and Chinese histories by watching video records. To be more specific, televisions can make boring subjects more attractive and easier to understand. Ċ In conclusion, although television has some drawbacks because of the lack of control, I strongly agree that it is a good tool for teaching due to it can stimulate people’s interest in learning. In addition, colourful videos make all knowledge more interesting and real."
9737,"In the past, when students did a university degree, they tended to study in their own country. Nowadays, they have the opportunity to study abroad. Ċ What are the advantages and disadvantages of this development? Ċ You should use your own ideas, knowledge, and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.","Many undergraduates were educated in educational institutions in their own country one century ago. In the present, they have the possibility to study overseas. There are merits and demerits for students. I am inclined to believe foreign universities provide many opportunities for graduates. Ċ Nowadays, a lot of pupils prefer to study abroad rather than in their own country. It is related to the fact that many academies offer many advantages for graduates, for example: if a potential student passes exams perfectly, he or she will get free scholarship and citizenship in the future. Also this opportunity allows graduates to feel the international education system and different lifestyle. Based on my experience, changes and possibilities provided by foreign countries and universities can change a student's life totally in a positive way. Ċ Meanwhile, there are disadvantages, some scholars can not get used to another life’s tempo. Moreover, students have to face difficulties that they can not endure. According to the magazine “The International student’s lifestyle”, approximately 30% of students have to return to their country. This is related to various pressures they faced during the education process. For example: my brother studies in the university of engineering and computer technologies in Moscow and he said that some of his classmates had had lower grades in final exams and had to change the university. Ċ In a nutshell, abroad scholarship has many merits and demerits. Foreign universities' lifestyles offer a lot of possibilities. Potential alumnus will have to adapt and be ready for many difficulties due to the pros outweigh the cons."
9738,Teenagers should never be put in the same prison with adults no matter how serious their crime is. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?,"Nowadays, youngsters are involved in an oflot crimes in society which warrants a jail term. It has been suggested that they should not be put in the same cell as grown-ups for certain reasons, and I completely agree with the opinion. This essay will discuss why these two groups of persons should not be locked together. Ċ Teenagers should not be confined in the same area as adults in a correctional facility for several reasons. Firstly, they may get abused and assaulted in the prison, due to the fact that when older inmates are kept with younger ones , they tend to feel a sense of superiority and may begin to abuse the little ones. For example, a case like this was reported at a Prison in Nigeria, where a nineteen years old boy was beaten to a coma by oldsters in the same space for refusing to wash their clothes. In addition, some of them end up getting molested sexually, which would not have been so if they had separate rooms. Ċ Furthermore, a lot of adolescents may come down with behavioural problems if allowed to stay with people above their age group, because some may end up picking bad habits and learn antisocial behaviours from these seniors and may even come out from jail worse than how they went it. For instance, studies in the past decades have revealed that about 70% of youths who were convicted came out worse than they were before going to jail, as a result, society,Remove the commaapplyThe comma may be separating the subject and verb in your sentence. Consider removing it. Ċ show examples continues to suffer. Also, some of them have reported being cajoled by these persons into engaging in practices such as smoking. Ċ In conclusion, I think it is safer and wiser for prisons to have different cells for adults and youths."
9739,"should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.","Development in any field indicates sign of progress. Similarly infrastructure of city improves with the development of new buildings and premises. However many argue to retain the old buildings due to its historical importance. It is incomprehensible whether to remove historical buildings by building new ones as both have their distinct benefits and importance. In my opinion, it is better for cities to build new buildings to cop up with the rapidly evolving world. Ċ Firstly, constructing new building would improve over all architecture and infrastructure of the city because modern designs and patterns would be used. For instance Dubai, a well-developed city of opportunities has recently completed construction of World's biggest mall; it has more than 1800 stores to facilitate citizens and visitors, that offer's versatile collection of clothing and International brands. Many restaurants and saloons are also included in the directory of mall. Moreover, it has become must visit place of Dubai for the tourists due to its exquisite features and having its name in Genius book of the world. Ċ Secondly, new building would require low maintenance but provide ancillary facilities require by building owners such as parking, Lifts and escalators rather than staircases. It would also help many international companies to build their offices in the city that would enhance businesses and employment opportunities. Government would earn more revenue due to industrial and corporate developments. Adding to it, residence would get options of purchasing modern and fancy houses. New buildings would have enough parking spaces that will discourage people to park anywhere in the city. Ċ Historical buildings have different aesthetic value but they are difficult to maintain. Also it would require healthy sum of money periodically. On the other hand, new buildings would have all numerous hi tech facilities at the cost of less efforts and resources to maintain it."
9740,topic In order to improve safety on our roads more severe punishment should be established for driving offenses. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"When it comes to traffic accident, some assert that severe penalty should be imposed, in a bid to improve security. I agree with the view that this action will curb the offenses, but still, other approaches can more or less reduce traffic violations. Ċ Plainly one of the effective punishments is more serious penalty points. Recently, in China, the Department of Transportation put a regulation which doubts the penalty points for breaking traffic light into practice, this means if you disobey traffic light in twice, your driving license will be disqualified. Thanks to this drivers become more aware of traffic law and comply with it better since they know the more serious consequences after violating. Ċ Moreover, more severe fining system surely enables to cut down the quantity of offences. Which can give credence to this point is the case of my father's friend. In the past, the over speeding was only punished through verbal warning and 2 penalty points. My father's friend often drives as fast as he wants. After having to pay the fine as considerable as 500 yuan for this disobedient, never does he drive over the speed limit. Therefore, intensifying retribution suppresses people's attempt to break the traffic laws. Ċ It is not to say, however, other approaches can be ignored. For example, setting up more stringent driving test to enhance driver's proficiency; propagating potential jeopardy of disobedient to educate public. Indeed, those actions can make offenses lessen, in contrast, retribution could have direct influence on curtailing traffic crimes. Ċ On the whole, the combination of severe punishment and other approaches is the best recipe for making our road safer"
9741,Many people prefer to use public transportation while others say that personal cars are the best mode of transportation. Excessive use of private cars is considered to be the main reason for the traffic jam in many cities and that's why the use of public transportation is encouraged. Ċ In your opinion what are the pros and cons of using public transport?,"Over the recent years, public transport has become increasingly popular. One of the main benefits of using public transport is that it reduces air pollution and thus, slows down global warming. However, there are problems associated with it. The following paragraphs will analyze the merits and demerits of public transportations. Ċ To commence with the positive sides of public transportation, first and foremost it is more environmentally friendly compared to private cars. Take, for example, trains or busses. One bus can cater for around 30 to 50 people. This dramatically reduces the number of vehicles on the roads. Consequently, if more and more people use public transportation, the air in cities will be of better quality. Additionally, roads will be less congested, which in turn will affect the mental well-being of individuals as they will experience less anger and anxiety. Last but not least, it is economically efficient. Individuals using busses or trains don't have to bear expenses for car maintenance, purchasing fossils, and etc. Ċ On the downside, during the rush hours, public transport is inconvenient. Commuting to work every morning on an overcrowded bus or subway train is not a pleasant experience. Moreover, even in developed cities, busses are unreliable. For instance, in the morning people need to get to their workplaces or educational institutions. But frequently, individuals feel stressed because the bus didn't arrive and he/ she are being late. Ċ To conclude, public transportation can sometimes be overcrowded and inefficient. Even so, it has a number of advantages for individuals, the economy, and the environment. Overall, I believe that the merits outweigh the demerits."
9742,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars,"A famous proverb ""Knowledge is power"" has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work. Ċ University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today's world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc. Ċ Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. M.Phils. and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities. Ċ Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate."
9743,Young people say that traveling to different countries benefits them and the society. Do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion.,"The idea that traveling young generation abroad at the first glance may not seem to waste huge amount of money. Nevertheless traveling young adults to foreign countries can be benefit for themselves and their society. In this essay, I will explain why going to other countries can be useful for adolescences and their societies. Ċ To begin with, communicating with foreign persons gives young adults a chance to know about their culture. Differences and similarities between some difference societies make young adults to think about geography, history and some religious and how these parameters can change people's lifestyle. Such these analyses may make young generation to have opened minded. What is more, by traveling to foreign countries, adolescences may visit how new technology improves others' economy and standard of living. Therefore, young generation try to follow some new business or habits. For example in developed countries, many new electrical devices are emerged to help people to have better life. Visiting people living in better condition encourages young people to apply some new technology which has not been in their own society. Ċ In addition, some other countries has specific feature which gives huge amount of pleasure to young adults. When young adults come back to their countries, they have huge amount of energy to follow their work and study. Working and studying more seriously make high efficiency for society and individuals. For instance, in my country, many new graduate students and young employees travel to near countries during long holiday, because of long wonderful beaches which are not in my country. Ċ In conclusion, going to foreign countries gives adolescences a chance to extend their ideas about life and some perspective of it. These new thought may develop their life and their society. Young adults may be impressed by new atmosphere of other counties, so they refresh hugely"
9744,Question: In most countries multinational companies and their products are becoming more and more important. This trend is seriously damaging our quality of life. Do you agree or disagree? are multinational companies a threat to us?,"Multinational companies and their products have become an integral part of people's lives . Never before have multinational companies played such a pivotal role in society. Today, both manufacturing and distribution have gone global, increasing the quantity and variety of goods while driving down the price. Despite their potential threat to local environment, they improve life rather than destroying it. Ċ Multinational companies may jeopardize environment in developing countries by setting up factories there. First, the need for raw material would drive companies to use up natural resources in developing countries where legislation and law enforcement for environmental protection are often scarcely upheld. Second, these manufacture factories are highly pollutive. Dirty water, carbon emission, and polluted air from these manufacturing sites could harm the health of residents. Ċ Yet the arrival of multinational companies can boom the local economy. It provides plentiful job opportunities to locals who are desperate to earn a living. Factories built overseas are usually labor-intensive, thus could hire a large local workforce. Wages from multinational companies would enhance local purchase force, contributing to a dynamic economy. Employed by such companies, parents could also provide better schooling for their children, which could pull deprived families out of the poverty cycle.Customers could benefit from multinational companies. First, these companies provide alternatives to local products. KFC, a global food chain, for example, serves western fast food which local restaurants in Asia do not provide . Second, products from multinationals could be more cost-effective, as they are manufactured in areas where labor and natural resources are cheap. Ċ In conclusion, though global companies may harm the environment of the developing world, they could bring benefits to their customers as well as the economy of where their products are manufactured."
9745,"The increase in food production is mostly due to fertilisers and better machinery. Yet, some think that it harms human health and communities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It would be argued by some that high schools should make unpaid community service a compulsory part of the curriculum. To a certain extent, I agree that society and the students seem to benefit from it. However, I also think that unpaid work should just be a voluntary programme. Ċ On the one hand, many teenagers, who are not mature enough, do not know how to properly accomplish the tasks. Due to their lack of practical experience, the elderly people will have to take the time to instruct them in work and this eventually causes more problems than the heavy workload. Furthermore, most students are already under academic pressure, without being given the added responsibility of working in their spare time. Take the Vietnamese students as an example, their busy schedule, including eleven subjects, make them feel overwhelmed because they are required to complete all homework assignments. Therefore, forcing young people to do something is theoretical and can lead to resentment among them. Ċ On the other hand, teenagers can learn innumerable moral lessons from assisting others and be encouraged to dedicate themselves to society. Additionally, attending extracurricular activities allow them to learn some new life skills not be taught in class, namely time management, self–awareness, interpersonal skills. To elaborate, these skills gained through charitable work can be an asset on their CV and, consequently, increase their future employability. Ċ In conclusion, unpaid community services implementation may bring some advantages to individuals and the whole society but I believe that it should be a mandatory part of the school curriculum."
9746,Many people feel that urban environments are more unhealthy than they have ever been. What do you think are the main causes of this problem? What measures can be effective in tackling this problem?,"Nowadays, structure, urban communities, metropolitan areas, has significantly changed because of the developing business area. Some people believe that living in the city is currently turning out to be more and more unhealthy. Personally, I will feature a couple of mental causes and recommendations on how to improve this circumstance. Ċ At first, a major problem like an unhealthy urban action is predominate made by environmental pollution. One of the most noteworthy drives of environmental pollution is certainly industrialization. Industrial facilities without channel frameworks can discharge harmful gases into the atmosphere and release negative oils into water resources; accordingly, pollutions have become gotten unavoidable. Therefore, the most well-known matter in urban areas is vehicle emanations. While tremendous measures of vehicles are broadly utilized for regular daily life which can cause traffic jam one of the most stressful problem in big cities, with the huge amount of vehicles can create such harmful smoke that emanates from vehicles into the air. Breathing with this emanations is very treacherous. Thus, urban communities have transformed into unhealthier places than at any other time. Ċ In any case, so as to carry an answer for the matter of undesirable urban life, it could be a useful plan to channel and control industrial facilities. Governments could be in control to channel plant smokestacks and should ban the release of unsafe fluids into water assets. Attributable to making these goals, genuine, contaminations of the condition can be managed promptly. Moreover, these arrangements could give a sound, clean and safe lifestyle in urban. On the other hand, the problem of vehicle emanation can be solved by suggesting people to go for bike, walk and to use public transportation such as bus, train or subway. By doing this, it can reduce the amount of vehicle so that it will be less of the harmful smoke which emanate from vehicles. Ċ To conclude, the affair of urbanization that is unfortunate these days can be settled by two compelling arrangements which are managing ecological issues and encourage people to use public transportation, bike and walk."
9747,"Rising university fees and scarce employment prospects for graduates have led some people to say that universities should not teach arts subjects, like philosophy, and history, and only offer practical degree courses that maximize chances of employment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Sky soaring university fees and decreasing employment opportunities have led certain people to say that only practical courses such as medicine, engineering and architect should be offered by educational institutes, as they increase the pupil's chances of landing a job, while others are of diverse opinion. However, in my view, artistic subjects are equally important for the overall development of the mankind and hence, universities should provide them for students who are interested in pursuing them. Several arguments that augment my standing, are discussed in this essay. Ċ Firstly, it is baseless to believe that art graduates do not have any chances of landing high paying jobs. Numerous jobs in this sector, such as newspaper editors, journalists, multimedia designers, interior designers, lecturers and museum co-ordinators are paid in thousands monthly. Additionally, nowadays, several big organizations like google and apple are hiring graduates from art field, as they are often very creative and possess unique ideas, which allows their companies, to present the human civilization with freshest products and concepts. To cite an example, the recent employment report of google indicated that, 50% of their employees held certificates in varied artistic subjects and not in IT or management. Ċ Secondly, the nation might lose its culture and heritage, if no learners choose to pursue the studies, that fall under the category of arts. This category produces the artists, singers, painters and historians. These professionals work towards betterment of the society and maintaining the ethnicity of any region through their works. For instance, in recent years, the number of dancers has united in India, to save its traditional dance form Kathakali, which would now have been extinct.Thus, it is important that colleges offer these study options, for the sake of preserving the authenticity. Ċ To conclude, even though degrees in the field of science and commerce, maximize the likelihood of getting jobs, the thought that art students, are generally paid low or are unemployed is ridiculous. Also, it is needed to uphold the cultural value of any city, which makes professionals in this sector inevitably important."
9748,"Illiteracy continues to be a concern for many countries in the world today. What are the causes of illiteracy in the modern world, and what effects does it have on the people concerned and on society as a whole?","Many countries present-day supported with terrible worries about their literacy. There seem to be main causes such as quitting school and cutting edge technologies, whereas illiteracy has effects on economics role of country and human's degradation. Ċ To begin, some children starting their education without finishing it. In other words, students unwilling to study, lose concentration and motivation for acquiring knowledge, thus they simply quit school without a sufficient degree level. For example, recent research shows that countries with the vast majority of unfinished school people have 20% higher unintelligence. Another origin is that nowadays modern technologies have relieved mankind from concerning about grammar. It is not necessary anymore to learn hard grammar due to new technologies; people are relying on artificial intelligence which checking word spelling, punctuation, and sentence collocation because they think that machines cannot be mistaken. Ċ The effects of illiteracy on a country would lead to its financial and political situation down. It is common knowledge that politics and economics are the spheres that required high intelligence, however, if the nation of a country is uneducated all social aspects would be tackled included economic decline and political ignorance. In addition, without sufficient effort in studying, illiteracy would simply affect human's reverse evolution. To illustrate, there is research conducted by Cambridge University that shows the results of the questionnaire for people who haven't finished school and ten years later replied on the same questions, besides their answer time took longer and IQ level became lower. Ċ In conclusion, nowadays many nations are in trouble with ignorance that causes school quitting and rapidly developing devices. It is logical to conclude that illiteracy has negative effects on a noticeable low country position in comparison with others, moreover, the degradation of mankind perhaps inevitably."
9749,Many young people in the workforce today change their jobs or careers every few years. What do you think are the reasons for this？ Do the advantage of this outweigh the disadvantage？ young people change their jobs every few years,"Nowadays, many young people in the workforce choose other jobs or occupations every few years because they think that this can benefit themselves. I do not think that the advantages of changing jobs outweigh the disadvantages from many aspects. Ċ There are some reasons why young people would change their jobs every few years. For instance, changing the workplace can help them develop other professional skills. Because it is more competitive for young people in the workforce today than in the past, learning more skills in workplaces can give them more job opportunities. Besides, this phenomenon usually results from the payment. If other positions or occupations offer a better salary, they are easily to change their jobs. In general, young people can get benefits from changing jobs or careers. Ċ On the other hand, changing jobs too often has some disadvantages. Firstly, this may post a threat to their job security. Employers are easily to think that they are not loyal to their companies. Secondly, if young people change jobs too often, they might lose chances of promotion. It could be seen in many companies that most managers or directors are experienced and have devoted themselves to the same position or company for several years. Thirdly, for those young people who are easily to change their job often, they have to spend time on searching a new room or flat as well to shorten their traveling time to work. Ċ From my point of view, there are both advantages and disadvantages of changing a job or career. If young people intend to change their work or occupation every few years, they have to compare the pros and cons."
9750,Task 2: Example 17: Schools should not force children to learn a foreign language. To what extent do you agree with this statement? foreign language knowledge is a must!,"It is arguable whether or not students should be required to learn foreign languages by educational institutions. From my perspective, i completely agree with this view. Ċ First of all, it is belived that students can derive great benefits from learning other languages. For example, English is deemed to be the most prevalent language in the world, thus if we have understanding of it, we will gain more chances to communicate with foriegners, and narrow the gap between 2 countries. Beside, it is apparent fact that people who tend to have knowledge of foreign languages could be prioritized and obtained a well-paid job, even the job progression in many companies because those people are able to meet the demand for communication with other nations. For this reason, the option of learning overseas languages is of importance for people in globalised world. Ċ Second of all, i also believe that people who are not learned about language-related subjects are likely to have fewer choices in today's world. In some underprivileged countries like Africa, for instance, children are deprived of chances to study foreign languages because this is sometimes prohibitively expensive and beyond what their families manage to afford. As a result, these youngsters would not find a optimum profession, even be unemployable due to high needs of people having ability to know various languages from a large number of corporations. Educational institutions, therefore, should provide more occasions for student to be exposed to the foreign languages, leading to a well-trained workforce in the future. Ċ In conclusion, i totally agree that teenagers should be forced to learn more foreign languages because of its undeniable benefits."
9751,"Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?","Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more. Ċ Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life. Ċ Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals ,so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable. Ċ Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. Ċ To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays human needs for farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals."
9752,In many countries airlines are dropping their prices. Is it a positive or a negative development? Give your opinion and examples.,"These says traveling by airline is not very expensive. Some people believe that decreasing the fee of airplane has positive effects on development, while others have opposite view. Both situations are explained in this essay. Ċ To begin with, since the price of traveling by airplane reduces, the popularity of air traveling rises among regular people considerably. Therefore, many people tend to travel to foreign countries for entertainment and business. Various people can know about others' culture and customs. some exchanging culture may happen in the high rate. Also, Trade between countries can be increased, which provides better economy specially in developing countries. For example, tourist industry become more profitable. Many small industries which depend on tourist may be extended considerably. Ċ On the other hand, reducing the fee of airline may increase some problems. The number of flight during day increases rapidly because more usual people want to use reasonable and comfortable transportation. Since planes are worked by fossil fuels, air pollution is the most obvious problem. Also, increasing the number of flights may rise extra money such as tax and may affect the schedules of flights. Many flights may be schedules at the early morning or late night, which causes extra money to transport for regular passengers. Ċ Moreover, decreasing the fee of flights can have bad effects on the discipline of airlines. by gaining the popularity of air traveling, shortage of professional pilots and flight attendance may emerge. This problem can rise many crashes. Ċ In conclusion, decreasing the fee of air lines cannot help regular people to travel better. This action has indirect negative impacts on standard of regular flights."
9753,"In some countries, people who are unemployed receive a sum of money each week in the form of a benefit, while some support this, other people believe that this money should not be given. Discuss both points of view and give your own point of view","In many parts of the world, the unemployment rate has sky-rocketed. To tackle the scourge of unemployment, many nations are bestowing unemployment perks to those who don't have a job.While some are in favour of this scheme, others are against this notion. In my opinion, providing monetary benefits to the jobless is not a sustainable solution to eradicate unemployment.This essay will examine both viewpoints and derive a conclusion. Ċ Firstly, people will take the payment provided for granted. They will feel entitled to the payment and also might misuse the money. For example, instead of spending it on essentials, they might splurge it on vices like smoking or alcohol. Consequently, living on unemployment sum might make a person lazy. It will adversely affect their skill set as they don't take any pain to find a job or to improve their work skills. For instance, if a person has not worked for a prolonged period of time, it will be extremely difficult for him to start over a new job as he might have lost touch with his skills. So overall, supporting the unemployed with cash is not a long-term feasible process. Ċ On the other hand, there are a few benefits to the support scheme. First off, it can be a great help to impoverished families. Parents will be able to pay for their children's education and also take care of their needs. In many rural areas, people are struggling to meet their daily necessities, so f this scheme can be extremely beneficial for them. Also, they can save the money they get weekly and invest it for future use or in case of any emergency situations like hospitalisation. However, these can be easily managed if a person is employed and is working hard. Ċ In a nutshell, although there are few pros to monetary benefits given to the unemployed as it supports them in their day to day needs, it is not a sustainable programme. Merely providing money will make people lazy and deter them from developing their skills."
9754,Question:  Movies and books can reflect the ideas and the spirit of a particular period. What have you learned about a place or its people from watching films or reading books? Use specific examples and details to support your response.,"In modern life, people not only need to work for earning enough money but we also need to relax and watching movies and reading books are some of the best way for entertainment. You can also learn many things about life by doing this. Ċ Movies and books can reflect the ideas and the spirit of a particular period. As you know, the Titanic movies is one of the most famous films. Everyone like watching because of its romance, beautiful love, and the most important reason is because it recalls about an event that the Titanic was sunk and many people died because of that, this event made the movie become very famous even before this movie was shown. Ċ We also have a lot of documentary movies or books that are about historical events, famous people who have achieve a great work and many beautiful places all over the world. Through those, we can learn about cultures and traditions of other countries. We can also learn how to help people, what we have to do to live more beautifully. We know that this world needs our contributions and we're responsible for that. Ċ Learning something that is interesting to you is easier than learning something that is boring. Because of that, while you are watching movies or reading books, you are relaxed but you also learn something that you need for life. It's one of the best way to enrich your knowledge and save time. Ċ Therefore, the industry of making movies and publishing books is now developing. We can consider movies and books as the second world that is familiar to our life."
9755,In many places the role of father and mother is changing. Do you think it’s a positive or negative development?,"It has been argued that in many parts of the world the parents have changed their roles. I think that it's a positive development, as at the end of the day the grooming of kids is important, whether it's being done by the father or the mother. Ċ The personality of the kid depends upon the mentoring. In many places, the mothers have assumed the role of an earning member of the family, and the fathers have started babysitting, which has a positive impact on the personality development of the child, and I also back this view. The youngsters will have a close bondage with the dads and will acquire the traits of male dominance like bravery. For instance, the inhabitants of the USA have been practicing the same for the last 25 years. Thus, being trained by the daddy has a long lasting effect on the young one. Ċ On the other hand, parenting is a unique subject and males are generally weak in it. The babies, especially the girls, have some specific needs that need to be addressed by the mothers. Moreover, the brought up of the family is an innate feminine nature that helps in the character development of the child. But if the roles are swapped, then there would be hardly any difference in the final outcome. For example, the villages of Pakistan follow this old version. So, the change of position will positively effect the brought up of the juniors. Ċ To conclude, the interchangeable parenting responsibilities enhances the functional outcome, thereby making them a better person and a responsible citizen."
9756,"Sometimes people think that young people should be encouraged to leave their family at certain age, while others think that it is better for them to remain with their families. What is your view.","Some people believed that youngsters are predisposed to many risks, and thus, should stay back in their homes at all times. However, others think that they should be supported to leave their families at some time. In my view, growing children should be given opportunity to live away from their homes from about 14 to 15 years. Ċ One good reason why young ones should be encouraged to leave their house at some age is the need to become independent. This could be achieved by registering them in a boarding school where they would live in the school environment under scrutiny with other students. By this means, they not only become independent, but also learn how to interact with strangers, thereby improving on both communication and social skills. For instance, I could remember that when I was in the college, I relied on my parents for virtually everything, such as waking up in the morning and washing my clothes, in junior classes because I was a day student, but I became so independent while in senior classes when I moved to live in the boarding room. Ċ Another point to consider is that living outside one's house enables young persons to learn other people's way of life. In other words, they would have a diversified knowledge and culture. It may also include good moral behaviours and other skills such as a style of cooking, prayer and respect. For example, my nephew, John, who was known to be very rude was noticed to have become very obedient after spending 5 weeks holidays in his uncle's place in Abuja. His sudden change was attributed to the attitudes of his cousins whom are known to be calm, humble and respectful. Ċ In conclusion, although people may vary in their opinion, I believe that being independent and having diversified knowledge are very important reasons why youngsters should be motivated to leave their families at about 14 to 15 years sometimes."
9757,Teenagers face a lot of difficulties at home and at school. Ċ What are the causes for this? Ċ How can parents provide solutions?,"Generally, adolescence may witness many challenges at the institute and at home. The main cause behind this is their tender youth and lack of decision making capacity. Parents can provide support and guide them through this age by having timely communication. Ċ To start with, youngsters today face problems in taking the right decisions at university or at home. In other words, they don't have the experience to take right decision in life. As a result, youngsters today are confused. In addition, there are hormonal changes in their body at that early age, which is why it becomes difficult to maintain the balance between mind and body. For example, in a survey conducted at Mumbai university, out of 10000 parents 8000 parents have witnessed changes in their infant behaviour at a very young age. Ċ However, parents can try and communicate with their juvenile frequently. In other words, try to understand, what are they thinking? What is their mentality and how do they plan to address a variety of problems faced at the department. If the parents are ready to shell out some time of their busy routine, which will help them to build a good rapport with their offspring. Thus, by being open to communication can resolve most of the problem and ultimately offspring becomes approachable. Ċ In conclusion, youngsters will always face difficulty in an institute or at home, due to changes in hormones.But, it is the responsibility of parents to start communicating and discuss the difficulties and help them resolve it a appropriate way."
9758,All pare ts want the best opportunity for their children. There are some people who think that schools should teach children skills but others think having a range of subjects is better for a children's future. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Every parent wants their children's best, hence, some people believing that schools ought to focus on skills, while others consider having a number of subjects more important for a child’s future. In my opinion, I consider that being exposed to a wide range of subjects helps children to adapt and communicate easily. Ċ On the one hand, some think that having a knowledge in different areas of study helps a child to adapt faster as an adult and I agree. In other words, when students are predisposed to a wide range of courses, they would have the basic knowledge in them, and thus, be able to make an adjustment if need be. To illustrate, someone who majored in an engineering course in the university, would be able to work in an accounts department with minimal training. Furthermore, learning different branches of study makes communication and understanding a lot easier. For instance, an accountant who visits a hospital for a sickness can easily understand a doctor's explanation with little difficulty because he/she has a basic knowledge in biology. Ċ On the other hand, it is often believed that teachers should concentrate on skills to ensure future employment. Skills are seen to be very useful for most employers to avoid the high cost of training their staff. Therefore, they believe that if one has a skill in a particular field, it would go a long way in fetching and securing their job. For example, a caterer who does not have a skill in food management would remain jobless. Another point to consider is the shortage of spaces for employment, especially in developing countries which increases the rate of unemployment. However, with adequate skills, people can set up their own businesses and manage them easily. Ċ In conclusion, although people may vary in their opinions, I believe that exposure to a wide range of courses prepares a child better for the future in terms of adaptation and communication."
9759,Nowadays parents give more freedom to their children than in the past. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.,"These days children are given lot more privacy and space by thier caretakers than they did in the last few decades. This increased liberty definitely acts as steppin stone to a charismatic personality and also serves valuable life experiences for the children, if it is used in right direction. Ċ There are numerous benefits of giving freedom to the children. Firstly, it thrives to improve their decision-making skills and bring out the best in them. Moreover, experience is the best teacher and children gain Lion's share of life experiences when they are on their own. To illustrate, a child who is free to make his or her life decision tend to learn a lot about interpersonal skills than their counterparts, especially when they make mistakes. Although when children are given more freedom they fall and make mistakes, these wrong and mistakes play an indispensable role in developing their personality and characteristics. Ċ While this increased freedom has several advantages, too much of anything may do more harm than good. Parents should know when to put down their foot to avoid undesirable consequences. Afterall, parents always think in the best interest of their children and putting certain boundaries may protect their offsprings from plethora of crimes. To illustrate, cyber crime is one of the biggest and most complicated problem in the cyber world and if given unlimited and unsupervised internet access to children may increase their susceptibility to fall prey to such crimes. Hence in certain situations, it is absolutely necessary to restraint children in order to protect them from mishaps Ċ In conclusion,giving freedom to children may teach them many life-surviving skills and bring out their best personality. However, interference in few situations by parents is utmost necessary in order to protect innocent children from becoming victims to crimes."
9760,"Doctors recommend that older people exercise regularly. However, many older people do not exercise enough. What could be the reason for this? What can be done to encourage them to physical activities?","Doing physical exercise ought to be a part of people’s daily routine. Doctors suggest doing physical activities in older ages, while many aged populations do not consider doing enough exercise. The reason is due to a lack of awareness among them. This can be avoided by creating awareness for them. Ċ The foremost reason for not obeying doctor’s advice is lack of awareness among older people. They do not get proper encouragement from their family members, and young adults in the house do not involve them while doing physical activities. In addition, most of the time before retirement is being spent work in any organization. Thus, no time is allocated to take care of their health. For example, in India, no proper system is available to promote health benefits if people maintain fitness. As a result, many end up with serious medical problems. Ċ Promoting regular exercises can be done by creating awareness among the aged population. The adults in the family ought to involve their aged members to actively participate in the event that promotes various health benefits. Furthermore, they can be even taken to some parks and beaches to start with simple exercises as an initiative. Moreover, the government should publish more advertisements in public places where a larger crowd is being gathered. For instance, by making a law stating that the company consists of more than 500 workers should have a place for every day’s physical activities. By doing this, the habit can be followed even when they get old. Therefore, physical fitness improves, and it leads to less hospitalization. Ċ In conclusion, health is more important than anything else in the world. So it is the individual and society’s responsibility to create awareness and help older people to stay fit and healthy."
9761,"Some people think that schools should switch from print textbooks to digital textbooks on tablets, while others disagree. Ċ Discuss both point of view and give your own opinion.","The argument that students' textbooks should be replaced by electronic books on tablets is both supported and refuted by many. In my opinion, even though digital technologies appear as a suitable learning tool for students, there are still indisputable advantages to continue using printed books since they do not distract students from the educational process and do not contribute to serious health problems as well as tablets do. Ċ On the one hand, proponents of tablets believe that these devices contain many technological features that cannot be found in print textbooks. The reason for this is that tablets often give users a wide range of text formatting instruments as well as searching function and using multimedia objects. As a result, this interactive approach allows increasing not only students' creativity but also motivation to the learning process. However, despite the apparent attractiveness, tablets are often believed to have many distractions for students, such as enthralling games and irrelevant content on the Internet. Ċ On the other hand, opponents of using handheld technological devices assume that tablets are frequently associated with a range of ailments and I agree with them. Not only do electronic devices cause Computer Vision Syndrome, which is manifested by eye strain and migraines, but also provoke different musculoskeletal disorders, such as shoulder pain and fibromyalgia. As a consequence, the long-term use of tablets for educational purposes is made not universally possible. For instance, having carried out research among school children, scientists have revealed that the recommended time for working with the tablet for children should not exceed two hours a day, otherwise without being time-restricted using digital devices will affect children's health. Ċ In conclusion, though people may vary in their opinion, I am firmly convinced that completely switch to electronic devices from print books does not seem possible yet. On no account should the impact of tablets on children's well-being and distraction in the learning process be ignored, although one could not but admit the broad capabilities of tablets in terms of interactivity and graphic support of learning materials for educational purposes."
9762,"In many countries, people do not recycle their rubbish as much as they could. Why do you think it is? What can be done to change this?","In many nations, people do not truly focus on garbage recycling which results from several reasons. Nevertheless, reasonable solutions can be taken to tackle this problem. Ċ Obviously, the major cause of this matter is the recycling process, which is complicated and time-consuming. Even some materials are not multipurpose enough to be recycled, so it is not worthwhile for people to do this. For example, used plastic bags and paper can only be reused as decoration, which might take lots of effort for some people to think of ideas on how to recycle them reasonably, like making a gift wrap. In addition, inadequate education is also to be blame. It seems to me that most schools around the world neglect valuable lessons on the importance of recycling that people, especially the young, do not get the knowledge, probably because these lessons are considered more impractical than other subjects. Ċ Nonetheless, in order to combat this trend, it is vital that the following solutions are applied. First, schools should add more lessons about recycling to curriculums to encourage students to recycle. Teachers can show documentary for students to watch or organize competitions and games to test their understanding. Second, governments should impose laws to the public. Particularly, individuals who do not sort every type of waste materials should be heavily fined. Lastly, the governments have to make recycling facilities available everywhere too, like placing recycling cans on streets and buildings, which reminds citizens to recycle. Ċ In conclusion, complex recycling stages and lack of education are the main contributions to this matter, which can be solved by taking the steps mentions above into actions."
9763,school should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? use reasons and examples to support your answer.,"It is unquestionable that everybody wants to get teach by professional teachers. There are several ways to evaluate the teacher's knowledge. One of these methods is to ask from student about their teachers. In my point of view, there have some flows in these methods. These flows include; students are not objective and teachers will be depend on students. Ċ Firstly, students are biased while evaluating their teachers. It is not secret that the relationship between students and teachers is not always normal. There can be some disappointing moments such as students may hate his/ her teacher. Specially, if we are talking about the school. Subsequently, while evaluating their teachers, those students will be biased. Adversely, student may have good relationship with teacher and thus he/she will be convinced to give good mark to that teacher even though that teacher may have some lack of knowledge. Consequently, the assessment will be wrong. Ċ Moreover, teachers will depend on students. After knowing that students play a role in his/her career the teachers will inclined to approach to students more softly. Because, any misunderstanding by student may lead to the career failure. Accordingly, the teachers try to build good relationship with students rather than teaching them properly. Therefore, the level of education will be dramatically decreased. Ċ Additionally, students are not able to estimate their teacher's knowledge because, they know less than their teacher and it require more effort to organize the assessment system by students. Ċ Finally, taking into consideration above mentioned reasons we can conclude it is absolutely wrong to student to evaluate teacher's knowledge. The teacher should be as independent as possible."
9764,"Some people believe famous people's support towards international aid organizations draws attention to problems, while others think celebrities make the problems less important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The call for raising international funding from famous celebrities has become a widespread phenomenon towards the advertisement. More often, they actively call for help with social poverty and needle people. Some people tend to assert that their support towards non-profit organisations plays an important role in dealing with issues. However, there are also many people who firmly advocate that the occurrence of celebrities reduce the importance of problems. It is quite understandable that views on this issue vary from person to person. Ċ Those people who strongly believe that the support from famous people is beneficial to social affairs have cogent reasons for it. Firstly, the promotion from celebrities serves as a good role model for their fans. For example, people would be more concerned about the poverty issue with South Africa's rural children if their favourite people call for attention. Secondly, their considerable financial support to the international aid organisations could be a good starting point to improve social issues such as disable and autistic children. People would start to donate to it no matter if it is less or more. Thus, this movement would bring a positive effect on the social atmosphere. Ċ In spite of the above arguments, I support the view that the help of a noted person would undermine the significance of problems. International charity activities might become tools to strengthen celebrities’ images. Some of them might take advantage of it to generate more popularity. For this reason, the social issue itself would not be the focused point for the general public to support but their celebrities or the businessman. Many marathon races, for instance, use the title of supporting disabled people to raise the fund by inviting some famous individuals. In this sense, charity support from them might be a surface of a kind-hearted illusion toward the camera. Ċ To sum up, we cannot deny that both sides are well-grounded. For my part, I completely agree with the latter view that the call-for-attention activity from famous people might ignore the essence of social problems."
9765,"For a century, there has been taught in reading, writing and maths. With the given of computer technology, some people think that there would be fourth skill which should be taught as beneficial skill for children as school: computer skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Just decades ago, literacy and numberacy play a vital role in the early stage of teaching for children. Nowadays, under the outbreak of the digital revolution, some people agrue that computer skills become beneficial skill for preschoolers. I completely agree with this view. Ċ There are important reasons why teaching children using the computer are essential. Firstly, being able to learn on a computer has opened up new ways for preschoolers to develop academically, especially those who struggle with a learning disorder. Countless website are created, which offer reading and math interventions for students with specific disabilities. Whereas, it take teachers long hours to find a method to help hard-to-reach children, the computer provides ready-man activities and interactive games to imtermediate use. A good example for this is Window eyes, which allows transfer text, numbers,... on the desktop to braiile using for the blind. Ċ On the other hand, it is a great benefit for children to study about other countries, their people and their culture enviroment, it is instills in them sense of comunication and tolerance. Because of computers and the Internet, our world is closely linked more than it has ever been in another century. Children are not only able to access to multi culture and countries, but they completely talk to friends in beyond the boundary by helpful tools namely: facebook, email, skype... For instance, children can also use computers to communicate with members of their extended family, and in case a move, kids can keep in touch with their old friends. Ċ In conclusion, I would agrue that computer skills become the fourth skill should be taught as beneficial skill for kids in preschool."
9766,some people say that the life of cities is becoming more stressful and has no advantage whereas others oppose to it. to what extent do you agree or disagree,"Different strokes for different folks. In this era, it is irrefutable fact that humankind has increased tremendously and the current era is enriched with multifarious large cities. It is undeniable that life in metropolitan areas is burdensome. I strongly agree with this statement but I disagree that living in a town has no positives. This essay shall intend to delve into this view and will elaborate on my perspective in the upcoming paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, surviving in big cities has its challenges. Firstly, it is very expensive to live in a city. This is mainly because everyone has to pay a tax, electricity bills, water bills and so on. Furthermore, people have to buy their own private vehicles for migrating because travelling in a cosmopolitan area is an arduous task. Consequently, in order to reach their destination in time, folks have to face many challenges such as traffic congestion, inadequate infrastructure etc. For example, a recent survey at Oxford University revealed that 90 % of the communities that dwell in an urban area are suffering from perilous diseases such as hypertension, depression and so on. Ċ However, there are numerous advantages. First of all, youngsters can find a suitable job effortlessly and can be able to learn lucrative salaries. As a result of this, they have a lot of opportunities to not only enhance their knowledge but also to change their lifestyle. Furthermore, it is rather easy to find a hospital in a city than in a remote area where individuals have to travel a lot to cure their illness. For instance, research at Cambridge college, London shows that facilities provided either by the government or by the private sectors in an urban field are 100 times more as compared to countryside areas. Ċ To summarize, even though city living causes stress and anxiety, it has its benefits. I strongly opine that staying in a town should be preserved as well as accelerated, so as to promote the zeal of heaps of opportunities. It is recommended that this should be followed in an organized way so that everyone would have access to it."
9767,Some people suggest that children do not understand the world of work and schools should make all teenager spend a short time working as well as studying academic subjects. To what extent do you agree?,"In modern days, it is believed that children are not exposed much to the world of jobs. Although others think that schools should encourage their students doing part-time jobs when going to school, I partly disagree with the statement. Ċ To start with, students who do out-of-school jobs would become overwhelmed. The amount of workload could give rise to less concentration on class or sleep deprivation, hence the bad scores the students get. Accordingly, there would also be fewer job prospects in the future due to the lack of knowledge they acquired. For instance, children in rural areas of Vietnam who work in the early stage of their lives have no educational qualifications and are more likely to become reluctant physical workers in the future, who put a lot of effort but have very low income. Ċ On the other hand, this could allow the students to have better work experienceSuggestiona better work experience. The teenagers who are used to working early would be more advantageous later on in their jobs. This is because they were so familiar with the tasks given in the past or they have some fundamental foundation of the future occupation. For example, one case in point is Bill Gates, who used to employ as a computer programmer when he was in secondary schools. By mastering many prompts in the past, he and his colleagues have created the well-known Microsoft company which makes millions of dollars per annum. Ċ In conclusion, despite the job experience, early part-time jobs would increase the workload for students, thereby reducing the effectiveness when studying. I believe that a student's performance is much more crucial than acquiring work experience and therefore, I partly disagree with the statement."
9768,"At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support.","Universities and colleges play significant role in students' life. These educational institutes not only provide educational facilities like classes and libraries, but must improve students' abilities in social and sports fields. In my opinion, it is their responsibility to support financially non-educational aspects as well as educational aspects. Ċ First, nowadays an all-rounder person has great status in society. Students must be learn their own fields sufficiently, also foster their social skills, Athletic abilities and etc. all these competences make them take up a good job and are satisfied in their lives. For example, a successful manager is a person who is able to have doing well social interactions and ability for dealing with difficulties; these are proficiency that come from his experiences in real life. In contract, a manager that just studies management and does not have any social activity fails to obtain a good situation as a career. Ċ Second, there is a Persian idiom that says"" a well mind is in a healthy body."" A good sport activity plan is necessary for students. They must contribute in sport activities, compete with each other, have a happy time and become more familiar with together. It is clear that in a solid and strict atmosphere like universities and colleges, a recreation plan such as sport activities, make a good balance for students. For instance, a student who is good in track and field learns to be more resistant and agile in studying than a student just peruses educational goals and does not pay attention to his physical activities. Ċ Finally, it can be said that every society needs person who is well brought up his genius, has different abilities to deal with problems in his career and also in his life. Universities and colleges with providing opportunities for improving young people's abilities in all fields, take an important step."
9769,"Health care should not be provided for free regardless of a person’s income. The health of a person is in their own hands and they should, therefore, be held accountable for that. Ċ Do you agree with this statement?","In some developed countries, there is a trend of costless healthcare benefits, regardless of the person’s income. I believe that there are some cases where this free medical care facility is disadvantageous to the general public, however, in other aspects it is quite acceptable. Firstly, I will explain how it has negative effects on society, and secondly, the positive side of this scheme will be examined. Ċ On one hand, this policy of free health services creates a negative stigma in society, as well as, increases the cost of living. To further explain, not charging for the medical treatments has a wrong impact on the public as they least bother about their well-being. Also, funds allocated to the healthcare system by the administration is a part of the money paid by tax-payers towards the government, and this puts the burden on the mass. For example, as dental care is free in our country, fewer people are interested in maintaining dental health to avoid consulting dentists. Ċ On the other hand, there are various viral diseases which are inevitable despite being health conscious, and in that scenario, a person should enjoy the benefits of these schemes. In addition, people are not reluctant in getting medical attention if provided free, and this helps in alleviating the spread of communicable illnesses. For instance, coronavirus started engulfing the whole world, and due to the free medical facilities provided by the nation, people cooperated with governing bodies to control it. Ċ To conclude, free medical attention brings the carelessness in the society, moreover, it leads to the rising expenditures. In contrast, this policy has a strong advantage of letting people come Infront to restrict the spread of some viral sicknesses."
9770,Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons. Ċ The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today. Ċ Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today. Ċ The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace. Ċ In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned."
9771,Nowadays many people work part or full time from home. Some people say that working from home has many benefits while others disagree. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion,"A Workplace is a crucial part of our life.A number of individuals claim it would be better if employees work by commuting from home. However, others believe it is not effective. I believe to work from home is more convenient that that of from others. Ċ There are various reasons as to why some people hold the assumption that those who commute from home to office for job have great conveniences. Firstly, they can reside with their families, which will lead them to obtain affection of parents as well as siblings. In addition to it, if they are married, they can monitor their children to forbear them from indecent friends. As a result, working from dwelling house will provide a significant feedback which, perhaps, they will not attain if they do not it. For example, in Sydney, it is the government rule that every officer has to inhabit his family, even it is too far from the office. Ċ On the other hand, employing from native place has a few considerable perils. The prime drawbacks can be that officials who will commute from home will require significant time to arrive at the office because of traffic stalemate. Furthermore, they will entail ample currency for apartment rent, hostel expenditure that for some will hardly be feasible to bear. For instance, in India, a couple of years ago, most government officials had to stand proximate to their workplaces. Afterwards, the employees faced an immense shortage of money as they had to pay house rent. Ċ To conclude, to employ from dwelling place has both positive and negative sides. In my opinion, to commute from the house to the office is more advantageous, although a few problems are visible."
9772,"international tourism is harmful? Many countries believe that international tourism has harmful effects, why do they think so? What can be done to change their views?","Nowadays, it is quite simple for people to travel to other countries. However, debates have yielded a spectrum of views. Some countries do not consider prosperous tourism industry as a positive development. In this essay, I am going to explain the reasons and provide some solutions for it. Ċ First and foremost, the major rationale of denying the tourism for some specific countries is that it might interrupt the original lives of residents in local areas. Since controlling the qualities and numbers of foreigners is quite difficult, the entry of myriad travelers without having the essential respect towards the religion and customs could disgust local citizens. Also, the visit of travelers at some vulnerable environment like natural national park, as a consequence, could cause the tremendous catastrophe such as the destruction of other creatures's habitats. Ċ Therefore, that's why some countries do not like too many outlanders come to their continents. However, I reckon that there are still some ways that can make them comprehend the advantage of welcoming foreign people. Firstly, analyzing the profit which travel industry can contribute to those countries' economy is one effective solution. If the governments realize how considerable amount of money they can earn from the travelers, they would agree to develop this industry. Moreover, governmental institutions can encourage residents to communicate with people from other countries, too. With this action, the society can become more open and dynamic. Last but not least, it is possible to persuade citizens that advertisements and relevant restrictions on the behavior of foreigners can predominantly diminish their negative influences. Ċ In a nutshell, although for some reasons, some countries do not have positive reputation on tourism, some solutions can still be applied to change their belief."
9773,"1.Today, lots of people have their own computer and a telephone, which made it easy for Ċ people to do job at their home. Does working at home have more advantages or more disadvantages?","Undoubtedly, it is widely held that work from home has become easier due to the increasing ownership of electrical gadgets in today's modern era. This trend can cause damage along with advantageousness. I believe the pitfalls here trump the boons; notwithstanding, following disquisition delves into both outlooks in details. Ċ Apparently, the main fundamental plus points of such tendency could be saving of time, in terms of travelling. It is evident that if individuals are employed from the house, there is no need to worry about daily commute back and forth, which could waste the longer hours, otherwise. Additionally, persons can look after their toddlers at the house by keeping eye on them, or by dropping up and picking up them to and from school. Obviously, this kind of job is not possible by being at the workplace. For example, one viral video of a professor in a current coronavirus lockdown situation, who teaches her students via online classes and able to care for her own offspring. Ċ Conversely, are there any negative sides of alike tendency? Certainly, it follows that the major hurdle of working from home is a lack of professional help. In detail, when an employee works under a professional setup with a group, it is extremely easy to communicate with everyone; consequently, the stumbling blocks or issues can be resolved quickly. However, it is not the case in working from home. Moreover, the dedication level of people can be dwindled down as they do not face their employers face-to-face. Therefore, chances of poor performance and less productivity are always there. An article by GNA (Guardian Newspaper of America), for instance, mentioned that the government of the USA is expecting to resume all businesses in person by the end of July as the country has been facing a muddle of low productivity in many sectors for one year. Ċ To conclude, having explored both standpoints, it is absolute that because of possessing of technological gadgets job by being at house could be possible; nonetheless, the downtrends of the given mandate like low productivity and less supervision supersede the benefits like time efficiency and taking care of children."
9774,it is unrealistic to work for only one company for your whole life => agree or disagree doing the same job permanently,"Job decision is one of the most important decisions we make in our lives. Some people wish to have a permanent job and work under same company for their whole lives. Others just love to experience different positions in different places because they are fond of changes. Although I believe that changing job is an interesting idea, working for only one company year years is certainly not unrealistic. Ċ Firstly, it would be more secured if you do not change your job often. Nowadays, thousands of people lose their jobs or cannot find one. If you give up your current job without having got accepted to work for another company, you would probably bear the risk of being unemployed. In case that you have successful applied for a new job, it is still not certain that you could work well and adapt to the new environment. Therefore, lots of people are working under only one company in their lives because it is a safe option. Ċ Secondly, a number of companies adapt the seniority system, which means that they have special treatment for long term employees. For example, a higher rate of pension, higher salary or promotion every few years... In general, you will be given more advantages if you have more time working for the company. This type of reward is widely used in Asian countries, such as Japan, Korea. In Japan, people do not have the tendency to work for different companies because it is hard to find a job, and the benefit of seniority system is really significant. Ċ To look at the problem with a different perspective, one of the greatest disadvantages of working permanently in the same company is definitely boredom. After all, all decision is a trade-off. If you are looking for a long-term job, boredom is inevitable. If you always seek for opportunities to learn different things, do not hesitate to change."
9775,Some people believe that there should be a law which prevents young people under the age of 18 being outside after midnight. Do you agree or disagree?,"Indeed, spending time out of home at midnight has been often ever increasingly popular activity among youngsters. While some argue that the government should enact stringent laws against such teenagers to prevent them from going outside, I, however, agree with this view for two reasons. Ċ One reason in terms of subsiding adults is to get involved in a bad habit. It is undeniable if offspring gets the liberty to go outside at midnight, they tend to be inevitably get trapped in bad habits such as drugs, smoking, gambling, and so on. As a result, they seem to be addicted to harmful habits. Similarly, gradually they drift apart from their family members and quit their ambitions in the middle, which results in ruin their whole life. In contrast, if the government imposes strict laws it can have an influential impact on teenagers and they will deter to fall into bad habits. Ċ Another reason for preventing young people is it restricts them from being a victim of crime. Nowadays, many youngsters like to go to clubs, discos for hanging out with friends and having parties, which is prevalent. Nevertheless, usually, after having alcohol drinks they seem to misbehave or molest girls. Consequently, they have to suffer imprisonment and their families also have to tolerate for such misbehaves. For instance, a survey conducted by the Times of India found that 63% of adults who generally go outside rather being at home are inclined to be a victim of crime. Ċ In conclusion, not only does teenager drift away from their motivation in life due to failing in bad habits, but also can be a victim of a crime for which they have to pay the exorbitant cost of their life. Therefore, I agree that the government should impose strict legislation to restrict youngsters from going outside."
9776,"Alternative energy sources that use the natural power of wind, waves and sun are too expensive and complicated to replace the coal, oil and gas that we use to power our cities and transport. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this option?","The demand for powering the town and transportation has increased for years. For this reason, a wide range of domestic solar system does not generate sufficient energy to meet all needs. Other resources such as harnessing natural power of the sun, waves and wind are preparing by countries. However, it cost a huge amount of money for purchasing the apparatus such as the machine and power station. Also, installing the tools require an enormous attempt and complicated. For another country in which the panels have been implemented, providing energy alternative sources could be tackled swiftly. Ċ Constructing the alternative energy plant requires an amount of founding at which the state should allocate outweigh. In Canada, $120 million should be in charge of government for providing the equipment and installing the apparatus which are needed. Furthermore, the scientists have to struggle and concerted effort on creating the wave solar panel as it is complicated. Take Portland as an example in which they was fail in order to build wave plant. When they performed to build the wave plant, the equipment quickly sank. Ċ Conversely, harnessing wind turbine to power the cities for some countries is not difficult as they succeed to install it. For example, China is one of the countries where wind solar panels have worked. For years, the panels could generate an amount of electricity in order to meet the energy needed by the cities and transportation. As the plants have worked in China, creating waves energy is not be the problem. Ċ The aforementioned evidence reveals that although constructing the alternative energy requires huge attempt and too expensive, some other countries could install it. Where possible, the state should be in charge of maintenance the plants."
9777,"Topic: In cities, large shopping center and supermarket become more popular than small local shop. Is this positive or negative development. Those desirable modern shopping centers..","In recent years, the appearance of modern shopping areas such as big commercial centers and supermarkets in the cities is more popular than small local shops. While I accept that this may be a positive development, I believe that it is also a negative one. Ċ On the one hand, there are several reasons why this trend is beneficial in some ways. Firstly, local residents will find it easier to buy some kinds of essential things like food and household items in big-scale shopping buildings instead of going to more than one location. There is definitely a variety of products in a similar commercial complex, which is what most citizens expect these days to save their own times. Secondly, some small stores sell their products such as fruits and drinks without verified origins which is forced in either each shop of shopping complex or supermarket. If any object is bought in the supermarket, its quality will be guaranteed. Ċ On the other hand, this development can be extremely negative. One reason is that the business of local employers will be affected because of the competition between them and the owners of commercial buildings. This will bring about a considerable decrease of local income, which may lead a part of the locals unable to make ends meet. Furthermore, the excessive growth of such large shopping areas can lead to the shortage of space for public usage. As a result, the local inhabitants will have less place to do physical activities like sports and morning exercises. Ċ In conclusion, it is certainly true that these modern shopping buildings should be more popular, but this is by no means that these places will be excessively developed."
9778,Some people think spending a lot on birthdays and marriage celebrations is a waste of money but others think it is important to the young people and the society.Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Whether or not to spend the money on special life events, such as birthdays and marriages has become a controversial issue.While some individuals that it is a mere wastage of wealth, others think it is significant to spend on these occasions.This essay intends to delve into both sides of the argument in depth.I, however, opine that a balanced approach should be adopted. Ċ To begin with, the advocates of the statement claim that celebrating vital moments of the life has its advantages for the individual and society. Since most of the youth is greatly influenced by the global culture, therefore these celebrations help them to revive their own traditions and cultures and prevent them from forgetting the auspicious customs.For instance, in my country, India, weddings are celebrated with great pomp and show in the presence of all relatives and friends.Thus, certain occasions should be organised so that cultural values may not be lost. Ċ On the other hand, the opponents of the perspective argue that extravagant expenditure on these occasions is not justified regardless of its usefulness. Because sometimes in order to please the affluent people, an individual might suffer from excessive debt, which in turn, ultimately enhances stress level.If a person feels under depression, his life and family will eventually be a great sufferer.To cite an example, it has become common in some countries, such as, India to ask for dowry at the time of marriage of a girl child.As a result, in order to fulfil the desire of the groom's family, parents of the bride often take money on the interest rate.Although I certainly agree that the expenditure on celebration of these events revive old rituals, overspending is inappropriate. Ċ To conclude, undeniably, society is divided on the way of spending their wealth on the memorable moments.Some consider it as appropriate, whereas others opine that it should not be wasted.Despite distinct opinions I am in favour of using it in a wise manner so that its adverse effects can be avoided."
9779,The range and quanlity of food that we can buy has changed because of technological and scientific advances. Some people regard this change as an improvement while other believe that it is harmful. Discuss both view and give opinions.,"Opinions differ on whether technological advances in food production are benefical or not. I believe that on the whole the advances do not benefit the health and the public. Ċ On the one hand, it is an undeniable fact that technological and scientific advanced has certainly brought some positives. Firstly, almost famers can produce crops that grow bigger and faster as well as modifying crops to be more resistant to disease or insects. The result is that the faster growing cereals, the more profit farmers obtain from fruits and vegetables. Secondly, foods can be processed to look perfect and last longer by using preservative and spectacular packings. Consequently, they may be more attractive to customers. Ċ On the other hand, this development could be more detrimental in terms of environment and health. For example, farming with fertilizers and pesticides is more and more enviromently unfriendly, even causes pollution in air, water and land. Another negative point is that many people now distrust foods that have been modified and processed, they tend to profer organic foods which are produced without chemicals. The most obvious explanation is that there may be risks resulting in serious health problem, such as food poisoning or long-term effects from the genetic enfineering of foods. Ċ In conclusion, there are convincing arguments both for and against advances in food technology, but I believe that this change is far more harmful to health and environment."
9780,Governments should spend money on railways rather than roads. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? more support for train or for car industry?,"Nowsday transportation also is more of important government job. So will increasing different option for government to choose which one is more necessary. Ċ And some of people think railways other people think is roads. Transport will bring the people convenience and effect. In my opinion is railways more important than roads, that have some reason: Ċ First of all, Recently we can see have own vehicle people more and more, when drive to work or travel is convenience but at the same time easy cause the traffic congestion. Secondly, during traffic congestion vehicle still working so emission increasing air pollution easy get people sick or feeling uncomfortable. Thirdly when thousand of cars driving will make noisy. Ċ In the other hand, The government improve the railways can enhance the people during traffic effect and at the same time reducing the traffic congestion because it is the public transport. Secondly reduce the noise and car accident happen chance, more  convenience  and improve quality of life for living in the side road people. Thirdly reduce air pollution and improve air quality of life also can help tourism come to your country to travel and can easy arrange their time to play. Ċ On consunded, government should spend more money on railways more than roads, because railways sell the ticket also is good way can drawback of money, and reuse the money to build up another basic construciton, improve our convenience of life and reduce air pollution, noise, traffic congestion and save money form privacy vehicle."
9781,Today’s teenagers have more stressful lives than previous generations. Discuss this view and give your own opinion.,"In the modern world, many people live throughout the stress and such tendency can not be joyful. Adolescents, in fact, are affected by adults who pressurize them so life becomes complicated. From my point of view, it is true, but some do not want to believe in it. Ċ Firstly, the era of technologies has come and as a result internet, social media, networking sites have a significant influence on the psyche of any person. However, teenagers are most susceptible to it. The researches demonstrate, that youth starts to be ashamed of themselves looking for instance at perfect photos of stunning models, the wealth of famous people or achievements of others. In addition, a mental disorder is a dangerous issue that can lead to unpleasant consequences. Ċ Secondly, education systems changed for the worse more than for the better. A program became more saturated and despite it gives more knowledge, it also causes stress to students. Schools load children with tons of homework and there is no time left to spend with family and friends. For example, pupils can spend nights preparing for tests or exams to have excellent marks. Consequently, they have a lack of sleep and may not even eat during the day. Ċ To sum up, nowadays lives are definitely tense and one of the reasons is the pace of life. A big amount of people chasing a dream, get into a kind of competition and forget to rest. Awareness of what you are doing will help you to obtain success but only if you are able to cope with stress."
9782,Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is argued that technological advancements in the field of conversation have adversely affected one's personal and professional relationships. Personally, I strongly disagree with this view. Ċ As new ways of communicating with one another, such as mobile phones and social networks, are introduced, some fear that people might become socially isolated. Their rationale is that these technologies, which promote communication in virtual reality, have marginalized physical interaction and thus may potentially fracture concrete relationships. However, this claim is largely exaggerated. In reality, virtual interaction augments social relationships rather than undermines them. For example, most Facebook users talk to friends and colleagues both through the social network and in person. The extra features that Facebook provides like instant messaging and video calling do not substitute for having a conversation in real life, but merely help us stay connected over long distances. Ċ I am convinced there is further evidence to suggest that innovations in communication exist not to the detriment of social relationships, but rather to their benefit. Not only do they address the question of distance as demonstrated above, these tools also help us to expand our social circles. For instance, online food forums connect people who share a passion for culinary arts, while photo-sharing applications like Instalgram can bring together a group of individuals who have the same taste in fashion. These examples are a testament to how technology establishes communities and promotes interaction among people. Ċ In conclusion, there are sufficient grounds to reject the view that social relationships might be jeopardized by the advent of advanced communication technologies. It is my genuine belief that as technology improves going forward, so will people's social experience."
9783,"Some people belive that a crime is a result of social problems and poverty, others think that crime is a result of a bad's person nature. discuss both views and give your opinion.","Every nation from all around the globe suffers from crimes, aggressions and insecurity. Numerous persons believe that this scourge is caused by social issues and poverty, others assert that it is due to the bad nature of criminals. Personally, I firmly believe that this crisis is a result of social inequalities. This essay will discuss both of the aforementioned views. Ċ First and foremost, it is crystal clear that crimes and poverty are pegged. Indeed, people with no degree can hardly access jobs nowadays, to exacerbate this, schools and universities are simply unaffordable for the poorest, then those people find themselves in a vicious circle with no escape. Consequently, impoverished persons got no solution but to steal in order to survive. To illustrate this matter of fact, we should remember that prisons are full of illiterate people. Ċ On the other hand, it is arguable that the negative nature of criminals pushes them to commit felonies. Bad-witted civilians will commit infractions no matter how rich they are, and this may be due to the education they received during their childhood, or the environment they used to live in. For example, Jordan Belfort used to be a successful trader, however, he stole money from his friends only to grow his own fortune, even though he was already very rich. Ċ To sum up, from my perspective, I espouse the idea that crimes are mainly the consequence of social inequalities. It is the onus of the government to palliate this issue, with free loans for education for example."
9784,"Many things can influence the academic achievement and emotional growth of a student. In this regard, peers have more of an impact than teachers do. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","Many people believe that schoolmates have a more significant effect on an individual's academic performance and emotional development than teachers. In my view, I believe that while classmates are more impactful as an academic motivation, educators serve as a more righteous guide to student's emotional maturity. Ċ To begin with, students are proved to be more motivated when performing under peer pressure. As an example, there is a ranking system between class members and there are academic championships around the school year to help elicit competition from the desire to outperform others to be at the highest position. If with healthy practice, these stimulations can push learners forward in the academic race, with the determination to showcase their ability to impress their friends. Therefore, in this case, peer rivalry definitely brings about a greater effect on an individual’s success in the classroom than pedagogical efforts. Ċ However, at the same time, schoolteachers can provide emotional orientation for students, especially when life issues or conflicts arise. Young learners are often prone to emotional dilemma due to the lack of experience in life. Consequently, the seniors, as mature adults with lengthier lifetime, can give them a hand with profound solutions, or provide mental support to back them up from the difficulties they might be facing. The advice from teachers, in this regard, would certainly be more helpful and influential than from peers, who might have not seen enough in life to come up with the best measures. Ċ In conclusion, I partly disagree with this statement, as teachers and friends affect each individual on different aspects and they are of the same weight to a student's personal development. While peer competition can be an impulse to students’ academic accomplishment, support from a teacher, can be more efficacious to their sentimental well-being."
9785,"Some people believe that entertainers are paid too much and their impact on the society is negative, while others disagree and believe that they deserve the money they make because of their positive effect on others. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Celebrities have been major influences for a long time and their income has often been a debated subject. While some argue that they badly affect our community and should be paid less, others think that they are fairly paid because of their positive aspect. Both views will be discussed in before a conclusion is reached. Ċ To begin with, every type of industry either it can be acting, playing or hospitality job is different and valuable. For instance, talking about the amount of money that is paid to entertainers, these people rigorously perform harder tasks each day to master their skills and to amuse people. They play for the nation and represent it in the world. To illustrate this, Australian cricket team gives its fullest to win the game at national as well as international level, to raise the name of their country. Therefore, it cannot be said that these jobs do not deserve the perks. However, sometimes these celebrities enrol in controversy which could defame a country prestige. Ċ On the other hand, it is undeniable that jobs like doctors, teachers or community workers are paid considerably less as compared to entertaining professions. For example, the doctors put in at least ten years of gruelling study, and they save lives. Whereas, teachers educate and inspire young people to be a responsible citizen, for the economic progression educators produce better leaders. Moreover, social workers rescue individuals facing not only physical, but also psychological challenges, their intervention lead to a safer society. Ċ To sum up, every profession has its own value and everyone deserves the best. I tend to believe that, although artists entertain us, but instead of paying them excessive incentives, all the profession ought to be equally valued."
9786,IELTS WRITING TASK 2: Some people think that it is so difficult for poor people or people from rural areas to go to university so that the university should make it espescially easy to them. Do you agree or disagree ? attend university by less privileged people,"Many people believe that it is too challenging for underprivileged people or people from rural regions to attend university, and therefore university ought to provide favourable condition to study for them. To a certain extent, I agree with this view, while I also believe that there is an argument to disagree with it. Ċ On the one hand, this opinion seems to be unreasonable simply because this situation could make the admission of unfair for students. In general, poor students or students from rural areas would have lower performance than those who have a wealthy background or live in cities. Thus, good students would be not able to attend university because of making way for poor students or those who live in the countryside. Ċ In spite of the arguments above, I also argue against this view for the following reasons. To commence with helping poor people to escape from poverty. In evidence, the university will provide advanced knowledge and practical skills like teamwork, presentation, problem-solving for them. Consequently, the underprivileged students would not only become well-prepared for labour market but also be able to find stable employment in the future. Equally important is that this solution would develop social and economic growth in rural areas. Take my country as an example, where the student would be adopted by universities from the received scholarship of the government with the commitment that returns work homeland. Therefore, this would improve the quality of labour in the countryside that is the foundation to develop the economy and society in the country. Ċ In conclusion, although I recognize possible arguments to accept this view, there are also persuasive reasons to believe that this idea is unreasonable."
9787,"In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology(IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?","There is no doubt that information technology has been developed significantly from the last two decades. So, information and communication can be easily done through World Wide Web or by email. Some argue that future developments in IT are likely to have more negative than positive while others think it in converse. Ċ I think the problem is somewhat controversial as it has both negative and positive effects. However will we receive a lot of information, including the latest news on internet, we will not be able to know whether the news is right or wrong. Some may be rumours and will make most people believe. Sometimes this may lead to political and economical changes. Especially changes in economy may make goods in higher prices. If so, internet will be a target for some businessmen. Ċ Moreover, face-to-face contact will be reduced as communication will be quite easier. As a result, respective behaviours of people may become less. Most people are unlikely to visit friends' or relatives' homes and might think of themselves it is not important even if happy or sad occasions occur. Although some are friends on the web, they might not be able to know what to say when they have to contact face-to-face. Ċ The serious one is that developments in IT are likely to make debatable problems. It is true that we will be able to discuss many topics more easily. Nonetheless, there may be a dispute in discussing political views. If it becomes more serious, it may lead to a war. Ċ Although negative effects always come along with positive ones, many negative and few positive effects is not a good one. But one true thing is that there will be still developments in IT in the future."
9788,Many people try to look younger than they really are. What are the reasons for that? Is it a positive or negative development? people desire to look young,"Nowadays, there are a larger number of people desiring to look young for their age because of different reasons. In my opinion, the trend is negative and people should not persure that development. Ċ First of all, people usually need many resources such as time and money in order to be a youthful people than the actual age. There are many beauty methods can make people are more beautiful and younger such as making up, massaging which are time-consuming to do. For example, since, many women spend much time on making up before going out, they might go to meetings, dating late. In addition, people usually take big money for beauty methods to have a younger looking and more appealing. The fact that the cost of a cosmetic surgery and high-tech beauty devices are ordinarily out of touc h with people who have a low or medium income. Ċ One of the other drawbacks is that there are a larger amount of bad effects on health when people attempt to have a pretty and youthful imagine by unnatural approaches. Some beauty products which are bad quality can have unwanted effects when people apply them on skin, hair. In fact, in some bad situations, people might come out in a rash on their body or even catch a skin cancer if they use that products in a long time. Furthermore, cosmetic surgeries as cheek lift, breast lift can carry potential risks. People have higher risk of developing complications such as heart attack, lung cancer, pneumonia, stroke and shorten their life span. Ċ In conclusion, to look younger can make people be more confident with their body imagine. However, the disadvantages of beauty methods are extremely serious therefore people should not overuse them."
9789,Being a celebrity – such as a movie star or professional athlete – brings problems as well as benefits. Ċ Do you think that being a celebrity has more benefits or drawbacks?,"In this contemporary world, everyone has to be famous at once in their life. In the case of celebrities, some of them might think that it itself creates issues as well as goods things, in which both sides has its own brighter side and darker side. This essay shows how the brighter side of famous people affects their life. Ċ Firstly, in the case of film actors, they could get a high paid salary because of their popularity among society which might help them to live in luxury growth altogether. For example, famous actors buy new branded luxury cars, clothing or accessories which would create a higher position in the community. When there is an important function lead by any famous company would call them to come and made them a special guest. Thus, they would get a high ranking in society. Ċ Additionally, more people would recognise when they went to a place and asked for the autograph which could help them to be famous in their career. To be a successful professional, they have to create a fans association by bringing good hearts together. For instance, many actors have their own fan club in which if they want anything to get ready, they would always there for them. Hence, celebrity lifetime was an enjoyable period that could recognise them in their whole lifespan. Ċ In conclusion, in my opinion, famous people get an ideal part of getting and knowing by the people around them. So being a famous person is good to compare to the common people."
9790,There are many people who go to live in different countries. To what extent should people be allowed to move freely between countries and live where they choose? What are the benefits and drawbacks of this? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is needless to say that people are emigrating to different countries for enhanced opportunities. I believe that not only migrants, but also a host nation harness the benefits of migration. In spite of a few disadvantages, it offers numerous advantages. Let's dig deeper into this issue in this essay. Ċ At the onset, increasingly people are moving to other nations, owing to both fantastic opportunities and preferable livelihood; hence, migration is inevitable. Moreover, freedom is a fundamental right of a citizen; therefore, they must be allowed to select the land they want to reside. Besides, at some place people earn their living merely because of tourism; as a result, it must be underpinned by the authorities. If the international movement becomes easy, the employment of tourist places will increase. For instance, according to The Times newspaper, Canada has eased the immigration laws to alleviate the threat of an unavoidable decline in the workforce. Ċ Without any qualms, there are multitude pros and cons of this movement across the borders. Looking at upside, it enables different countries to increase their economy. Perennially, it enables a country to promote globalization, which is an imperative tool for the growth of the global economy. At the opposite end of the spectrum, it has proved to be a major setback to the developing nations, as their citizens are moving overseas in order to live amazing lives. Consequently, it is being considered as a workforce loss by some nations. What is more, sceptics have been arguing that migrants rip-off the rights of indigenous people. To illustrate, in the United States of America, there has been a great hue and cry to curtail the immigration as they believe that immigrants are bagging better opportunities. Ċ To conclude, migration is a double-edged sword. Beyond doubt, The international movement of people leads to many detrimental effects in both the native and the host countries. However, an additional support to the economy together with the elevated globalisation has made it a necessary evil. Thus, people must be allowed to travel across the boundaries of nations."
9791,"Rising university fees and scarce employment prospects for graduates have led some people to say that universities should not teach arts subjects, like philosophy and Ċ history, and only offer practical degree courses that maximise chances of employment. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the modern life, there has been an increase in tuition fees and more narrow job opportunities for graduates resulting in an opinion asserting that universities no longer need to include arts subjects into their curricula, such as philosophy or history. Instead, they should pay sole attention to providing substantive courses which could broaden career prospects. Although I concur that practical subjects are indispensable in universities nowadays, I personally find non-academic disciplines are also worth a place in this tertiary education. Ċ In the first place, it is of paramount importance of the provision of real-world experience subjects at universities. First and foremost, with regards to individuals, university graduates would be equipped with not only fundamental but also necessary knowledge that is practicable in real-life situations, particularly in the working environments. Hence, it is likely advantageous for them in terms of securing brighter career paths as in this era, employers have a tendency of seeking qualified candidates having obtained sufficient background insight at universities. Secondly, a larger number of productive workers would be introduced into the current labour force thanks to the proper integration of these practical disciplines at colleges. In other words, from the perspective of society, the overall productivity would likely be enhanced, consequently, boosting the economic situation of a specific nation. Ċ On the other hand, I firmly believe that art-based subjects are by no means excluded from the curricula of higher education. A noticeable merit of their existence is that, having studied these subjects, students might obtain a more profound comprehension about the underlying factors in society. For example, via philosophy course, university students could deepen their understanding about how political areas work through the ideologies of political predecessors. Another supporting case is that, history classes would provide them with historical background, for instance, of their nations and of their ancestors. With this knowledge, graduates, or on a larger scale, adolescents, would appreciate and show compassion for the sufferings and losses that previous generations had to bear. To sum up, all the art-related insights could sharpen the mentality of graduates, make them more knowledgeable and well-educated. Ċ In conclusion, I would argue that arts and practical subjects are of equal importance in universities no matter how expensive tuition fees may be and how high unemployment rate would be."
9792,Some people fail on their school but achieve success in their adult life. Why do you think this will happen? What causes/reasons may lead to a person's successful life?,"We know that Steve Jobs, Akio Morita and other famous people were same as other children as their performance on all lessons was not even good. It is so surprising that how they reached to outstanding success and become game changer in the world economy. There are some contributing factor that result to outstanding achievement in person's life. In this essay I will examine the importance of some characters that makes people leading role in their society. Ċ To begin with, one common character among those successful people is that deep interest in one special area rather than being successful in all lessons. When they become interested in one subject, they continue to develop that area further. For example, Akio Morita, who is a founder of Sony Corporation, was excellent at engineering courses but not in social lessons. As a result of it, overall performance seemed poor but that specialization leaded him to become magic person who created many technologies. Ċ Second, being creative is the most importance character brings us to successful life. It is a fact that children who are keen on to initiate something new, they are highly likely to become game changer when they reach a mature. Moreover, perseverance is an important factor of achievement where only person who never gives up to obstacle and stand up again after the failure reaches a top of their class. Ċ In the conclusion, I am convinced that common character found in famous and successful people is being creative and persevered. Also we need to emphasis a role of being specialized in one area that lead to outstanding achievement in our future life."
9793,"Most employers nowadays put increasing emphasis on social skills. Some people believe that cocial skills are important in addition to good qualifications for job success. Ċ To what extent, do you agree or disagree?","When it comes to hiring, Social skills have become one of the primary abilities required, but some people think it should be taken into account along with other qualifications. while it is vital to some extent, I agree with the statement because of the importance of other aspects. Ċ On the one hand, there are a few reasons why employers consider social skills more than before. Because of the advanced technologies, social media, and the internet, the amount of interaction has increased dramatically worldwide in the two last decades. This results in high demand for social capabilities that companies can compete on that scale Since customer service plays a crucial role in the competition. Recruiting employees are not exempt in this matter. Due to the fact that employers think that dealing more effectively with customers can gain a better financial income directly and indirectly. For example, with desirable knowledge of communication, clerks would probably satisfy the customers’ needs which is an essential factor in businesses. Ċ On the other hand, a variety of other capabilities should be considered by recruiters during a hiring process for optimum achievement. Many jobs do not require any social abilities as employees will not encounter any other people due to the conditions. Therefore, in this situation, other things such as experience, education or knowledge should become the key factor of considerations for workers. For instance, technicians or programmers would most likely need to interact with computers rather than people. Moreover, even a person, who has fabulous social abilities but no related experiences, will not perform efficiently to fulfil the task. Thus, companies have to evaluate all aspects to reach their maximum potential. Ċ In conclusion, social skills have become so important and should consider when hiring. In my perspective, although the amount of emphasis vary based on the condition of the job that companies do, other capabilities of individuals need to be assessed equally."
9794,"Question Students who go directly from school to university benefit less from, and contribute less to their courses than those who take a job or travel in order to get more experience in the real world before starting higher education. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this statement? Suspended for incorrect thread title. Answer","It has almost become a western tradition for students, who are about to commence the first year of university, to take a year off to either conduct first attempt in the workforce or fulfil the teenager dream-visit foreign countries and appreciate exotic culture. Although it is beneficial for students to gain working experience and explore the world, the drawbacks from this decision can outweigh merits. Ċ To some extent, it is true that real life experience trumps academic knowledge, because university education can only impart certain knowledge and technique, whereas real-life experiences , such as interpersonal skills, moral standards and social courtesy, can only be attained in the society. However, students should not ignore the disadvantages caused by taking a year off. Ċ For students who seek for working opportunities, they may overlook or underestimate their disadvantaged situation. As fresh graduates from high schools, students normally do not have professional skills and working experiences, which make them less competitive in the labour market. Therefore, it is unlikely for them to find promising jobs and most of them end up with low-end ""blue-collar"" jobs which can hardly provide any working experience. Ċ Many students start their journey with hopes to befriend with strangers, appreciate exotic cultures and deal with unexpected crisis, which can also be achieved in universities. Interestingly, university life can provide all the sensation that a young traveller crave-acquaint with new classmates, enjoy a long chat with international students and cope with assessments. On top of all, all this can be achieved with minimum cost and without falling behind their peers. Ċ Nevertheless, the experiences obtained from work and travel are valuable, but given the constrains posed upon students, it is better for them to start university study right after the high school graduation."
9795,Some people want to attend a small college. Other people think that it is better to attend a large university. Which type of school do you prefer?why?Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,"Deciding the type of university is also a big decision for students as choosing the wrong one could have unexpected dire consequences on them like on their grade. Some of the differences between a small school and a big school could be difference in the size of the classes, acceptance rate of the school and, sometimes bigger schools have better lab facilities and bigger library. In my opinion, going to a bigger school would be better than going to smaller school for various reasons Ċ Firstly, when I go to a bigger school the class hours would be more flexible as there would more classes taught in each course as it has more students which also means it is more probable that it has more options for class timings. Moreover, these classes are taught by different professors as bigger schools would have more professors. So, if could not understand one of the professors, I can simply drop that class and try for the same class taught by different professor. This would really help me in getting good grades. Ċ Secondly, the larger schools will generally have more majors available than in smaller schools which would really help me as I am undecided major and I can explore about different subjects and then pick up my major. In addition, as I already mentioned that larger schools will have better lab facilities which would give better hands on experience if pick up my major in the science or engineering department. Ċ Since I am also looking for a job, as larger school would have more facilities which in turn would mean that they have more jobs available than other university. Ċ Even though, a small school would have small classrooms, but the advantages of a large university will outweigh the advantages of a small university. These reasons drive me towards a larger university"
9796,"Some countries it is thought advisable that children begin formal education at four years old, while in others they do not have to start school until they are seven or eight.  How far do you agreed with either of these views?","As children are priceless asset, there has been a significant concern on their growth. The government in some countries established that children start to experience formal education at the age of four years. Meanwhile, others claim it is not worthwhile idea due to children's development. I utterly agree that they acquire valuable experiences when beginning at seven or eight years old. Ċ Bring children to formal institution at earlier age, less than five years old is not wise decision. People who accept this point out that children have not mature to deal with this condition, particularly psychologically. An educationalist of Adelaide University, K. Anderson, proclaimed that children aged four to six years old have their golden age. They will process instructions and information quickly. However, their psychology has not yet. There has been an evidence that two of ten children enrolled to elementary school at four of five age group suffer from serious headache. Unfortunately, it stands for long-term until those eneter senior high school. All in all, bringing children to school at such ages is dangerous for their growth. Ċ Countries which implement to enroll children to primary school at the age of seven consider numerous advantages obtained. Firstly, children's cognition have not reached optimal condition. They can acquire knowledge easily and effectively. Furthermore, their psychology has been well-developed. As a result, they can adapt easily with new environment and socialize with acquaintances. Ċ In conclusion, while children starting school at the age of four years can quickly master the lesson, they can suffer from serious health disease. It is better to introduce them with formal education at more mature phase, at aged sever to eight years. Therefore, parents should pay more attention in making decision related with their children's development."
9797,"The money spent on space research has brought enormous benefits to mankind, but it could be more usefully applied. How far do you agree?","A commonly held belief is that human civilization has received enormous gains from fairly expensive projects about space exploration. Yet others believe that money invested in these research areas could be redirected to solve earthly problems such as famine and global warming. Ċ Personally, I would agree that issues here on earth should be addressed first and that capital meant for extraterrestrial expeditions could solve the food crisis in large part of the world’s population. For instance, recent empirical research by the South African ministry of agriculture reported that money invested in a single lunar journey could feed an entire population of several African countries for one year. Thus, millions are dying as their governments are unable to cope with food scarcity, while rich countries are spending enormous amounts of money on space studies that are not essential for humanity’s survival. Ċ It is argued by some people that exploration of outer space will enable us to secure our future survival. They claim that by doing this, mankind will find another planet to settle. However, I feel that at this point, searching for another habitable planet is pointless because there is still time to restore climate conditions on planet Earth. For example, providing innovation in generating energy from clean sources has received the same funds as a space conquest, the global CO2 footprint would be significantly less. Therefore, extreme weather conditions that have been troubling countries around the globe for the past decade could have been avoided. Ċ In conclusion, although advanced astronautics has been enormously beneficial for humankind progress, I strongly believe that world societies should prioritize global problems like hunger and climatic warming when it comes to financial allocations."
9798,Fast-food companies should not be allowed to give away free toys with their food. To what extent do you agree or disagree? fast foods Lure Kids with Toys,"This is a common business model that some junk food restaurant owners promote their products with free toys in recent years. Some people argue that this strategy should be banned. In my opinion, I firmly agree with this statement because of following reasons. Ċ One reason is this policy can reduce obesity problems in society, especially for young generations. There are several articles point out that children are easy to gain more weight and develop an illness which should be happened in elder aging, compared to the past twenty years. This is a consequence of the artificial ingredients they obtained. Ending this marketing strategy can diminish the young people's craving for possessing hamburgers and toys at the same time, thus lower their opportunity to absorb the foods which contain less nutritious but high calories. Ċ Another reason is that prohibiting giving toys without charging with unhealthy meals can cut down the unnecessary waste for the environment. Since fast-food restaurant provides services at a fast pace, they have been intriguing some consumers to purchase junk food for saving time. For instance, some office workers who head to the KFC in the noon for efficiency. Playing is not their main purpose to walk into the store. It is a high possibility they tend to abandon the toy in the trash once they receive it. The kindness offers become meaningful and harmful to the environment. Ċ In conclusion, it seems to me that banning the promotion of selling convenience food with free toys can benefit the society and the environment by reducing the fatness issue and garbage."
9799,"When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree","Undoubtedly, urbanisation plays a crucial role in shaping the economy of any country. Hence, it is always perceived by the masses that construction operations must be incentivised for the nation's growth. I, on the other hand, strongly opine that the focus should also be given on constructing playgrounds, shopping centre whilst planning towns and cities. In this essay, we will discuss the argument in detail by citing some references. Ċ In today's world, infrastructure plays an important part which is why the authorities always prioritise such activities. Besides, due to population overgrowth, the demand for housing development is accelerating at an alarming rate. However, I concur that while proposing the aforesaid, equal importance must be driven towards building complexes for spending leisure time as well. For instance, with the currently prevailing fast-paced lifestyle, individuals often feel the need to blow off some steam by engaging themselves in various activities such as yoga, Zumba or by joining a sports club. Henceforth, buyers nowadays preferably look for such options while investing in real estate. Ċ Moreover, in order to flourish a healthy lifestyle, it is extremely important for humans to co-exist along with natural resources. For example, trees perform the air-filtration process, so with the absence of these parks and grounds, cities will be suffocated with mere buildings and as a result, the pollution will continue to increase at a fast pace. Thus, such development will hamper the city's overall health graph. Which is why the local government should consider this scenario prior to passing the tenders. Ċ To conclude, I would like to emphasize that authorities should mandate the process of organizing the township proposal which maintains an equilibrium between growth and nature. Thereby, enabling its people to indulge in a physically active lifestyle along with well-developed surroundings. This will indeed help us in creating a healthier future."
9800,Some say young people should choose the career they want to follow on their own. Others on the contrary say that the choice should be made by teachers and parents. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Give reasons for your statements and include any relevant examples from your experience.,"More and more people pay attention to career direction. Some people point out that career should be chose whatever they want, totally making their own mind.I am agreed with the front one. Ċ They argued that no one have the right to decide the career for the other people, no matter how close they are, because they don't know better than yourself. Career is very important; it is the direction of your life. Like someone says: choose the job and the person you actually like, so you can happy the 8 hours at work and very happy the rest hours. Image this, if you choose the wrong job, you would feel suck 8 hours a day in the whole life. Ċ Bill Gates, one of the wealthiest man in the world is the vividly example of choosing the career by himself. He has to fight his parent for drop off Harvard university in junior year, because he is crazy about computer, while majoring law. But we know what happen next, he achieved something more expected. Ċ However, some people don't think this way, they believed it is better to leave the choice to the people have experiences. The people, who still choose their career, is green, so listen to the people who know you better and also got in the industry, might be able to give the best advice. Ċ To sum up, I am full convinced the idea of choosing your own career, it might more difficult do by your own, but when the time you succeed, you would get the happy forever."
9801,"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success. An toefl essay Success = decent skills and determination + a bit of luck","I have to admit that luck is an important factor for the success of the successful man or celebrities. Lucky people can get the opportunity easily to show their talent or ability. These people are lucky dog. However no everyone has such good luck to get what they want. Such as some of them often encounter a plenty of difficulties and sometime become really frustrated. Ċ As mentioned above, not everyone can has a chance to make their dream come true with ease. So strictly, I think hard work is the fundamental of the success. There were too many people who made their dream came true by the means of extremely hard work. Isaiah Thomas is a case in point. Isaiah Thomas was selected by Sacramento Kings with the final pick and he get few times to show his performance but he worked hard and trained hard so that he can be a start in each game. In sum effort are more important than you think, so if you got a dream, just strive and regardless of the talent or gift. Ċ Though I mentioned that hard work is the necessary part of the final success even if we still can not ignore the luck factor. Luck can bring people the chance or opportunities and then people grasp it to exhibit their talent or show others what competence they have to finish the thing or job. For example, some read a plenty of books and can write an excellent article but no one offer him a platform to publish what he wrote. So everything he did in vain. Ċ In a conclusion, both hard work and luck are quite important for people to success but seriously effort are the most important thing in a journey towards success."
9802,Schools should not force children to learn a foreign language. To what extent do you Ċ agree with this statement?,"It is true that some people argue that a foreign language should not be one of the obligatory subjects studied in schools. While I believe that it is extremely beneficial for students to study a new language, I completely agree with the idea that they should not be forced to do so. Ċ On the one hand, it may bring many advantages if children are encouraged to learn a foreign language during their school years. First and foremost, through studying a new language they can also know more about the culture of that country, and some schools even arrange some exchange visits to enable students to immerse themselves into different countries’ cultures whose language they are learning. Secondly, children can access much beneficial information available in another language. For example, if they are studying English, they can enjoy many websites which are only available in English and find a variety of topics that they are interested in. Finally, children can be encouraged to learn a foreign vocabulary through a wide range of enjoyable and fun websites or applications nowadays, which are definitely stimulate them to have a natural reflex for both learning language and communications. Ċ On the other hand, it may cause counterproductive to forcibly oblige schoolchildren to learn a new language that they do not want. One reason for that is children will not learn effectively through compulsion alone. They must be motivated to do so and this is only achieved through enthusiastic teachers who select stimulating language-learning activities. The second is that children are reluctant to learn a foreign language if they cannot see why it may be relevant for their present and future lives. For instance, an individual Vietnamese pupil should not be forced to learn English if they are certain that they never need or want to use it for future jobs. Ċ In conclusion, I would argue that schools should encourage, but not compel, children to learn an overseas language."
9803,Many people believe that increasing levels of violence on television and in films is having a direct result on levels of violence in society. Others claim that violence in society is the result of more fundamental social problems such as unemployment. Ċ How much do you think society is affected by violence in the media?,"It is a widespread belief that TV series and thriller movies of the crime genre', are responsible for the alarming rate of violence we see in today's world. However, critics argue that the lack of employment is the force driving up the crime rate. I concur with the view that access to the screenplay version of criminal cases, presented through various media sources, significantly attributes to the increased violence in contemporary society. Ċ Firstly, the lack of earning opportunities, indeed, is one of the reasons why people are tempted to follow the criminal path. In addition, the societal taboo associated with unemployment forces them to follow the usual dark alleys of quick-money making. To illustrate the effect employment has on lawlessness, a decade-long experiment, was conducted in the slums of New York City. It was observed that youngsters who were given a chance to join the workforce pulled themselves away from the company of their still-staying-criminal background friends. Hence, this clearly depicts that lawlessness is inversely proportional to the employment levels of any place. Ċ Secondly, the indelible influence that murder-mysteries and money-heists themed movies have on the youngsters cannot be overlooked. While on the one hand, such shows and films are usually blockbuster hits, but on the other hand, many criminals take a cue from them. To illustrate further, a recent survey by a leading investigative agency, showcased how almost 80% of the convicts planned their crimes based on a similar movie or series. Ċ To conclude, it is fair to state that tools like the TV & movies that we have created are slowly eroding the social fabric of the peaceful society we once lived in. Therefore, It is imperative that the government and the rating agencies, make sure that such thrillers are rated, age-appropriate to curb the ever-increasing crime amongst the youngsters."
9804,"When a new town is planned, it is more important to develop public parks and sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their time in. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The priority of green areas developments and enhancing gyms or shopping centres has become a controversial argument in the time of planning a new city. Personally, I believe that both of the mentioned factors are important for people to spend their time in and it is a two-sided sword. Ċ Anyone hand shopping centres are right all due to both the economy and enjoyment. Many businesses are dependent on trading and also people need to be able to fulfil their needs. For example, if a city does not have a good shopping centre, people will have to go to another town to buy a dress or an umbrella which may result in dissatisfaction. Moreover, shopping is not just about buying but it is also a good time and place for people to hang out. It may increase the chance of buying because studies have shown that happiness positively affect trading and gathering around with friends in malls is likely to make people enjoy. Ċ On the other hand, public parks and sports facilities would play a key role in citizens' lifestyles and health. Pastimes in nature should have a great impact on mental health. In other words, spending time in public parks with a lot of trees and grass would help people to breathe fresh air which boosts their mood. In addition, residents can do sports such as running in the parks or attending a gym. This might confront the sedentary lifestyle of today's world. Consequently, if the majority, especially the workforce, remain healthy and motivated, this city would see fast progress. Ċ In conclusion, I think green areas and sports facilities positively affect the citizens' lifestyle but shopping centres are just equally important. As a result, I would argue that one of them are more important for a new town."
9805,It is often thought that the increase in juvenile crime can be attributed to violence in the media. What do you think is the reason for a growth in the rate of juvenile crime? What solutions can be offer to deal with this situation.,"Juvenile delinquency has been always one of the most topics of debate.According to some people,crimes committed by teenagers have been expanded at an alarming rate due to their exposure to violent movies, TV shows and other video games.In this essay,I will discuss the reasons that led to this growth and further steps for solving this phenomenon. Ċ To begin with,brutal contents depicted in media are the major reason for juvenile crimes.As they are heavily influenced by what they are watched they will try to mimic those materials,which will carry out aggressive behaviours in their homes, schools and public places.For instance, a recent study shows that the genocide that has been happened in Newzeland happened because the murder was influenced by a violent computer game.In spite of this, it's clear that media has a drastic impact on youngsters. Ċ both government and individuals should tackle the above-mentioned problem with some steps in order to reduce those crime tendencies.Governments have to launch many programs to raise the awareness of teenagers to avoid this sort of crime.As a part of society,parents have to look after their teens as they are passing throw a critical period of time in their life.For example,this can be implemented by going to a psychologist to set a plan on who they should be raised.Furthermore,parents should monitor their juveniles consumed materials and deprived them of dangerous ones. Ċ To sum up, violent media jeopardises youngsters future as they used to imitate what they have been seen,whereas government rehabilitation programs and parents intensive monitoring might be the best solution to fight this dilemma."
9806,"Some people think that it s necessary to involve the whole family into nurturing and upbringing a child, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The question of whether a whole family is needed to raise a child is a topical issue today. It is considered by some that children ought to be brought up in a multigenerational family, while others argue that a two-parent family might be more beneficial. Both sides of the argument will be examined and I will discuss them now. Ċ On the one hand, a joint effort by the parents and other relatives is vital to successfully raise a child. Not only can relatives provide great assistance to parents, who might consider focusing more on their career, but also parenting behaviour might improve. Furthermore, kin can enable emotional support for children, while providing more opportunities for conversation and social interaction. As a result, a socially enriched environment is the best way for children to grow up, which is illustrated by the fact that living under one roof is more cost-effective. For instance, according to a recent study by Oxford University, with such lifestyle 40 per cent of monthly costs can be saved. Ċ Conversely, there are some people who are opponents of whole family upbringing. They often argue, that parents need privacy, so it would be more advisable to live separately as a nuclear family. For example, as only three to five people would live together, depending on the number of children, this lifestyle would involve less housework as there are fewer people living together. In my opinion, the described way of living is not the most beneficial. Ċ To conclude, the given topic can be quite controversial to some, while others favour the described lifestyle. A discussion of the merits and the drawbacks of upbringing a child in a whole family was discussed. In my view, it is more beneficial for society to live together as a whole family, and not just as a nuclear family."
9807,Write about the following topic: Ċ Every country has poor people and every country has different ways of dealing with the poor. Ċ What are some of the reasons for world poverty? How can the poor be helped? Ċ Give reasons for your answers and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"As the modern-day world becomes increasingly advanced and more developed, poverty might seem like a problem of the past. But, the numbers of people living below the poverty line are on the rise. In this essay,I will discuss the causes of this issue, as well as propose possible ways we can help the poor. Ċ First and foremost, the lack of family planning in many countries is one of the main reasons why many populations remain poor. Although some individuals do not have the means to support themselves, they choose to have more children. For example, I was taught in school that in poor African countries, the average family has seven children, while, in reality, they can afford to have only two. Secondly, the bad educational system in schools contributes to the non-ending poverty pandemic. I recently came across a study published in Harvard Business Review that stated how the less efficient a person's education is, the less likely he is to become financially enabled. Ċ As for the possible ways to aid the poor, I would say that food banks play a major role in preventing them from developing malnutrition. For instance, I worked at Indiana's Food Bank and saw a large number of families dependant on such institutions to provide them with food on the table. Shelters also play an important part in allowing them a place to spend the night. Therefore, providing them with safety and protection from the cold. To give an example, visiting a homeless shelter, in 2018, I saw how many people were able to get back on their feet once they were provided with a roof on their heads. Ċ To conclude, the majority of third-world countries live below their means. The reasons why this is not eliminated yet are varied and I believe that the most important of which are bad education systems and non-existent plans to restrict the size of families. Additionally, food banks and homeless shelters are of vital importance in helping the poor."
9808,Teenagers have problems at home and school. What difficulties are they facing now? What should parents and schools do to help them?,"This is a universally acknowledged fact that the upcoming generations are always considered to be as a nation builder. Teenager’s years are the most delicate years of a person’s life. It is believed that they usually face a lot of problems to share their difficulties with others so parents, as well as tutors, can be played a prominent role solve their problems. These points of view will be discussed in the forthcoming paragraphs. Ċ It is certainly true that the person at his teenage is not able to adopt all things which can be easily caught by an adult. They face enormous problems in their academic and other extracurricular activities. For instance, most of the parents compel their pupils to choose a particular stream in which they have no interest. Thus, it puts a negative effect on their studies and future. Additionally, the teacher may be partially deal with some learners so that’s why they cannot understand all techniques in various technical subjects such as mathematics and science. Therefore, they lose their courage and cannot put their best efforts to achieve success in life. Ċ However, the parents should give full freedom to children to select a field in their study. They also should spend enough time with their children so that they can gain knowledge about their traditions, customs and family history. Inclusively, the educational institution can organise sports events at least once a month so teenagers develop their traits like team-work, co-ordination, team-spirit and tolerance. It is crystallized that these measures will really help to boost up the confidence of teenagers. Ċ To conclude, analyzing the above points, it has been proved that it is the responsibility of both parents as well as tutors to help them with every problem. It is undoubtedly true that teenagers are not fully mentally sturdy to take a crucial decision for their foreseeable future."
9809,"disadvantages of rapid urbanisation These days, people from urban areas come to the city to look for a better life. However, the drawbacks of urbanisation is a major problem in many cities. Explain some of the problems caused by urbanisation. How can governments make urban life better for everyone?","Urbanisation, which is a deep-seated problem in our society these days, is thought to be detrimental to the majority of the population. It lowers life quality in urban areas and raises crime rate. The essay below attempts to elaborate on the drawbacks of urbanisation and proposes some resolutions to it. Ċ Cities are highly vulnerable under the effect of urbanisation. More than often, this phenomena creates overcrowding and lack of sanitation, leading to diseases outbreak. At the same time, urbanisation potentially triggers the shortage in utilities in utilities, such as water, electricity and sewage disposal. Another down side of this problem is the constantly rising crime rates. Unfortunately, a high proportion of immigrants into urban areas are forced to reside in slums, which are not owned by them. Meanwhile, slums are widely regarded as the breeding ground for criminal activities. Maintenance of law and order, therefore, becomes more difficult. Ċ To achieve the goal of sustainable development, the government needs to put the crisis of urbanisation on its agenda and come up with practical resolutions. To combat the lack of utilities, those with higher power should create more private and public partnerships and provide waste; water and housing disposal for residents. At the same time, they should also enforce the widespread of education so that it can reach even slum residents. With proper training and housing development, both life quality and order maintenance shall be heightened. Ċ In conclusion, urbanisation is definitely not something for society to overlook, and it generally takes elaborative steps to approach its disadvantages."
9810,"As public safety is of the highest importance, it is often necessary to test new products on animals. It is better for a few animals to suffer from for human life to be placed at risk by untested products. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","The testing of new products on animals is controversial. Some people claim that in view of public safety, it is essential to test these new products on animals. These people also feel that instead of putting human life at risk, it is better for a few animals suffer by untested products. I completely agree with this statement. Ċ Firstly, few animals has the same genetic configuration as that of humans. Hence their manifestations are similar to the humans. For instance, injection insulin is a life saving drug for diabetics. It was released to the public, only after testing on animals for immediate and delayed manifestations. Perhaps, millions of people would have succumbed to diabetes, if this life saving drug was not tested on animals. Therefore, to attain utmost safety for millions of people any new drug or product must ensure adequate testing on animals, which are genetically similar to human genome. Ċ Secondly, humans are allergic to certain chemicals and they are prone to anaphylactic shock, which can cause death instantly. For example, certain untested perfumes or deodorants can result in severe life threatening allergic reactions. Moreover, if some animals are sacrificed while testing, it has indirectly saved lives of thousands of people. Because, such products will not be released into the market. Overall, humans can be at risk, if they are using products, which are not tested adequately. Ċ In conclusion, many human lives can be protected, if the new products undergo prior adequate animal testing. Finally, harming few animals is better than risking the human life."
9811,"migration from rural to urban areas In the last twentieth century, the proportion of the world's population living in cities has increased substantially. People have moved in ever growing numbers to urban areas. As immigration from rural areas to cities continues, it is inevitable that the infrastructure in these cities will collapse. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","After end of previous century until now, people are motivated to live in the cities. This treatment of people has some problems for these cities, such as shortage of basic facilities for new arrivers. This essay tries to discuss about my agreement about this topic and express my opinion. Ċ In the first, by growing suddenly the population of people in one city, the infrastructure such as water, gas, sewerage, electricity cannot increase as the same rate as the grows of the population. So, outskirts will be appeared with low level of basic facilities. As we can see these days, around many big cities, a lot of areas are occupied by poor without any fundamental facilities. Ċ Also, these people need education and job, it should be provided more schools, universities, companies by municipal, which makes long time and process to produce the facilities for whole of people. Because education needs to hire teachers, professors and researchers and provide budget to support them. Ċ In addition, many big cities has to provide huge amount of budget for building new park, cinema and shopping centers, which cannot be available in the short period of time and managing the structure of city for extra population needs deep knowledge and design. Ċ In the summary, whole of my explanation shows that growing fast population of cities makes them creditably challenge to provide facilities as the same rate. The water, sewerage, electricity should be extend to avoid to face poor area around cities. Also, education cannot be easily provided for whole of people. In the end, design of more area for entertainment needs long time."
9812,"Many people believe that it is important to always tell the truth. In your opinion, is it ever acceptable to tell a lie?  Explain your answer giving reasons and specific examples.","It is true that telling the truth is always essential. Although it can be argued that telling a lie is sometimes allowed in some cases, I believe that it is better to be honest at any time. Ċ On the one hand, some people think that they are able to tell lies in some particular circumstances . In order to protect their children, their family, their friends and people around them from the bad news, people tend to tell lies. This will help to ensure people's emotion as long as the mental and physical status. For example, A family in which parents divorce, their children may feel shock and depressed. The adults try to prevent to let them know about that news until their children grow up. Ċ On the other hand, I would agree with those who believe that people should be always necessary to tell the truth since honesty is the basic thing in this developing society. If all people in this world are liar, of course the life will become more and more difficult. Without the belief between people, we can't endure any relationships. For example, when you count on your best friend, you honestly share everything with her but when you realize that she's not actually tell you the truth because of some purposes, you will become angry and your friendship will be broken. Ċ In conclusion, it seems to me that an ideal world will be created by honest people, we should always try our best to tell the truth."""
9813,Levels of youth crime are increasing rapidly in most cities around the world.What are the reasons for this and suggest some solutions.,"Increasing crime among the youth has become a controversial issue in the major cities throughout the globe.This is mainly due to the influence of the digital media, and possible solutions to prevent the youngsters from their worst effects is to keep a close eye on their activity and peer groups. Ċ The major possible cause of the rising criminal record of the teenagers is the adverse impacts of the shows that are being telecasted these days.Since most of our films and TV shows are based on thrills and adventurous scenes which includes immense violence, youth simply imitate what they see because they do not realise that these are not real.In India, for instance, particularly in the metropolitan cities, such as Mumbai, Delhi, a record increase in the criminal habits of the youngsters has been recorded in the past few years.Thus despiteAccept comma additionThus, despite having useful effects of the digital sources on the society, its potential impacts on the adolescence cannot be overlooked. Ċ However, the solutions to avoid this problem are not simple.First of all, parents must take responsibility to raise their wards and should impart moral values in them.But this can be achieved only if they supervise their children and spend quality time with them along with the proper knowledge of their friends circle.For example, parents must check the ratings of the movies before allowing their child, and in fact they must accompany them.To elucidate, with the proper supervision by the fathers' and even mothers' they can be prevented from going in the wrong direction. Ċ In conclusion, undeniably, our youth is deviating on the false path, and is committing serious offences which is not at all appropriate.Although the electronic equipments has greatly impacted their physical and mental development, this issue can be resolved to some extent, if parents play their role in raising their children properly."
9814,IELTS [Task2] To what extent do you agree or disagree. The youth in many countries is employed and unskilled. Compulsory military service is good and necessary.,"In many countries, military attract people to be soldiers by providing much professional training, benefits of salary and so on. I served in the army for a year in Taiwan, but either I or my partners did not learn any useful skills there. My view is that serving compulsorily in the armed forces is bad and not necessary. Here are my reasons. Ċ First of all, the life in the corps is tough. Soldiers are not only losing freedom but also wasting time and talents. Warriors work for 24 hours and sometimes have to follow unreasonable orders. A friend of mine who is good at playing piano prepared to study aboard. In May 2009, when he graduated from a university, receiving the information that he had become a navy. Unfortunately, he is a normal administrator that is a replaceable job in one prospectless company. Ċ Another reason why I disagree with that compulsory military service is good and necessary is that the idea might be dangerous and fatal. In July 2013, for instance, there was a tragedy accident in the army in Taiwan. Hung Chung-Chu whose an army soldier died because of his superior over punishment. Another example, in 2003, the U.S. with other powerful countries sent their servicemen and servicewomen to Iraq, there were over 4500 corpses in the battle. Ċ Some people might claim that salary and welfare are better than other jobs. However, these benefits are established on high-risk missions or works duties. Thus, I do not sacrifice my freedom and life expectancy for working in the forces enforcedly."
9815,"IELTS WRITING TASK 2: HEALTHCARE Advanced medical treatments are generally expensive. People's access to proper health care should not depend upon their level of income. All people have the right to access the best medicine available""","In more recent decades, the issue of whether the same quality of healthcare and treatment should be provided to every resident has remained a matter for debate. This essay will explain why the idea mentioned above should not be bring into reality. Ċ To begin with, there would be much more presure putting on the healthcare system if all indivisuals had access to the most advanced medical treatments. To take the National Health Service in the United Kingdom as a classic example, the state hospitals are difficult to run in spite of their extreme effords, because they always have very long waiting lists for operations and appointments. As an ineviable consequence, a lot of people may suffer from slow treatment. This example illustrates the current situation in which patients are being equally treated with the latest remedies. Ċ Another reason is that such ideal policy which guarantee people with the adequate health services may constrain the national development. First, because the government must invest a large amount of the tax money in healthcare, other areas such as education and environment will suffer from cutbacks and underfunding. Second, people may take the welfare state for granted, so they do not have to work hard but still be able to enjoy a reasonable quality of lives. In these ways, giving out the same level of treatment to every patient is capable of damaging the economy. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that we should not provide adequate healthcare to the public for our own interest as well as the whole nation."
9816,Eating a balanced diet is the most important factor for a healthy life. Ċ To what extent do you agree?,"There is a drastic change in eating habits compared to primitive times and it is crucial to be mindful of what we are intaking in order to lead a healthier life. I agree to a far extent with the above statement and this essay will explain the reasons supporting my views. Ċ To commence with, there are many reasons why I think having a balanced diet plays a vital role in living a healthy life. Firstly, it has become common to skip breakfast due to busy-life, as everyone is rushing to work and do not have enough time to cook and eat, which leads to our second point. The fast-food has taken over home-made food, this is due to the hectic work schedule, and people find it easy and convenient. To illustrate, an individual can end up having the cholesterol level high if he is not watching out food consumed. Ċ Furthermore, obesity is another key factor that needs to be prioritised, as it is one of the commonly found issues in this contemporary world. In other words, it is notable that children who are noticed overly weighted are due to high consumption of junk and sugary foods. Lastly, it is irrefutable that PlayStation and other electronic gadgets have taken away physical activities from the young minds, subsequently, it has a negative impact among the new generation. For instance, parents should prohibit their offspring from using video games and should be encouraged to play on the ground, which can avoid them from becoming a couch potato Ċ To conclude, I would like to reiterate that it is noteworthy to be considerate about one’s fitness will have a significant impact on their natural life, eventually, it can influence the society with such a meaningful good habit."
9817,It is better to learn the way people lived in the past through films and video records than written documents. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is important for people to become educated about events that happened in the past. Whereas some people believe that learning through films or videos is better, while it is helpful, I would argue that learning from written documents such as Wikipedia or by surfing the internet should be also taken into consideration up to a point. Ċ One of the most crucial advantages behind the education about people who lived in the past via watching a movie is simplicity in receiving the required information. This is because the duration of a movie is usually one to two hours, and this makes it easier for the receiver to build a background when compared with the traditional way of learning. Troy, for instance, was one of the most successful true-story films that presented the life of the ancient Romans. The film’s content had some vital details that cannot be easily found in books. Consequently, some people will find it difficult to search for the same content in books as it might take a longer period of time than watching a movie. Ċ Moreover, many people would find it boring to learn about a certain event via written documents. The reason behind this is that these written documents do not have graphics or audio to attract learners. It has been shown that the vast majority of people would prefer to learn through watching a movie faster than the written documents. Nevertheless, some people, especially the elderly who are interested in learning about people’s old lives have libraries that include some of the old books to return to them when needed specific information. Not only this, but some of them would use the internet in terms of educating about the past. Ċ In conclusion, although having appropriate knowledge about past lives by watching movies is much more entertaining and easier than learning via written documents, I believe that the latter should not be neglected."
9818,"For many shopping malls are great places to spend their leisure time and meet others.People, however, in the past mostly visited shopping malls when necessary.To what extent do you think this is a negative trend.","Nowadays, people are going to shopping malls to purchase purpose and spend time meeting and gossiping with the near one, compared to the past when public accessed the supermarkets only for buy and sell solely whenever they needed. In my opinion, there are two reasons for this negative development and this essay will outline the topic and will demonstrate my reasonings behind this negative trend. Ċ Firstly, shopping centres are built with the objective of purchasing products and selling them from outlets not for fun. Most of the shopping plazas have smaller spaces to accommodate all the consumers, as a result, folks who are there for gossiping and meeting with friends are actually enhancing the crowd and making the place noisier that consequently leading to the feeling of irritating for the actual buyers and they sometimes go out without purchasing anything. For example, guards of many shopping malls are seen to request the public to avoid the front side of the mall and suggest them to gossip anywhere else. Ċ Secondly, the increasing tendency of the society for spending pleasure in shopping deviates them from having hangouts in organic places. Gardens and parks are healthy places for spending pleasures moments since the green environment develops the sight effectiveness. Moreover, cities are full noisy and affected mostly by air pollution, in that case, parks are the only place to have tranquillity and fresh air which are healthy to consume. Ċ In conclusion, spending pleasures with friends in the shopping market not only interrupt the buyers but also it is unhealthy to be always in a noisy area like this place. People should choose parks and gardens where they can soothe their minds by enjoying a quiet environment and green scenarios."
9819,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should encourage students to use computer from primary school age on. Give details and examples to support your answer.,"In the modern world having knowledge and skill on computer is indispensable. Science is progressing with a great speed, and every part of life and every kinds of job are engaged with computer. Hence, grasping computer skills have got so vital due to having a successful professional life, and computer skills should be both taught and encouraged by teachers. In fact, not only does utilizing and learning this necessity from primary school provide a better future for students, but also it helps their learning process. Ċ The most persuasive point is that by using computer at schools, the students' future can be assured. It means because every job's requirements is knowing computer skills, the chance to be enrolled in a position is stronger for them in the future. It is a fact that learning ability in low age is highly stronger and viable than high age. Teachers should take advantage of this feature of children and encourage them to use computer. Therefore, students can learn this elaborate and wide skill easier and very fast yet unforgettable. Ċ Another reason that deserves some words here is that by the way of computer teacher can be able to use some software and facilities in order to teach their students. Computer provides the ease to accelerate the learning process of students. In the past students have a lot of problems to realize or imagine a fact. Now, however, by computer they can enhance their imagery, imagination, and suggestibility. Ċ In sum, based on all the aforementioned reasons, it is rational to draw the conclusion that utilizing computer at primary schools, both teacher and students have the access to many facilities which make the learning process easier. Moreover, computer skills reassure the future work-life. Even maybe some schools require the teachers and students to have the computer using in their curriculum."
9820,Topic: Young people without work experience are hardly to find a suitable jobs. Gorvements encounrage employers to use young people when they need. Should agree or disagree?,"Thank to the support of governments, employers are possible to generate work opportunities for young people.The encouragerment completely brings benefits both to employers and young worker. Ċ To commence with, two extensive advantages young people received from companies are having job experience and less pressure on finding a jobs. Nowadays, seldom do young people get an appropriate work which are pressumble to indentify long time with. Consequently, that demand of employers lead more working chances, make condition to confirm the scholastic knowledge. Beyond confirmation there were further that new workers also additionally learn more work awareness during the process of practicing what they have ever been uneducated at school.That reality job understanding helps young people to relize which job is flexible with them,makes their adjustable decision. Ċ Viewing from employers aspect, government encouraging also effect them to reach facility. On the ground of satisfaction about the human resource, that youth own active and creative spirit,are fairy large group. On the other hand, albeit wasting time to train new worker are feasible to be a disadvantage, that their scholartic awareness necessarily still store, practice it in task what longtime workers are possible to lose. Equally significant, enhancement to use young laborer helps to improve the temporatly unemployment situation incrasing in numerous countries. Ċ The facts of the matter therefore seem clear, only by scholartic economy inspection, motivation employers to use young people counterbalance national economy. It is the same recognition to inspect from society. In sum, by dint of advantages, the encouragement of governments about enhancing young people work is necessary to support in countries."
9821,"Present a written argument or case to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic. Ċ Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves? Ċ Use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and with relevant evidence. Ċ You should write at least 250 words.","Is there any ending for human suffering on this plant? Every day, we see young children dead on the streets because lack of daily essentials such as nutrition, health care and education. In the last centuries, the world has suspected huge social differences between two main parts: developed countries and the poor ones. Therefore, I believe wealthy people should start to help others who are in critical situations for historical and survival causes. Ċ First of all, many nations conquered weak populations in the past leaving them without any resources. In fact, their project was to expand the geographical limits of the kingdom. For instance, the British empire was known for the fact which sun remain all the year in its territory as a symbol of gigantic expansion. As result, different cultures were included as parts of one authority that used their manpower, natural energy, and raw materials. This reality forces rich persons to share part of their fortune that is originally possessed by others. Ċ Another reason, humanity is under the threat of extinction, if we continue fighting for money and power. Nobody can ignore the dangerous actions used on fragile communities in order to increase the quality of life for one small group only. Research shows that 90% of global wealth are distributed between 5% of the world population, while the other 95% are suffering to satisfy their daily needs. So, what if this treasure were well-shared on this planet? Our race will continue to involve reaching our future generations. Ċ To conclude, wealthy groups are directly responsible to assist needed families with jobs, and they must provide necessary facilities like hospitals, schools, and charities. I hope that we start to look for each other in a more compassionate way in order to eliminate discrimination from our societies."
9822,Many men and women are making the decision to have children later in life. Why is this trend occurring? What are the impacts of this development on both family and society?,"Nowadays, in many countries, it has been noticed that people are choosing to become parents later in their life. This essay will discuss the reasons for this development and the possible effects on families and society. Ċ The main reason for this trend is changing employment patterns. As more women started getting an education and enter the workforce, they tend to marry later and have children later in their life. In contrast to the past, people now are not able to maintain Correct article usage a It seems that article use may be incorrect here. Ċ show exampleswork-life balance, due to this they do not take a chance of starting a family. For example, since both men and woman be busy in their frenetic work schedule, they do not get time to think about children otherwise. Therefore, couples plan to start their family after they are settled in their life. Ċ Consequently, this creates an impact on families and the community. Firstly, with regards to the families, it becomes difficult for older ladies to get pregnant and may experience more health problems, such as a miscarriage, high blood pressure, which creates complications during the birth of a child. Furthermore, older parents may find the whole experience of bringing up a child more tiring if they are older. Secondly, with regards to society, if there are more people working at their young age, then a country will have a productive workforce to develop the nation. However, in the long-term, falling fertility rates will mean an ageing population with a lack of young people to join the workplace. Ċ In conclusion, there are several reasons for a younger generation to not have children at their early age after marriage which creates a positive and negative impact on families and society. If peoples’ lifestyle is not changed, then this trend is likely to continue in the future."
9823,Some jobs require parents to travel a great deal. What are the effects on the parents who have to travel? What effects dos this have on the family in general? Discuss inluding examples from your own knowledge and experience.,"With the enormous modernization of the world today, tremendous businesses tend to expand. Because of this, a vast number of individuals are necessary to enhance their workforce. Most of these people are willing parents to leave their home country for the opportunity to get employed. However, with this certain job extends the possibility of tremendous family issues. Ċ Firstly, being hired for an overseas job requires a broad understanding of culture shock and homesickness. Each country possesses its own culture and traditions, which might be surprisingly different from what one has lived with since birth. Because of this, an expatriate can find it challenging to adapt to the unfamiliar environment. Secondly, being away from one's family can represent the most dreadful emotional sacrifice a person must acknowledge. Regardless of the advancements of technology, the tangible presence of a child and a spouse cannot be replaced with virtual hugs and kisses.During my recent work in Abu Dhabi, I found it extremely difficult to disregard my solitary feeling; because nothing can replace the emotional attachment that I have with my loved ones. Hence, a great deal of adjustments is required to cope up with the diversity of the current community and its possible emotional effect. Ċ Likewise, the absence of a parent can equally affect the development of the children. This is possible since young people tend to search for an alternative company from others, which might lead him to make bad decisions and break rules and regulations. On top of that, there can be a possibility for the child to develop destructive relationships due to the less guidance coming from the caregivers. With the added social issues, a family tend to be dysfunctional afterwards. For example, a son might seek for a mother figure by fostering short-term relationships with several women. Considering the abovementioned effects, distance, both physical and emotional, can result in a long-term social and psychological setback to a developing child. Ċ In conclusion, in spite of the financial and career advantages produced by overseas employment, a broad list of its drawbacks are still happening nowadays. Therefore, I believe that no monetary stability can replace the foundation and the general structure of a family."
9824,"Technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in the world today. In the not too distant future, technology will completely replace the teacher in the classroom. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In the modern era, technology usage has been increased a lot than in the past. There have been immense advances in technology in most aspects of people's lives.An increasing number of students rely on computers for research and to produce perfect paper for school purposes.There is not distance future. Machineries will totally replace the teachers in the classroom.However, I completely disagree with the given hook and will explain both viewpoints in the below paragraph with reasoned conclusion. Ċ To start with, the machinery has certain advantages behind this occurs. Firstly, it helps to watch lectures again and again. For example, if a student leaves any period regarding his study in school, he or she unable to understand again, as a teacher has no time.When they opt for technology system that provides videos which students can watch limitless and at any time.Secondly, some students have a lack of confidence. Because of this, they always stay away from their teachers. They deem that their tutors will punish due their mistakes.Therefore, they like to study, sitting at their home, with the help of a computer. Ċ On the other side, teachers play a vital role in the life of students. Professors are always emotional as well as helpful.For instance, teachers have in-depth knowledge about their courses.A coach knows about the situation of pupil that what methods, protocols, and kinds of education, he or she had to need.In other words, technology has no control over its students. It is commonly understood that children require the watchful eye of a teacher to ensure that they are indeed completing their class work and not fooling around during class time which will further create a routine and discipline in every student's life. Ċ To conclude, although modern technology is making numerous breakthroughs such as an attempt to completely replace humans in education arena; this is improbable due to the fact that they are artificial and have a lack of understanding of a real guide.Hence, technology cannot replace tutors in the classroom, but it is possible to offer online courses through student- teacher interaction."
9825,It is common nowadays for each member of the family to have their own piece of modern technology. Some people think this will lead to a break down in family relationships and communication. To what extent do you agree?,"Nowadays, all family members have their own modern devices such as mobile devices, laptops, tablets, etc. Some people state that this would affect family relations and communication. As a result, it may cause to break down in the family. However, I disagree with this idea for many reasons. In the following paragraphs, the reasons to support my disagreement will be outlined in detail. Ċ Firstly, cutting-edge technology benefits people, including developing a relationship with others and enhancing communication skills. Moreover, the family can find more actives to spend time together by utilizing modern technology. For example, parents can play some educational games with their kids by using a laptop. Besides, kids can learn and do their assignments, and then parents can help their children improve communication skills and social skills through online channels. Ċ In addition, modern technology can connect family members who live in different places, making them closer. For instance, some students have to study overseas, but they can easily interact with their parents via a VDO call. Another good example is that dad has to work in another province. Nevertheless, he built a relationship with his family by calling them. From my perspective, I believe that the cause of breaking down in the family may cause by other factors such as carelessness from parents. Ċ In conclusion, I cannot entirely agree with the idea that modern technology may reduce family members' ties since people can adapt it in order to build a strong bond and reduce the distance of their relationship."
9826,"In nations that have already gained great wealth, any additional economic prosperity would not make people more satisfied. Do you agree or disagree?","There has been long a widespread public debate surrounding the effect of extra-economic prosperity on more happiness of citizens. Some people argue that in super-rich countries, any extra-economic wealth would not enable their population to be more pleased. However, I completely disagree with the idea for different reasons. Ċ Once a country has produced vast wealth, It can more improve its health care system. Given the status quo, citizens are able to be to feel more satisfied than before. In fact, the governments that have earned extra money are capable of providing their residents with the newest treatments because they can spend a considerable amount of money purchasing high-end medical facilities and conducting plenty of medical research that is extremely costly. Besides, their health care system can be free of charge for all people living in those countries. Consequently, social members are far more likely to be happier by additional economic wealth. Ċ Moreover, educational and transportation systems have positive effects on citizen’s happiness. In other words, more affluent societies gaining extra money are capable of boosting the quality of education beyond. They can allow, for instance, their children to attend schools, universities, and scientific seminars compulsorily. In addition to that, with increased ,wealth the state will create better roads and transport, which can save people time and prevent road fatalities. In that case, In UAE, the government heavily invests in the construction of an ultra-modern vehicle called Hyperloop to facilitate citizens’ commute. Ċ To sum up, I would argue that in wealthy nations, any extra-economic prosperity would make a contribution to more people’s pleased due to the fact that the level of health, education, and transportation would be improved."
9827,"In spite of the many advances women have made in education and employment, they continue to be at a disadvantage when it comes to pay and promotion. In your view, what should be done to promote equality of opportunity for men and women in the workplace? gender inequality problem","Thanks to the development in education and employment, there is now greater equality between men and women. However, women still tend to earn less and lack of promotion in their occupation. In my viewpoint, it is vital to take action constructively in order to gain opportunity equally for both two genders. Ċ One feasible approach would be for government to force employers to take on the same numbers of men and women, give them equivalent workloads and pay them the same salaries. By this way, women and men will have equality in not only salary but also promotion. This solution would take a long time to success. Nevertheless, the problem is that government could have trouble in taking resources to do statistics. Ċ To further encourage equality, governments should take the lead in ensuring that the salary companies pay based on employer's productivity. That means the important factor is the ability of employers, not the gender they are. If they work hard and bring income to their company, they will earn much money and also have chances to get a higher position. This would establish gender equality as a norm of society and set a good example for private companies. However, this solution would be a disadvantage for women in jobs requiring much physical strength. Ċ It is obvious that the problem of gender inequality in the workplace will probably not be tackled quickly. Nevertheless, government and the community should pay more attention and take action now. Especially, the government should be the leader in changing thinking of companies so that they will more concerned on women's equality."
9828,"Nowadays, as women and men have to work full time, household duties should be equally divided. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Many people say that women and men should split the domestic chores equally because both partners have full-time jobs. In my opinion, I agree with this idea to some certain extend Ċ On the one hand, bearing equal household chore could bring about a lot of merits for families. Firstly, equal division of household responsibilities could help to develop mutual understandings between partners. It is because when couples share family duties equally, they are likely to provide couples with common experiences and interests, which means that spouses could initiate conversations or share difficulties on this topic. Secondly, equal division of household chores could reduce the level of stress attributed to being overwhelmed by these duties. Sharing household responsibilities allows no partner to be over-burdened with the responsibilities at home, which results in the improvement in the well-being of the whole family. Ċ On the other hand, household responsibilities should be shared in a flexible way rather than too strict. It is because, although both partners have full-time jobs, the characteristics of each job such as workloads or working schedules vary. Thus, in a family, if husbands have highly demanding jobs that requires a large proportion of their time and effort, wives should share the responsibilities with their partners by doing a greater amount of household duties. Similarly, when pregnant, women might struggle to do domestic chores; hence, husbands should handle physically demanding tasks to relieve the burden that the wives have to bear. Ċ In conclusion, there is no absolute rule to the division of housework in a family. Both partners should carry the number of domestic chores within their capabilities."
9829,The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. Ċ What are the causes of this? Ċ What can be done to solve this problem?,"It is a horrendous truth, that rapid growth in manufacturing of goods affects the environment drastically. There are a plethora of reasons, why this product manufacturing causing the issues, such as deforestation for construction, goods-producing factories generate toxic fumes and polluted water into the rivers, but nevertheless,there are some considerable solutions of this misfortune like, plant more trees and limit the working time for factories. Ċ To begin with, the significant cause of damage is cutting down trees for the construction of new colonies because of the growth in population and personal preferences. Although, people are in need of more houses, so the companies continually clearing land. Additionally, There are a lot of industries in every city, those are creating pollution while manufacturing process, for example, soap and chemical producer farms mix their dirty water into natural rivers and smoke from chimnies pollute the climate. Ċ Furthermore, if there are problems associated with the production of consumer goods than there are several solutions, for instance, planting more trees is one of the best ways to mitigate the obstacle. However, cutting down trees could cause more serious problems, but still,nations should plant more trees to protect the atmosphere. Second, the government should restrict the working hours and limit production, so companies could make the required stuff. Moreover, factories have no limit restrictions on them, that's why they produce more products for their profits. Ċ In conclusion, even though raise in the manufacture industries cause complications for the natural surroundings, but therefore, some possible steps would make a difference to prevent the damage from industries."
9830,Some people think that social media is bring us further apart. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Many people believe that social media platforms widen the gap between people. To a certain extent, I advocate this point of view. Ċ On the one hand, it is true that social media helps to bridge the gap between people and encourage people to come together to solve problems. Firstly, through social networking sites, people can stay in touch with their loved ones regardless of geographical distance. Some features of social media sites such as texting or video calls allow people to reach their friends and make visual interact no matter how far they are, which helps to improve the quality of relationships. Secondly, social media is a tool to unite people and organizations across the world to tackle social issues. For instance, ENV, which is a conservation organization in Vietnam, has a customized strategy to use social media as a tool to spread the message of protecting wildlife animals. This campaign has engaged a lot of young Vietnamese people and they form a community to make a pledge not to use products from wildlife animals. Ċ On the other hand, although the rapid emergence of social media has greatly facilitated communication between people around the world, it also has numerous detrimental effects on the relationships between people. The first drawback is that social media can lead to a loss of physical connection. Many people are placing their real-life relationships with virtual connections as social media is considered a more convenient way to communicate and brings people a sense of connectedness. As a result, this loss of face to face interactions could push people away from their own community and lead to social isolation. In addition, social media could be a major distraction in daily lives and interactions. For example, in a gathering, young people often stick to their smartphone to check messages or notifications rather than engaging in actual conservation, which could lead to the destruction of relationships between people. Ċ In conclusion, while social media can bring about some benefits regarding connecting people, it also causes a reduction in face-to-face conversations and builds an invisible wall between people."
9831,Topic: You are planning to study abroad. What do you think you will like and dislike about this experience? Is Studying Abroad Difficult?,"Some people think that study abroad really good experiment and other people abhor it. But in my view this have some Advantage and disadvantage which I would explore most primary of them as follows. First I think when I go to new place I would get new information which make me stronger in my major. For example last week I went to my neighborhood country and saw that those student studied just in university. It was very usual behavior between them. They said that atmosphere of university motive us that study more. Ċ Second when I go to new place I would be accustomed with new method and would be helpful for me. For example for a chemist student which is my major it is very important to be costume with variety of purification method. I often use crystallization for purification of my product, but it is not always useful. In my traveling to Japan, I went to a chemistry lab which was used chromatography method for purification. Ċ However, I think generally change is good, by the way there is some disadvantage in study abroad. For example when you be far away from your home for long time, you may get homesick. Ċ Another disadvantage of study abroad is being unaccustomed at first. For example when was in International University of China saw they eat meat of dog or had some special behavior in their greeting. These stuff was very awesome for me at the first. Ċ In the end I like study abroad, although has some difficulty. I can be accustomed with another culture and get new information and new method for solving my problems."
9832,Some people say that travel helps us to appreciate other cultures. How true is this statement? Do you think that people who travel  a lot appreciate other cultures more than those  stay at home?,"Traveling is the best way to relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery after the hectic pace of life, not only add more experiences but also learn about the local culture where it's located. People who has journey to new places, will apprehend the way of local people live more than people who never go there. Ċ To begin, arguing of people, says that explore somewhere new and you can see the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs of a particular group of people at a particular time, and it will make you respect with the diversity.  Every place has different civilization, that characteristic will make the citizen easier to recognize, for instance Boti village as a traditional village in East Nusa Tenggara Province has  welcome ceremony to new visitors, where the visitors should eat sirih pinang with the King as a evidence that visitors are welcomed to visit. Traveler who knows range of culture will make him/her more honor and proud to be the person who ever got the experience. Ċ It is no surprise with the people who only stay at home. They may know the news, culture from television, internet or magazine, but not feel the atmosphere if they do not go it place and experient the truly situation. For example they watch in television about culture in Boti village, after it they will forget as the time goes by, it contrast if they visit the place, they will know what it's like and remember trough their lives. At least, visiting unfamiliar place will be the unforgettable moment. Ċ Consequently, travel can help us appreciate other cultures. However, make effort to do so, and we will more respect each others."
9833,"Some people think that it is a waste of time for high school students to study literature, such as novels and poems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is some objection against studying literature who thinks that it is such a time-consuming subject in high school. I totally disagree with this opinion, which I believe that not only reading or writing novels and poems could improve skills, it also helps the students to identify what their turn-ons are and what are not. Ċ The main reason why I argue with mentioned opinion is that studying literature could help the learners to develop their reading and writing involved skills. When people spend enough. time to read every day, subsequently, they could have the ability to read faster and understand the texts better than those who do not have that habit. The same thing happens to the writing skill technique, the result in being benefited by reading poems, novels, etc. is that students more could learn some vivid examples; hence, apply them in their exams to get more points. For example, research has recently shown some that if people man does not spend time reading or writing for quite a long time, he will start to lose his skills and it takes him doing longer to complete something that literature involved. Ċ Another rationale for my argument is that while the teenagers are still in high school and being taught literature, they could soon realise what subjects are their strong points. As a result of realising that, the students’ concerns in choosing majors for college and university have been significantly reduced. Therefore, their chances of enrolling in majors that fit them are increased. For instance, in Viet Nam, after 9 grades of studying all subjects, in grade tenth, the high school learners are asked to pick a type of class containing subjects that truly fit them. As the result, they could already identify their ability in each subject. Ċ In conclusion. I am convinced that there are various significant reasons to believe that literature is compulsory for all grades below university. I believe that it is a positive step to encourage the undergraduates to try their best in every subject as they are noticeably beneficial."
9834,"Ielts writing task 2: Many things can influence the academic achievements and emotional growth of a student. In this regard, peers have more of an impact than teachers do. To what extent doypu agree and disagree with this opinion?","Nowadays, whether the academic achievement and emotional growth are affected by students or teachers is a subject of debate. In my opinion, I firmly believe that fellow classmates have more of an influence than teachers do. Ċ To begin with, students may improve their academic performance by competing among their peers through learning process. Every students have a desire to outperform classmates and try to make an effort so that they can receive higher academic achievement, which makes them stimulate their motivations. For instance, students who study the same English materials in class may try to practice more exercises and learn new vocabularies by heart so as to get considerble scores in an English exam, which makes other students feel motivated to try their best. This demonstrates that competing plays an important role in enhancing students' academic results. Ċ On top of that, peers may have influence in developing emotional feelings by growing relationships among their friends. Children may spend a large amount of time on playing and talking with their classmates, which makes them control their inappropriate behavior in class. For example, students have a discussion about Vietnamese history by sharing ideas and knowledge in a teamwork according to teacher's requirement so that they can catch on it clearly. As a result, they will control their temper and get on well with other fellow classmates. This states that developing relationships by spending time on playing and talking with classmates is for children's emotional growth. Ċ In conclusion, peers play an important role in improving their academic achievement as well as growing their emotional feelings."
9835,Distance education delivered via the Internet or television has more advantage than classroom-based education. Do you agree or disagree?,"Some people prefer distance education to classroom-based education because they believe the former approach can bring more benefits. I am opposed to this opinion. Ċ Those who are in favor of distance education may base their argument on following reasons. Firstly, information delivered via the Internet or television is as much as that in classroom with regard to the main content of the subjects. Communications through instant messaging tools are so smooth today that students will not miss any words or scenes due to long distance. Secondly, such kind of class is more convenient to have, both for teachers and students, who do not have to go out of their doors and travel a long way to the school. Finally, the cost of education can be greatly cut down because both parties of the education do not have to pay for transportation and facilities in school. Ċ However, I believe that traditional method of teaching in the classroom can make education more productive. This is because the interaction between teachers and students arranged in the classroom are much richer in forms. For example, some science experiments are supposed to be presented through smell and touch rather than vision and hearing. Since the transference of these two senses via the Internet is still unachievable today, such kind of class can only be delivered in the classroom. In addition, classrooms are more likely to give students a sense of group, where they will feel more motivated to compete and co-operate. Students who are educated in such environment will be more proficient in socializing skills. Ċ In conclusion, although distance education has many advantages, we should not abandon classroom-based education for the sake of them, because the latter approach is more practical and effective."
9836,"Thanks to low-cost airlines, many people can travel abroad. Ċ What advantages and disadvantages do tourists bring to the countries they visit?","Nowadays, the tourism industry has been developed significantly as a result of more affordable transportation alternatives. Yet, there remains a controversial debate as to whether the overall efficiency of this possibility is beneficial for the nations or can provide detrimental consequences for them. This essay will discuss this topic from both sides of view. Ċ Firstly, a higher trend of tourists is defined as more financial prosperity for the host country. This is an indisputable fact that more visitors to a tourist destination can provide a higher flow of wealth to that place. As a salient example, the locals will be able to sell more products and souvenirs to the arrivals, while it can flourish living standards in the zone considerably; also, the rate of crime will be decreased noticeably as well as more safety will be provided in the area. Consequently, gaining a more stable economical strength for the habitants has been addressed as the primary positive point associated with higher tourism potential. Ċ On the other hand, the cultural shock has the prominent capability to negatively influence the aimed region. Considering the fact that some countries have particular ethical codes as well as religious beliefs, not respecting these boundaries can lead to fundamental issues for both sides. In addition, Islamic countries such as Iran established some basic regulations for the visitors to use veils in public places or prohibit them from drinking alcohol; meanwhile, breaking these rules will be punished severely which will not be appreciated in international terms. Hence, the differences that existed in some regions are known as the foundations of a country, which can not be problematic on the condition that they show appropriate respect toward them. Ċ In conclusion, I once again reaffirm that the higher rate of travellers can provide a vast number of benefits and drawbacks for the targeted nation; however, I strongly believe that its advantages outweigh its cons. Also, As a recommendation, following laws and regulations by the arrivals can be the most logical concept with no negative phenomena for them."
9837,Some people think that children of different abilities should be educated together. Other people think that it's better to teach the intelligent children separately and with special treatment. What do you think? Use your own ideas of knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.,"It is commonly known that successful education act as precursor to future career growth. Different approaches and methods of teaching have been applied to develop education system in order to find out the best way to cultivate children. Whereas some believe that children should learning as a group, others advocate that individual specialised education based on personal aptitude might be a better solution. Ċ The degree to which individual education is beneficial to child education can be measured in several ways. Children are likely to show their talents in their early childhood, which is easily spotted by their parents. For instance, strong interests in playing piano or other instruments are usually being found out in some famous musicians' childhood. Customised musical education therefore could be a better education to children rather than wasting time on the other areas. More importantly, children who are learning with interests and aptitude are likely to succeed in the future career as they are highly motivated and being educated in the right direction. Ċ On the other hand, many argue that generalists are important to the development of society, thus general knowledge are needed to each person. Interactions and communications are likely to take place for better knowledge grasping if children are learning together. Due to different abilities owned by individuals, a child who has a better acquisition of knowledge tend to help others who have difficulty in learning. Personalities like being caring and communication skills therefore can be cultivated in this situation. Ċ To conclude, group study along with specialised education according to children's abilities would be a better approach of teaching. Not only could children gain benefits from group study environment, also personal requirements could be met."
9838,Some people say that now is the best time in history to be living. Ċ what is your opinion about this? Ċ what other time in history would be interesting to live in?,"Well, most of the public claim that the current era would be an ideal period of enjoying life in history. I disagree with this statement due to some reasons which will discuss in the forthcoming paragraphs. Ċ Firstly, if present-day compares with previous one, no doubt population live comfortable, they have enough gadgets to make things easy and simple, but it doesn't make as that simple which public actually want. It puts an extra burden on the crowd to get success and workload. As a result, 90% of people live their life under pressure and depression. For example, a man works for a company, he needs to finish his work at the moment and manages his personal life as well. Even technology gives so many things to decrease the workload but to some extent, it fails. However, people lived their activity without any tension because they didn't have much competition at all which folk faces now. Ċ Secondly, society feels the internet or other electronic gadgets make their growth easy but, they don't know, it creates a gap between them, they have no time for their loved ones to spend with them. In a recent survey, American researchers show even living in joint families 80% of family members are unable to share their feelings with their partners. For instance, everyone uses Facebook and other social apps and are talking to people for so long even without knowing and meeting them but, they don't take time for their families, whereas, in old days, the population didn't have such luxury, even though, they lived happily. Ċ In conclusion, although folks have everything to live luxuries life, it doesn't mean that they are happy enough. Materialistic things give only comfort but, happiness needs time and care which was shown in old times."
9839,"Some people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable. Ċ Discuss this view and give your opinion.","Researchers define physical punishment as the use of force to control or change a behaviour. Some people think that physical force is a good idea while others believe that it should be banned. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support of the latter view. Ċ On the one hand, corporal punishments can be effective to stop misbehaviours. For instance, due to the fear of being punished, children are respectful and stay more concentrated on their goals. They are also encouraged to get excellent academic performance at school. Moreover, children after getting punished will think twice before doing something bad. Even so, psychologists find that these children may deal with mental issues when they get older. Ċ On the other hand, it is important for the kids to feel safe in their learning environment. In addition, children learn from their parents. So people who use physical discipline may be teaching their young children to solve conflicts with physical aggression. Also, this kind of discipline may cause the children to tell lies in order to avoid punishment. To reduce corporal punishment, adults need to remain calm and communicate in an appropriate way to get it right when a child misbehaves. For example, the elders should explain their preferred behaviour understanding the fact that children are too young to know what is right or wrong. Ċ To conclude, although physical punishment may work in some ways, I strongly believe that it can create an atmosphere of fear and we should focus on more positive approaches to discipline."
9840,In some countries younger people are neglecting their right to vote. Ċ What problems does this cause and what are some possible solutions?,"As the number of younger people who are neglecting their right to vote is increasing, such a trend is having a direct impact on their future. Such particular age groups believe that their votes don't matter and that nothing will change from their vote. This essay will discuss both the problems and possible solutions to resolve such a matter. Ċ First and foremost, there is a significant impact on society derived from such a trend that's becoming increasingly alarming. This is because not participating in votes means that they're not taking a part in making their future better. For instance, many countries consider votes from young individuals essential as they are the ones that will have to live with the choices. Consequently, society as a whole has to bear the consequences of electing the wrong leader. Ċ On the other hand, there are possible solutions available to individuals in such age groups. This is through encouraging and giving benefits to voters. As an example, giving some sort of benefits in terms of job employment opportunities to individuals that voted may help increase the voting rate among such age groups. As a result, as a lot of graduates struggle with job employment opportunities, they will participate in voting to earn the benefits. Hence, measures like these can help combat this issue. Ċ In conclusion, the problem associated with decreased number of younger people neglecting their right to vote is serious and incontrovertible.Nonetheless, with the aforementioned suggestions, the issue that people are currently facing can be solved to some extent."
9841,"These day, people in many cities know little about their neighbors and do not have a sense of community. What do you think are the causes and what solution can you suggest?","A growing number of people who live in cities know little about their neighbors and do not have a sense of community nowadays. In my opinion, these problems are caused by the reasons including longer working hours and increased job pressures. This essay will discuss the main causes of these problems. On the other hand, it will suggest solutions to these problems including building more public facilities and organizing more social activities. Ċ People are working longer hours than ever before. At the same time, they have more job pressures. As those who live in urban areas are always facing intense competitives in the workplace, they completely focus on their work rather than interact with their neighbors or stop to see what is happening around them. For example, it is reported that many high-income people tend to work more than 15 hours a day. In addition, some people never take their annual leaves. As a result, people living in urban areas have limited time to keep in touch with their neighbors and lack a sense of neighborhood. Ċ In order to solve these problems, building more public facilities and organizing more social activities are both critical. These could provide people more chances to spend time with other people living in the neighborhood. Meanwhile, it is a great way for people to disconnect from their day to day routine. For instance, a recent survey reveals that many local authorities have a plan to build public facilities like parks, sports centers and playgrounds for the local residents to relax. Therefore, in order to create more chances for people to socialise, enough public facilities and activities would be necessary. Ċ In conclusion, in today's fast-paced world, more and more people are becoming less social and lack of community sense. This essay discussed how these problems are often caused by long working hours and intense workplace pressure. This essay also suggested that the solutions to these problems are twofold: to create more public facilites and to hold more social activities."
9842,People often do not interact with their neighbours and this is harming communities. Ċ What are the possible causes and solutions?,"In recent years, people tend to live their own lives without sharing it will surroundings, especially with neighbours. Some people are of the opinion that not communicating with them harms the communities. Due to the fact that there is mainly a personal side of this issue, there is a plethora of solutions that can be implemented to unite the inhabitants of a particular living building. Ċ Every human being and family value their individual freedom and prefer to be undisturbed at their private home. Moreover, this leads to the fact that every human being has its own distinct traits compared to others and also communication abilities. For instance, it the building there might be too curious people, who want to know all the gossips in everyone's lives, whereas others are pretty shy, who prefer peace and quite style of life, this is a simple example how different might be one individual from the other and it is mostly sure that they are not going to find a similar interests for making a friendship. Ċ However, this problem with a slight optimistic desire can cope with it. For example, workers, as a house manager, can determine this community issue by organizing a variety of weekend leisure activities on the street or in the nearest park to the particular living building. Besides, they can make a picnic, to make a barbeque and to relax all together. In this way, cohabitants will definitely become to communicate with each other and make relationships for the entire life. Ċ In conclusion, each problem has a solution, clearly, if people have a desire to alter the unformed friendships between neighbours. Furthermore, does not matter how different we are from each other people should always cooperate together for an essential results in different fields."
9843,Air travel only brings advantages to the rich people. But the majority of people do not benefit from it. To what extent do you agree?,"Currently, people have more disposable income to spend on travel. As one of favorable travelling transportations, planes play an irreplaceable role as it provides people convenience. Under this situation, some people are worried that air travel will become a priority to the wealthy lie in the sky-high price. From my perspective, a great member of average people could still get benefits. Ċ Admittedly, the rich people can select the first-class in the plane. It is commonplace that a plane is divided in three different parts according to different equipments and services. The wealthy people have more options to determine their journey in comparison to the poor who have limited money to take the economy-class. Ċ However, it takes equal time for all the people in different classes to travel by air. Even though less comfortable can be felt, a large amount of average citizens could enjoy the time-saving and efficient travel by plane. Therefore, the arrangement of a plane appeals to various people from different works of lives instead of restricting in a few rich people. Ċ On the social scale, the boom of air travel will provide more job vacancies to youngsters. Every year, there are numerous graduates struggling in looking for jobs under stiff competitions. With the prosperity of traveling, individuals tend to find jobs easily and gain the ability of supporting themselves. Ċ To conclude, the advantages of air travel belongs to all the people, regardless of the fortune. Apparently, more people will be attracted by plane if the price will be lower."
9844,"Illiteracy is still a serious problem Nowadays, many people cannot read or write. What problems does this cause? What measures can governments take to solve these problems?","It is noticeable that people's literacy has been improved significantly since the existence of educational system. While most inhabitants are capable of reading and writing, there are still a number of residents who can not. I would argue that one principal factor is responsible for this tragedy, and many things should be done approriately to solve this issue. Ċ From my perspectives, when people could not read or write properly, they would be more likely to have difficulties noticing and understanding their surroundings. One of the most crucial factor contributing to the illiteracy is poverty. Children, who deserve to be educated, lose the chance to go to schools if their families do not have enough money to pay for their necessities and their kids' school's fee. Consequently, many of pupils and students have to drop out of schools, to earn their livings from physical occupations. Illiteracy is unavoidable, and a community full of illiterate residents is created with lots of concerns. Ċ There are, however, policies which national and local authorities can adopt to enhance these matters. For a start, resources should be allocated to provide basic literacy in local colleges or social and community centres to help people learn to read and write. Secondly, charity campaigns should be held to donate money to poor and remote areas so that they can pay off their daily basis and debts. This is prone to the presence of students at classes, as they will not have to work to earn their wages anymore. Finally, governments in developing countries should implement policies and strategies to ensure that everyone has the rights to pursue a basic education which enables them to broaden their knowledge. Ċ In conclusion, although illiteracy is a serious problem, our society can curb this issue by adopting and implementing proper plans and policies, to help the illiterate read and write."
9845,It is often considered that change is more beneficial to people than trying to avoid it and have everything remain the same. Do you think advantages of change outweigh the disadvantages.,"Changing is a law of nature and in every sphere of life, changes take place. Therefore, it is believed that change brings positive aspects in people's lives and rather than avoiding, people should welcome it. In my opinion, variation is far more beneficial than its drawbacks. Ċ There are numerous merits to adopt the development namely, multiple opportunities and personal growth. Because the advent of modern technology makes it possible for the human being to work anywhere around the globe as an online and offline business are more popular and people's positive attitude towards this massive shift could allow them to explore the more and more work opportunities. Also, the new trend of migrating to other countries in a search of a better lifestyle helps the people to grow as a person as one has to face several challenges while staying outside their comfort zone. As a result, the chances of personal growth could escalate. For example, in this tech-savvy era, people are earning money through internets such as Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Thus, to adapt to modern change has several positive sides for the person, which are otherwise impossible if people decline the transition. Ċ In spite of the various merits of advancement for the people, there are a few disadvantages of it as well. Firstly, it will lead to cultural extinction as due to the impact of modernization, the vast majority of people are getting influenced by western culture and consider their own cultural heritage obsolete. Secondly, due to getting indulge with new innovations, people may lose their identity. Because it is seen that influence of mass media drags people to the detrimental habits including drugs addiction, robbery and so on. For instance, while living in foreign countries people in my home country have been considering the western culture and totally neglected their background ethics. Overall, the threat to one's own culture and personal identity are few negative consequences of fast-paced shift. Ċ In conclusion, the idea to consider the accelerating pace of modernization has a positive impact on the person and society as a whole by providing the numerous offers and the chance of personal growing. Though, its demerits need to be considered; however, the small losses which could be mitigated are worth the gains it offers."
9846,overfishing of the world's oceans threatens many species with extinction and putting the livelihood of millions of people around the world at risk. What are the causes of this problem and what can be done to prevent it from happening?,"It is undenied that nowadays, many ocean species have to confront to the risk of extinction due to the human over-fishing throughout the world. There are a number of undoubted reason causing this issue and each problem needs to dealt in a particular way. Ċ It is likely that one of the most prominent cause giving rise to this problem is the sharp increase of demand for some kinds of seafood and the considerably enlarged market comparing with before. In addition to that, the innovation of fishing exploiting techniques are now leading fishermen to pick up a lot of fish in a catch. For instance, some fishermen often use dynamites or electricity in fishing to have a fine batch of fish. As a result, the more fish they catch, the more dangerous species of the ocean world have to face to. Ċ Eventhough this issue is more and more significantly raise all over the world, there are some realizable solutions to copw with this phenomenon. Firstly, we have to solve the original root of this problem by providing alternative forms of livelihoods for people living nearby the sea. By that way, fishermen do not have to over-exploit the ocean resources and turn oceans become exhausted. Furthermore, the government should educate widely the society on how dangerous over-fishing could effect on ourlives. Ċ To sum up, people are now more interested in using seafood and some products from seafoods than ever before. Therefore, it is resulting in the issue of overfishing of the world's oceans. However, governments could use their authorities to solve this problem effectively."
9847,"Couple global or multiple local languages? Learning English at school is often seen as more important than local languages.If these are not taught, many are at risk of dying out.  In your opinion, is it important for everyone to learn English? Should we try to ensure the survival of local languages and, if so, how?","Recently, there has been an on going debate on whether learning English is as important as learning local languages and should we make effort to preserve the existence of local languages. From my perspectives, English as well as local languages plays a crucial part in many aspects in the near future. Ċ English has its own reason to become a compulsory subject at school. Mastering English, students can increase their chances of further education as they wish to study aboard. It can also improve students' job opportunities in the future career. Moverover, English plays an important role in globalization. In the near future, sections such as the world's economy or cultural exchange will mainly used English as a means of communication between countries. Ċ However, it does not mean that local languages are no longer necessary to learn. We should ensure the survival of these languages to maintain cultural diversity.. Additionally, these languages are still part of some community in the world. In order to save these languages from extinction, we could publish books or make documentaries about the local languages and the government should make these languages a compulsory subject at school too. Ċ In conclusion, English and local languages have the same importance in the language education as well as cultural diveristy and globalization"
9848,"As countries become more developed, many fast food outlets move into the country giving local people greater access to fast food. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","The residents of different nations are able to have fast foodstuff in their streets due to the establishment of these shops around the world. This essay believes that the benefits of this outweigh the drawback. The essay will demonstrate how this type of cuisine is beneficial in the fast-paced era and then the detrimental effects of having unhealthy cuisine in our lives. Ċ To begin with, the main advantages of fast foodstuff industries are not only helping to fulfil human's requirements but also deliver a variety of meals at affordable prices. To elaborate further, with access to these facilities in various part of the world the jobless society get the opportunity of employment. As a result, the rate of unemployment could be decreased. For instance, a survey conducted recently by BBC News has revealed that 35% of the world's population are working in fast-food industries. Moreover, the working-class people depend on these cuisines owing to a shortage of time. They can have numerous tastes with cheapest rates and attractive offers placed by cafeterias and eateries. Therefore, these shops help to maintain communities and individual's living standard. Ċ Despite these advantages, it can never be denied that there are negative effects of opting to fast food places. Firstly, this kind of meal impacts the community especially children's mental and physical well-being. Consuming sugar, salt, fat, sodium and so forth could be the cause of obesity, heart diseases and a low supply of vitamins and proteins to the mind. Secondly, these cuisines satisfy a person's hunger for a short period rather than for long hours. This habit can be influenced by an individual's economical condition negatively. For example, several employees squander 17% of their income on purchasing street foodstuff during weekdays in a month. Hence access to fast-food restaurants globally also brought health diseases and affect folk's budget. Ċ To conclude, Jobs opportunity and managing a person's schedule in the busiest lifestyle are major benefits of this trend. However, consuming these meals within a limit can overwhelm the negative sides. Thus, I believe that the availability of fast-food industries has more merits than demerits."
9849,Should there be any restriction on how many years a teacher may teach the same subject or grade level? Explain your answer.support your opinion with specific example.,"There is a great deal of controversy among educators whether or not teachers should be restricted to teach the same subject or grades for a certain number of years. Some might argue that by teaching the same stuff repeatedly, teachers will be bored and their teachings will be monotonous. Others believe that a well experienced teacher is a boon to the community. After careful thought, I believe that teaching the same subject or grade level for several years is certainly beneficial for the students. Ċ In general, the more experienced the teacher is the more is the academic achievement of the children.Teachers become thorough with the subject because of the repeated teaching for many years.Since its important for students to enjoy learning, these teachers with their expertise can make classroom time fun,exciting and easily understandable.For example when a teacher talks about solar system in classroom,the experience will enable to easily explain it with models.They might use a flashlight as a sun and a ball as the earth.This scenario might not be possible with a teacher who does it for the first year. Ċ Moreover, being in the same grade level will make them understand the kids better.It gives a clear perception about the particular age group and how to handle issues,behavioral problems associated with that age group. A kindergarten teacher will know better about a kindergartner than a fifth grade teacher. Better understanding and guidance from the teacher will consequently let the children achieve their full potential. Ċ Ultimately, I believe that several years of teaching of the same arena or grade is definitely good for the students. Teachers can update their skills.. by attending workshops and training sessions. Thus experienced and successful teachers will challenge and inspire our children to achieve."
9850,Q: Some think that computer games are dangerous for children in every way; others think that computer games help children's development. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Nowadays, computer is playing an increasingly pivotal role in children's education. However, an issue whether computers games are harmful to children or not came to people's mind recently. As far as I am concerned, views on this issue vary from person to person. Before giving my opinion, it is quite indispensable to look at the argument on both sides. Ċ People, who support that computer games are dangerous for children, giving some following reasons. To begin with, children may learn some violence from computer games. As far as I known, some popular computer games are full of violence, which will drive the crime rate. For example, if children argue with some others and have no effective measures to solve it, they may fight with these people. In additional, computer games will influence children's study. Children spend more time on computer games, so they are likely to have not enough time to focus on academic assignments. Ċ Those, who advocate that computer games help children's development, have their sound reason. Computer games can help children to improve their mental development. With more contact with computer games, children can some experience that how to win games . After playing computer games, they will summarize some certain methods to win games. Thus, it is helpful for children to become more intelligent. Ċ From my part, I want to take a balanced position. There are both advantages and disadvantages to computer games.. When children want to relive the academic burden , children can play some computer games. Parents should take the responsibility to supervise their children in order to make their children not play overly computer games."
9851,What could be done to encourage people to buy local products? Ċ An increasing number of people are buying what they need online. What are the advantages and disadvantages for both individuals and companies to shopping online?,"In the current scenario, more people prefer to buy products for the needs, through online instead of going to the store. This essay is gonna explore the advantages and disadvantages of both the options, and will give the possible ways to encourage more people to buy local products. Ċ To begin with the advantages, buying from online stores are more convenient when compared to offline stores, for instance, a dress can be ordered through online, by just clicking from our phones. The new generation shopping provides the customers to select from a wide range of products. While, individual shops do have its own advantages, these stores provide the touch and feel features of a product, these features are important while selecting an object. For example, If a customer is buying a bed, he needs to experience the comfort and feel the bed, in order to decide, and this can only be given by offline stores. Ċ On the other hand, purchasing from online do sometimes cause problems to the buyers, such as, when the object is delivered, it might have a different colour and size from the pictures seen in the phone and might even be faulty. This is caused because, these shops do not have the option to touch and feel the product. In the case of real shops, products in these shops are more expensive and does not provide a large range of collections to choose from. To add, these a shops do not have discounts to attract the customers. Ċ To conclude, more number of people are buying from online and lesser offline, these two options have itof a thing, of it; possessive form of ""it""its own advantages and disadvantages. In order to encourage people to buy local products, these products should have better quality and should be cheaper when compared to outside products."
9852,Topic: More and more people ignore basic science today. What are the causes and what are your solutions?,"The time since the first industry revolution witness a high-speed development in economy around the world, which emphasize the importance of basic science. But recent years, it represented a negative tendency that many people, the number of which is still increasing, ignore basic science study. I think the following reason would account for such phenomenon. Ċ For one thing, because those subjects have been developed hundreds of years, many of them constitute a wide range of knowledge which is extremely abstract for the majority of people. As a matter of fact, Calculate was a superior knowledge, which, whereas ,is used as a common tool in others courses now. Moreover, everyone is human with limited time and energy, therefore, it is hard for us to absorb all the cream of each subject, as we have plenty of courses to learn. As time passes, people may lose the confidence and interest in it. As a consequence, the basic science would receive less attention than before. Ċ For another, we live in a society where a lot of attractive things such as internet, television program and computer games are around us, so it is difficult for us calm down and concentrate on a certain basic science like our ancestor. Besides, the government even never provide a convenient circumstance for people to approach to basic science. Ċ To change this situation, what we should do is that adjust our attitude and pay more attention to basic science. In addition, the government must take a certain finance to encourage the research of basic science. Only in this way, can we copy the booming of both academic and economy hundred years ago."
9853,"In a recent survey conducted in this country, it was found that up to 20% of twelve year-olds in some schools were showing early signs of nicotine addiction. Ċ In the eighteen to twenty year age bracket the percentage was as high as 70%. A large contributing factor to this high level of addiction is attributed to the uncensored TV advertising of cigarettes. Ċ For this reason all cigarette advertising should be banned. Ċ Discuss.","Nowadays, the western world faced a crucial problem with harmful advertisement and the consequences. In regards to such a commercial, there is a dramatic change happens in adolescent lives. Moreover, Smoking issue among the teenagers is the major part of the crucial issue. This essay is going to examine the facts more closely. Ċ To begin with, the fact that smoking cause health problems is widely admitted. As a result of using cigarettes, people get lung cancer or heart diseases. Also, such diseases are more and more common in adolescents, due to the fact that they started smoking at an early age. Another supreme reason why cigarette advertisement should be banned is the government spending on free treatments. In other words, treatment of the consequences of cigarette consumption is quite expensive and the state allocates a lot of money annually. Due to this, other important areas such as transportation or education receive less money. Ċ However, there are some possible solutions to this problem is the increased awareness of teenagers. Thus, children will be less amenable to peer pressure and TV advertisement. For example, special classes at least once a week with specialists could radically increase the teenager’s awareness. Another, perhaps, a good solution is the government should cigarette impose tax higher to reduce demand and cover the cost of treatments. Furthermore, if the price of cigarettes will be too high, teenagers would not be able to afford it. Ċ To conclude, TV advertising of cigarettes is a crucial issue with political implementation. Especially in the country where so many young people are addicted to smoking. However, possible solutions can be made to reduce the number of smokers in general."
9854,Today’s teenagers have more stressful lives than previous generations. Ċ Discuss this view and give your own opinion. Ċ Give reasons for your answers and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is often argued that youngsters these days suffer more stress than people in earlier times. Although today’s teenagers have to cope with a lot of stress, I believe that their stress level does not exceed that of those in the past. Ċ There are several reasons why adolescents are said to feel more stressed than their ancestors. First and foremost, they are in competition with their peers not just in their academic performance but also in social status. When it comes to sitting an exam, they have a burning desire to outperform their classmates as their future prospects are going to be dictated by those results to a certain extent. Secondly, apart from parent pressure, they have to keep up with their schoolwork. They have to make commitments in extra-curricular activities as well in order to win popularity among friends, which leads to excessive stress. This means that they do not have enough time for their hobbies and relaxation. Thirdly, social media magnifies social comparison in today’s modern consumer society, which results in growing stress. For example, when teenagers cannot afford pricey products like iPhones or PS 3, they are more likely to come in with anxiety and depression as they would not get the attention they desire. However, that pressure was not that intense for the community in the past as they led a simple life without access to any information about how other people were living. Ċ On the other hand, the fact that teenagers are going through a difficult time does not necessarily mean that older generations didn’t experience lower levels of stress. People in earlier times would have faced stressful situations in order to meet the basic needs and support the family because there were not as many job opportunities in the past as there is today. Furthermore, if only simple machinery had been used in industry, they would have relied heavily on physical labour. As a result, it would have been stressful for previous generations to work in massive production industries. Some workers might have had to work in unsafe environments such as construction and mining. In addition, due to limitations in internet access and transportation as opposed to today, getting the mails and products delivered to the clients in time would have caused physical workers high levels of anxiety. Ċ To sum up, young people feel under pressure as a consequence of competition, a heavy workload and social comparison but their stress level is not stronger than that of earlier generations."
9855,Some people think that it is good for younger people to make their own decisions. Others feel that these decisions should be made with the help of their parents. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion,"According to a few people, allowing teenagers to make their own decisions is upright. However, many others, hold an opinion that parents must help their children in making these calls. Personally, I believe, adult interference is required as they make a right call because of the added past experience, at the same time, these youngsters are extremely vulnerable to come to an efficient decision. Ċ Consequently, experience adds an immense insight into the human thought process which assists them to incorporate different possibilities in making the right choice. By parental support and help, they can analyse and derive the available options and with the knowledge received, they can excel in opting the right one. For instance, being an adult, they have seen and surpassed all the obstacles that their next generation is currently going through, which helps them understand the circumstance better. Therefore, parents must participate with their young one's, to take an appropriate path. Ċ On the other hand, due to the sudden growth in hormonal and physical changes, teenagers are overly vulnerable, especially in unpredictable situations. Rash and instant choices could be made, due to lack of exposure towards different scenarios of life. For example, in countries like the United States and India, the percentage of accidents in young people are hurt and arrested are particularly high, proving the vulnerability of their mental capabilities. Hence, authorizing these young one's to choose their path in such a fragile state of mind is not appreciable. Ċ To conclude, in my opinion, parents must take a step forward, interfere and help their kids in providing a proper perspective towards different possibilities of the chosen solution, through the knowledge gained from their past occurrences, as these youngsters are lacking a proper insight yet, and are extraordinarily unguarded without it."
9856,"In many countries, the widespread use of internet has given people more freedom to work or study at home instead of traveling to work or college. Does the advantage outweigh the disadvantage.","In recent times, the usefulness of the internet can not be overemphasized worldwide. Many individuals are of the opinion that internetCorrect article usagethe internetIt seems that article use may be incorrect here. Ċ show examples is beneficial as it gives people the liberty to work or learn from their houses and not necessarily embarking on a journey to their offices or schools. Admittedly, it makes life less stressful. Nevertheless, despite this advantage, it has a devastating disadvantage as a poor network can be a major challenge. Ċ   On the one hand, many individuals think that the use of the internet makes living easier as we can work from home and even have lectures online from anywhere. This is because we have the privilege to stay in our comfort zones and enjoy controllable environmental conditions. For instance, during the COVID 19 lockdown, all students were forced to stay at home to hold classes, study showed that the students' success rate increased by 35% due to the fact that they had little stress and thus, had more time to read. However, in spite of this, its disadvantage outweighs the advantage as no activity can be performed on the internet if the network is bad. Ċ   On the other hand, some people including myself believe that working or studying from an individual's residence can be disadvantageous especially when the cyber is faulty. It is due to the fact that there will not be any form of connection to the other end when there is a weak network, thereby preventing learning and working processes. To buttress this, in research carried out at the University of Lagos, they found out that 75% of the nursing students missed the first three lectures when an online class was put on a trial due to bad network coverage. From the aforementioned example, it is apparent that the downside of the use of the internet to study surpasses its positive effect. Ċ   In conclusion, the usage of the internet provides people with the opportunity to perform their jobs and study from the house. The disadvantage supersedes the advantage as a poor cyber will disrupt any activity online. Therefore, virtual classes and work should be encouraged."
9857,Many people believe that riding a bicycle is still the best way to get to places. What are the advantages and disadvantages to using a bicycle nowadays?,"The bicycle is one of the most important vehicles for individuals to move around in cities. In the present day, some people argue that riding a bicycle is the best option to reach locations. This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using a bicycle. Ċ Firstly, the main advantage of riding a bike is to save money on transportation. Many people need to move around from place to place and this costs a huge amount of money if you go by private car or another paid method. As an example, a car requires fuel, maintenance, and insurance to be able to run and take you wherever you need. Also, buying a car can be very expensive for many people who only receive an average salary. Moreover, there are other positive impacts on health and in the environment if you only ride a bike. For instance, individuals who ride a bike every day can consider this as a way of workout, helping them to get in shape. In addition, if people ride a bike instead of a car, they will not produce greenhouse gases. This means that they will impact positively the environment. Ċ On the other hand, there are some drawbacks on riding bikes. For example, if you ride a bike in the streets with no specific bike lanes, there is a risk that you can be hit by another vehicle. This means that you can suffer injuries, because of places with no safety traffic for bikes. Another disadvantage is the harsh weather conditions on rainy days. Many countries and cities have this condition for a long time in a year, which means it is very difficult for bike riders to commute or get to places without wetting themselves. Thus, if you only ride a bike, it will become hard to leave home for work or leisure on rainy days. Ċ To conclude, there are positive impacts on riding a bicycle. Mainly in money savings but also for the environment and people’s health. However, riding a bike can be very difficult in places with bad weather as well as dangerous in the streets with no safe lanes."
9858,Unemployment is a growing problem all over the world. What are the causes of this? What could be done to help tackle this issue? Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement?,"In the ultra-modern era, it is a fact that, unemployment is seen in each and every corner of the nation. An increasing number of people are facing the dilemma of illiterate throughout the globe. This essay will early of all examine what had led to this happening and a few visible solutions to handle the mentioned-situation. Although some people say it is beneficial, I do not think it is necessarily the notion. Ċ It is the earliest of all essential to understand about why the people not getting studied is a growing issue. The earliest point is that, poor life style. This is owing to the fact that of poverty, individuals cannot examine which make them jobless. In the UK, to give an epitome, there are some areas: Greenwich, Islington and Angel, Brent; where people are not able to inquiry because of poor lifestyle. To mitigate the mentioned trouble it is necessary to enforce government to introduce the mandate regarding application. By this it meant that if authority put the strict case about education, people will have to follow it. For example, In Japan, there is a statute about the investigative purpose that all the individual has to course up to 18 years compulsory, so all the people over there are well employed; as a result, if this severe statute is initiated then the dispute can be resolved. Ċ There are, however, a few reasons, which says that it is not necessarily the case. The early reason is that, unemployed is not in all over the nature. This is owing to the fact that in a metropolitan area where we cannot see the unemployed rates, so it is not all over the nature but in some part of the globe. In India there are some urban areas: Mumbai, Banglore, and Dubai; where all the people are well educated; therefore, what I mean by that is, it is not necessary that all the earth are growing their obstacle as of unemployment. Ċ In conclusion, Even though there are some trouble and few remedies of the given situation, I believe that it is not vital to say that it is significantly growing all over the earth."
9859,"Assignment: Do memories hinder or help people in their effort to learn from the past and succeed in the present? Plan and write an essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading, studies, experience, or observations.","Memories are something everyone has. Whether they are painful or pleasant each person has a past. The difference is what is done with it. Many believe that the past is irrelevant and mustn't be brought into discussion, however memories can be powerful and life changing. One's past is part of that individual and must be embraced with respect. Ċ Understanding what has past is a significant step towards comprehending the present. That is the very reason our society teaches history in its classrooms; once it is understood we can begin to grasp the complexity of modern society. The same is true with human lives. The past must be remembered with care because it shapes individual lives. Ċ Furthermore, the past also holds the ability to teach. When people reject their past they are truly rejecting themselves the opportunity to learn and to grow. To evaluate a previous mistake is become empowered with antidotes against committing the same offense again. Ċ In conclusion, memories hold strong influential power, and when used correctly that power can successfully enable an individual. They have the ability to teach and mold one's life. One's past must be treated with utmost care and worn with intense pride."
9860,"In many cities there is little control on the design and the construction of new homes and office building, people can build houses in their own style . What are the advantages and disadvantages of this situation","There is no denying that, in modern times, the predominance of civilization in each and every aspect of our lives has been significantly increased and due to its influence, the younger generation is complaining about not having sufficient control while designing and building own houses and offices. However, others opine that we should follow the government construction policies and obey the guidelines. I completely agree with the latter statement and in this essay, I will support my view with examples. Ċ On the one hand, the major disadvantage of not allowing people to design their house is limiting their imagination and architectural skills. When we decorate our home, it represents our way of thinking and our cultural values. If we have a similar pattern throughout the area, then it losses beauty and identity. For example, In India, many people live in small flats due to the lack of space, but through their creativity, they have enhanced the look and feel of their place and It does bring positive energy and promotes their art. Ċ On the other hand, although, having the same theme can demonstrate equality among the citizens. For instance, It will be easy for a rich person to build a fancy apartment, but at the same time, others may prefer to invest their money in savings. Additionally, following a single theme can improve the view of a place. There are many tourist sites in the world, which are famous for their oneness and that fascinates the crowd, thus it can be helpful, in order to grow the tourism sector of the country. For example, In Greece, In a certain region, only white colour is allowed and now that place is worldwide known for its uniqueness. Ċ In conclusion, despite there being good arguments in the favour of people claiming that we should have the freedom to plan their living area, I strongly believe that the pros outnumber the cons and we should accept the government's strict fundamental regulations."
9861,"strict punishments for driving offences. Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reducing traffic accidents. Others, however, believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","People have different views regarding the lesgitation on road traffic about whether imposed severe punishments or other methods have a noticable implication in the accidents rates. In my opinion, the former would be justified, however the latter sounds more convincing. Ċ On the one hand, It is evident that the implementation of strict punishment such as fees and probation are actually affect to driver's awareness. To be specific, penaties act as a deterent for reoffended trend, which in turn preventing driver to repeat the unlawful act. Moreover, harsh punishments gain social endorsement in terms of controlling juvenile crimes. For example, those who are disregrad the law can have a life-lesson if they are condemned. Ċ On the oher hand, there are others measures can be adapt apart from strict punishment which avoid crime motivation by dealing with the insight cause. One of them is improving the education standard, by that I mean, to cover students with adequate traffic theoretical knowledge and pratical skills. Subsequently, governments or local councils could reduce road accidents by investing in better public transport like bus and train in case of driving incapability in drunks. Ċ In conclusion, although strict punishments play a vital role in the decrease of driving criminal rates, those solutions analyzed above will eliminate all elements that include a person to embark on law break, which cover wider than the previous idea and is predicted to solve thoroughly the problem in the foreseeable future"
9862,Question:  More renewable energy sources are harnessed to generate electricity these days. What are disadvantages and advantages of this trend?,"More electricity produced that using for now it comes from alternative energy resources. It has advantage and disadvantage. While the cost from using new energy source will be higher since it is the newest. Beside that it would be many choice for people  in the future to use it will lessen the dependance on fossil. Ċ New energy bring the positive way for using but the cost will be more expensive. It is because the equipment and location is uncommon. For instance, geothermal energy in near the mountain is need much money to drill in the location and expertise to do the job because too many risk for finishing. In addition maintain the energy source yet need special equipment that the usage to distribute the energy around the area. It need investation for long term period. It is true that people should earn much money to use the energy. Ċ In the future, people can use new energy and not depend on the fossil energy. It means they would reduce the number of effect from fossil energy such as gas emmitions. For example, survey from Ministry of Mineral and Energy Resources state that 50% of using the Geothermal energy would be decreased the number of pollutions in air. People are more likely to choose the renewable energy since it has many benefit for them. Ċ To conclude, the renewable energy give the positive impact but the cost for using it is more expensive than before. However people have many option for energy using in the future."
9863,"Some people think that all the lawbreakers should be taken into the prison, while others believe that there are better alternatives. (for example, doing some work or learning some skills in the community). Discuss both views and give your opinion.","According to a set of individuals , persons who do not obey the rules laid by the constitution should be sent to the police station ,whereas, others opine that instead of arresting them,there are some other ways to teach them the norms like allowing community work etc.,The following paragraphs will outline both the viewpoints and place my opinion. Ċ On one hand, the reasons given by the people who say that lawbreakers should be sent to custody are as follows.Firstly, taking these individuals to the police station will make them come out as good human beings.For example, prisoners are made to work for themselves and are paid in jails.This way a burglar can understand how hard is to earn money and will never try to do that again in his entire life.Secondly, the interpersonal skills they learn as a part of prison life will make them realise their capabilities and they perhaps can start earning after coming out.For all these reasons, I opine that sending a wrongdoer to the police is the best way. Ċ On the other hand, some persons in the public believe that making the criminals suffer in front of the local public will make them realise their mistake and feel the guilt very soon.For instance, by making the thief who entered a community to make theft as a watchman can install a sort of responsibility in him and visualize his mistake.Besides this, some persons rob because they are not educated and they do not have another source of income.By helping these individuals by teaching them art or skill can make them earn a living and stop doing robbery again. Ċ To conclude, both the masses produce valid reasons for their opinions .However, I feel that sending the lawbreaker to prison is the right way to make him know his mistake and thus instil fear in him so that he can never attempt any unlawful act in his life once more."
9864,More and More students are moving to foreign countries for higher studies. Do you think its advantages outweigh its disadvantages?,"In the contemporary era, the vast majority of students require to study abroad for earning a higher degree. I strongly believe that overseas learning can provide great positive outcomes, while some argue that it is unnecessary. In the following paragraphs, the many reasons for supporting my opinion will be discussed in this essay. Ċ Increasing the number of students who want to study abroad has been significantly obvious. This is because most people believe that this might provide an opportunity for high-paid jobs in the future. In addition to this, pupils have a chance to learn other languages and the diversity of traditions in many countries. For example, Asian students who graduated from UK universities can communicate fluently in English, particularly in British accents, and learn the principles of problem-solving from developed countries. Ċ On the other hand, overspending overseas is one of the biggest demerits. It is generally acknowledged that studying abroad has high costs apart from education such as plane tickets, rented rooms, and diet. Even though this is a worthwhile investment, some families face financial issues, affecting household spending and elevated debts. For instance, in national universities, pupils could save money by living with their parents, which is cheaper than overpaying in foreign states. Accordingly, families do not take a loan and have enough funds to invest in other ways. Ċ In conclusion, the advantages of being international students outweigh its disadvantages. Although there are paying more money for almost everything in daily life, the governments allocate many scholarships for good result children."
9865,"The government should ban smoking in all public places, even though this would restrict one's freedoms. Ċ Do you agree or disagree.","Smoking in public has always been a contentious issue. Governments around the world have introduced limitations or outright bans to public smoking, while other authorities have adopted a more lenient attitude towards it. Some believe that restrictions on smoking in public infringe on individual freedoms, but I disagree with this idea. Ċ First, it has been a well-established fact that smoking is very harmful. It is one of the leading causes of lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases, and it remains a public health issue in developing countries. Introducing a ban on public smoking can limit opportunities to light up, and can be an indirect incentive to quit smoking altogether. For instance, smoking can be a social activity where smokers gather on a table and light up while chatting, drinking or watching a game on TV. Some may argue that such a ban is a restriction to individual freedoms, but I do not believe that anyone is free to indulge in harmful activities to themselves. Ċ In addition to this, smokers do not harm themselves only when smoking. Second-hand smoking is a serious public health problem that can be directly addressed through restrictions on public smoking. For example, children, the elderly, and people with asthma can suffer from the effects of inhaling second-hand smoke, especially as the smoke coming out of the tip of a cigarette is unfiltered, therefore they may inhale even more toxic fumes than the smokers themselves. This alone is a good justification to introduce bans on smoking in public, as nobody is free to risk the health of others. Ċ To conclude, I think that smoking in all public places should be banned, because not only do people who smoke harm themselves, they jeopardize the well-being of others as well. No one is free to hurt others or themselves in different ways, and I believe that the same logic applies to smoking as well."

How can we deal with those causes ? main causes of the criminality rise","Criminal activities have risen all over the world in past few decades. This essay will discuss the main reasons for the former statement, and it will provide the possible solutions for those reasons. Ċ It is undeniable that most of the criminals in contemporary world use advance technological methods to their activities. Most of the crimes occurring in the present-day related to online fraud. Moreover, these online criminals not only trying to steal the money of the people but, they are after the vital information of other people and countries. For instance; founder of the wiki-leaks website arrested due to accessing and stealing vital information of popular people, and countries, over the internet . Ċ Furthermore, many people have died over the past few years due to gun fires. Most of the western countries, citizens can legally obtain weapons from the shops; whereas, in developing countries, gangster groups acquire these weapons illegally. Consequently, they use these weapons to kill their enemies, rather than solving problems legally or peacefully. Ċ However, most of these crimes can be avoided if the governments make rules and regulations to punish the criminals. In addition, if governments banned the weapons for the public; it will be really beneficial for the safety of the citizens. Most of the developing countries do not have rules and regulations to act against cyber-crimes. Ċ In conclusion, the increasing crime rate worldwide has alarmed everybody. Cyber-crimes and weak rules and regulations are the main reasons for this. However, governments can control this situation by introducing new rules and regulations."
9867,"Right now, many countries are exploited remote areas for more resources. Do you believe the advantages of this action overweight its disadvantages?","Nowadays, remote areas are exploited for more resources in a host of countries. It is convinced that disadvantages of this phenomenon prevail over advantages of it. Ċ Undeniably, in most countries, exploring remote places can assist in solving the scarcity of both natural and power resources in short term. For instance, there are many treasurable resources in remote fields, oil and natural gas can be extract from seabed. Besides, this practice could offer more job opportunities and help unemployed individuals to support themselves. Ċ However, it is manifest that the exploration of resources in remote places can negatively impact the sustainable development of a nation. Specifically, it leaves no resources to next generation by exploring all potential sources and utilizing all possible traditional resources. It is more crucial for us to use resources more effectively and efficiently, while to develop high technologies to collect renewable sources. Additionally, although more jobs are create, it is inevitable for workers to be isolate from others, such as friends and families, which would indeed harm mental health. While, working conditions could be tough and there could be unpredictable accidents which would post threats to employees' physical health. Ċ In conclusion, granted, the exploration of resources in distant places could bring some merits, the problems attended by are more significant such as hampering sustainable development and harming workers' well-bing. It is convinced that the drawbacks of this phenomenon are outbalanced."
9868,Tourism is causing environmental problems all around the world. Ċ What are the main causes of this? What are some solutions?,"One of the root causes of the deterioration of the environment is tourism. This is mainly because of exceeding commercial flights and improper ways of throwing trash which is done by tourists. There are a number of solutions which should be implemented to cope with these issues. Ċ Firstly, toxic chemicals released from commercial flights which are primarily used by the tourist industry are making global warming worse yearly. Many studies show that chemical reactions which trap carbon dioxide in the ozone level are byproducts of commercial flights. Tourism is the primary sector which utilizes aviation to transport passengers. Although it does not directly influence the rise of sea level, it is a reason for airlines to operate, which is, unfortunately, destroying the planet. Secondly, inappropriate ways of dumping junk are also creating problems for local tourist sites. Take Ha Long Bay as an example, garbage which is thrown away by visitors is stuck in numerous rivers, which has exterminated fishes and birds in surrounding areas for years. As a result, ecosystems have become unbalanced in many tourist sites. Ċ There are two effective solutions to deal with environmental problems caused by tourism. One way to tackle this is to limit the number of annual commercial aircraft which can enter a country. This method will surely reduce the amount of unfriendly environmental chemical produced by aviation. Hence, the negative impact of using planes to transport passengers will lessen. Moreover, another method of dealing with disposing of litter improperly is to implement heavy penalties. This solution would hopefully deter sightseers from taking any chances to get rid of unwanted items recklessly because they will pay a bunch of money if they get caught by the authority. Ċ In conclusion, imposing a restricted number of tourist trips and rolling out fines for dumping aimlessly are effective in dealing with environmental problems stemming from tourism. If governments implemented these solutions, the environmental impact would be decreased."
9869,"Some people prefer to travel around town by car, while others prefer public transit such as bus, train, or subway. Ċ Discuss both these positions and give your own opinion.","It is an irrefutable fact, that people need to move from one place to another. The use of transportation to visit down town in populated cities is an important topic. The following up paragraphs will analize this situation. Finally, my personal opinion will be given. Ċ First, the use of automovil, every year is increasing all around the world. The reason is that traveling by car is quicker and more confortable. Also a saving of time. For example: In my city, which the density of population is high, if individuals go to town by car they will not need to waste time waiting for the bus, at the same time they have to travel with a lot of people. This is sometimes unconfortable. Ċ Second, by the other hand, using public transportation can contribuite to reduce traffic jam. Most of the ocassions, there is a problem when, in town, a lot of automoviles are going to the same place. In addition, cars produce air contamination, and also sound contamination due to the claxons. In specific hours, for instance when children finished their day at school, generally around 1:30 to 3:00 pm. Streets are fullfilled by cars. Making with this, not only traffic jam, also producing stress on people walking on streets, as well as the individuals who are driving their cars. Further more, using train, buses or subway help a lot cutting out pollution. Ċ To sum up, in my personal opinion, if we want to save our planet utilizing public transportation is a need. Eventhough, people has to make a sacrifice waiting for the buses, and sharing the trip with different people. On the contrary, cars do not help the planet, causing pollution due to the use of gasoline."
9870,"Rising University fees and scarce employment prospects for graduates have led some people to say that universities should not teach arts subjects like philosophy and history, and only practical degree courses that maximize chance of employment. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Acquiring university education is an expensive business nowadays. It has led many to believe that universities should not offer arts programmes to the students because of the scarcity of jobs in these fields. The emphasis should rather be laid upon teaching the practical subjects that help in finding an easy employment. I disagree with this statement. Ċ However, there are various reasons that make this argument beyond the acceptable. One of the most important reasons is the interest of a pupil. In other words, how can a student who is aspiring to be an artist in his future, made to learn any other science subject like the engineering. By doing this, the student will only half-heartedly apply himself in this field but will also end up as a bad professional. This signifies that the interest of the student should be the foremost factor in deciding what to study in the future rather than the employment. Ċ Another reason for universities to continue their arts programmes likes philosophy and history is that although the employment options are squeezing for these professionals, they have not reached to the point that warrants the abolishment of these subjects. For example, the number of admissions in arts subjects can be used as a reliable indicator to ascertain the popularity of these subjects amongst the students as well as their value in the job market. Furthermore, a few arts subjects, like the generalismapplying to all or most members of a category or groupgenerals, are very popular in the developing countries like Pakistan. The reporters working for news channels and newspapers are making huge money and in fact are playing a role of the ideal professional for many youngsters. Ċ To conclude, nevertheless, there are relatively more jobs for technocrats and skilful people in the market, but from my perspective, studying these technical subjects should not be at the cost of arts. It is therefore suggested that the decision whether to study art or practical subjects should rely on the interest of the student. Moreover, there is still enough room for these professionals in the job market."
9871,"For many young people today, shopping is their favourite free time activity. Ċ Why do you think this has happened? Ċ Should young people be encouraged to do different activities in their free Ċ time?","The interest in going shopping is growing considerably especially among youngsters. In my opinion, this happens because of big malls and plazas which had been built, over these years. Nevertheless, they should be motivated to do sports activities rather than going shopping. Ċ To commence, there are a lot of activities where people can go, but unfortunately, most of the young folk go window shopping to big malls where they spend their valuable time for nothing. The consequences of this habit are spearheading adverse effects. For example, by walking around, these crowd never gain enough knowledge to achieve their goals since they spend their time outdoors without concentrating on their studies. Thus, all kids ought to alter their actions to more beneficial things like playing chess or learning new languages. Ċ On the other hand, it is strongly believed that young people ought to be inspired to do more sports activities such as playing Tennis, Football or Basketball. Undoubtedly, by playing such games they will not only have fun but also they may find a new friend. Moreover, playing sport is a great habit because youngsters may get into it and define themselves as professionals. For instance, a friend of mine is a tennis player who participates approximately in thirty tournaments annually. The great thing is that He earns from each tournament plenty of money. Therefore, elders have to motivate kids to choose a good profession where they can find passion. Ċ In conclusion, there are a plethora of hobbies, but many youngsters' favourable habit is going shopping. It is very common to see young kids in huge malls where they just walk by wasting their perfect time. This happens due to the plaza's attractions. However, elders should encourage all teenagers to do sports rather than going shopping."
9872,"Summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they respond to the specific points made in the reading passage.","Recently, there has been a ton of debates as to tom’s diary. More specially, in regards to the passages, the critic puts forth the idea that the tom’s notes are not precise. In the listening passage, the lecturer is quick to point out there are some serious flaws in the writer’s claims. In fact, the professor believes that the tom’s memoirs are completely true, and addresses in details, the trouble with each point made in the reading text. Ċ First and foremost, the columnist of the reading states that tom was not a rich man because Swiss merchant lent him numerous amounts of money. Moreover, if he was a wealthy guy why he will borrow wealth?. Some professionals in the same field, however, stand in firm opposition to this claim. In the listening, for example, the professor states that he was a rich man. He goes on to say that he spent his cash on entertainment stuff and his income came from selling goods, thus, let him borrow salary from the Swiss merchant, besides, he will pay back for him. Ċ One group of scholars, represented by the reporter thinks that the conversation was not accurate because they are wondering how he will remember what the author and he was talking about after many years. Of course, though, not all experts in this field believe this is accurate. Again the speaker specially addresses this point when he states that he wrote the conversation right after it's done and he kept it in a place, then, when he wants to write his book he goes back to his notes to write exactly what happened between him and the writer. Ċ Finally, the author wraps his argument by positing that his story about his escaping was wrong and he was building relationships between the workers in the jail. Not surprisingly, the lecturer takes issue with this claim by contending that there are many prisoners had good relationships with the workers and there are still in prison. Additionally, there is evidence trend that his escaping story is true because when he escaped the government rebuild his roof again. Ċ To sum up, both the author and professor hold conflicting views about tom’s book. It’s clear that they will have trouble finding common ground on this issue."
9873,Some today argue that schools are no longer necessary because children can learn so much from the internet and be educated at home. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The internet has made the world small, even our classrooms have shrunk into online meetings. It is the opinion of some people that traditional schools are no longer required since the internet offers a myriad of resources. They argue that homeschooling is better. I strongly disagree with this view, I feel that kids need to have a proper school setup. I 'll describe the reasons for my view in this essay. Ċ First of all, educating kids at home is not an easy feat. Obviously, youngsters have many distractions in the house. For instance, many youngsters nowadays own gaming consoles, prying the controllers away from them and making them study instead, is a huge task. Secondly, not everybody is qualified to educate their children. They are either unaware of how to teach or busy with their own work. One clear example is, if both of them are working, they will find it strenuous to spend time teaching and checking the progress of their kid. Ċ On the other hand, the convenience that comes with educating the child in the house and a false sense of security of having the kid around all the time, are some reasons why parents consider this approach. Indeed, the child is safer when at home and parents taking an active role in teaching is easier than sending the child to school. Consequently, the youngsters will miss developing the important social skills they need to be good citizens. Ċ In conclusion, while there are some advantages in educating children at home with the aid of the internet, there are many disadvantages to this approach. While people supporting homeschooling cite convenience and safety as their main concerns, there are counterpoints to this, like kids growing up without social skills, parents who are not qualified to teach and distractions in the household. In my opinion, education from the house cannot be considered as a replacement to school."
9874,Many children nowadays are spending more and more time inside rather than outside. Is this Ċ a positive or negative trend? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your knowledge or experience,"It is often said that these days many children prefer to spend time in their own accommodation instead of going out. From my point of view ,it can be a negative trend. I'm going to explain some reasons below. Ċ Firstly , one of the main reasons for this argument is becoming isolated. For example ,in most countries all around the world where we can see high_quality technological gadgets ,children are spending a lot of time playing video games as well as watching their favourite programmes on TV. Needless to say ,this situation could create many problems such as the lack of communication with other people. Additionally ,to stay at home scions will suffer from some mental disorders. Therefore ,this makes it clear why it could have a deep detrimental impact on the public. Ċ Secondly ,another reason is becoming disabled to build a good relationship with others. For instance ,someone who spent noteworthy moments at home during his childhood will face multiple troubles to enter society. Moreover ,creating interaction with his classmates and colleagues will be difficult. These causes can persuade the population who live in the world to stop consuming moments indoors always. Opening the doors and watching the world can help to have an extrovert personality and using imagination can be more effortless. As a result ,it becomes apparent there are numerous reasons behind each claim that we can not ignore. Ċ To summarise , I personally believe spending time at home can be harmful to a child. It is predicted that to continue this activity by offspring they will be faced many physical and psychological problems in the near future."
9875,Computers are being used more and more in education and so there will soon be no role for the teacher in education. To what extent do you agree or disagree? machinery cannot dominate education,"In the age of modern technology, there has been immense advances in technology in most aspects of lives, particularly education. Many people are of the opinion that one day teachers will be obsolete in the classroom. I affirm that educator's position is irreplaceable in this area. Ċ Some people hold a belief that the role of teacher in the classroom starts to fade, giving place to computers for several reasons. First, there are a number of fundamental subjects which are able to be taught by computers. Pupils can do assignments and get answers easily using computers in some areas such as maths and languages as these subjects only require students to memorize the information through a process of repetition. As a result, programmed-computers can provide a multitude of questions and answers to students to handle with. However, this hinders the interaction between students and educators. Ċ All things considered, teachers still play a pivotal role in the classroom. Firstly, teacher can instruct and stretch students how to analyze and synthetize information efficiently and then give them appropriate feedbacks. Meanwhile, a computer is not adequate to evaluate mistakes or provide expanded concepts which are essential to enhance students' learning proficiency. Secondly, teachers can support students to develop other vital skills. A prime example is that through classroom activites designed and monitored by teachers, students can foster their critical thinking skill, creativity and team-work performance. Besides, teachers create motivations by honoring the academic achievements of the students. Ċ In conclusion, technology will not bring the best values into education system if we marginalize the role of teachers. Education is a crucial mission that machinery cannot dominate in any time. It would be much more efficient for us to use a computer with the teacher's guidance in the classroom."
9876,"It is often said that the subjects taught in schools are too academic in orientation and that it would be more useful for children to learn about practical matters such as home management, work and interpersonal skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In these days and age, it is argued that educational courses put excessive emphasis on academic aspects based on reliable material resources, and the young learners should be educated about practical points that have versatile applications in their lives, including household management, work and interpersonal skills. From my perspective, children can gain comprehensive development by incorporating theoretical and practical education. Ċ To begin with, the academic curriculum is a crucial element for the development of the students in some specific fields in the future. This can be explained by the fact that college, university, or higher education courses require deep academical knowledge. In addition, theoretical knowledge in educational training has been proved by the academic experts plays an essential role in our daily lives as well as our work environment. For instance, an individual who is able to apply the formula and handle a challenging situation with his academic knowledge can get approval from the supervisor. Ċ On the other hand, practical training is required to handle situations in life and the work environment. Due to the fact that we cannot avoid collaboration to solve the demanding projects or problems, which requires communication and the teamwork spirit of each member, individuals who acquired good practical skills will be appreciating. Furthermore, people with good practical skills can get a better chance to move up the career ladder. To illustrate, besides the experience and knowledge, businesspeople or leaders in teams need to have some practical skills to complete their tasks. Ċ In conclusion, both theoretical and practical educations are vital for the all-inclusive of the children since they are in school. Therefore, I strongly encourage to bring the direction or the lessons of the practical skills into the academic materials for the young learners."
9877,Do you believe that self-driving cars will become common in the near future? Why or why not? Ċ Support your answer with reasons and expamles from your own knowledge or experience.,"Vehicles that do not require human control are known as self-driving cars. Perhaps because of their convenience, cars with auto-steering wheels will become more prevalent in the near future. However, I am not quite convinced. Ċ To begin with, the most crucial benefit that autonomous vehicles provide is safety. According to the statistic, human error is to blame for over 90% of traffic accidents, an issue that self-driving cars will solve. Robot automobiles, unlike human drivers, are not easily distracted, do not fall asleep behind the wheel, and do not travel at dangerous speeds. As a result, having more self-driving cars on the road means fewer collisions. Furthermore, these vehicles have the ability to use GPS to find the fastest route, detect delays and accidents. This not only results in faster trips, but it also reduces emissions, which are largely generated by automobiles stuck in traffic. Ċ Using cars without human adjustment, notwithstanding the benefits listed above, has its detractors. One major downside is that the convenience of self-driving cars for individuals may lead to an increase in the number of vehicles on the road. This undoubtedly adds to traffic congestion. Furthermore, a fully autonomous car, in my opinion, would require the ability of a human to recognize and predict the behaviour of various things on the road. A pedestrian or a cyclist, for example, behave in a variety of ways that are often unanticipated. Ċ To summarize, therefore, self-driving cars are becoming closed in our life, but I sense a normal car is always a reliable choice."
9878,Men do most of the high-level jobs. Should the government encourage a certain percentage of these jobs to be reserved for women? Ċ What is your opinion on that? Ċ Use your own knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.,"Interestingly, most of the prominent jobs globally are executed by males. Some individuals think that the authorities need to interfere for categorising a certain percentage of these jobs to females. In this essay, I will discuss the merits and de-merits of categorising certain jobs for women and explain why it cannot be a good solution. Ċ In fact, there can be a lot of disadvantages of reserving seats for the ladies. Firstly, by setting aside places for the ladies, the deserving male candidates could lose their position, which could result in de-stabilising the organisation. Further, it could disrupt the transparency of the organisation. For example, it is widely known that the most of the global MNC's and government organisations do not have any form of reservation for keeping their system transparent. Secondly, by keeping aside seats for women, the lower skilled woman is getting engaged compared to their higher skilled male counterpart, which could result in the effectiveness and functionality of the institution. Hence, reserving seats for ladies can never be a great solution. Ċ On the other hand, there are a lot of advantages that can be gained by not setting aside seats for women or any other category, for that matter. It could not only bring skilled people to the upfront, irrespective of their gender difference, but also can bring about transparency and effectiveness in the work world. For instance, it is an accepted fact that people who are highly engaged with important tasks needs to be the ones who clearly knows how to devise strategies to implement it and have worked their way up. Additionally, by not reserving positions, it can motivate employees to work harder and reach the topmost position, which could drastically benefit the productivity of the company. Ċ To conclude, in my opinion, there are a lot of de-merits of reserving positions for women. Seats needs to be filled as per the market demand and the skill of the employee, rather than providing a platform for all genders to participate equally that could result in the disruption of the work culture."
9879,Some parents believe that learning maths at school is redundant and should not be taught. while others believe that it should remain a foundation subject. Discuss both (1)views and (2)give your opinion,"Nowadays, according to some parents teaching mathematics at schools is not relevant in this modern era. But some other parents have the opinion that maths should be the fundamental subject in educational institutions. In this essay we will discuss both views in depth. Ċ Firstly, it is natural for some parents to believe that maths should not be a curriculum anymore in the educational institution because of the increased development in technology. Furthermore, almost all the mathematical calculations can be performed through either computer or electronic calculator. For example, As per the study conducted by the university of Cambridge revealed that 85% of the working professional in customer care strongly agree that mathematical calculation learned in school is not practiced in their daily life. Hence, many parents strongly agree that, subject maths shall be removed from the student's syllabus. Ċ However, every coin will have two sides like supporters and opponents. There are parents supporting to continue the traditional method of teaching maths in the schools since it is believed that mathematical calculation improves the students’ metal thinking capability. For instance, it is evident that people learning Abacus tend to excel in their aptitude-based exams. Owing to the reasons, Parents want their children to learn maths as part of the academics. Ċ To Summarize, Whether or not, it is always essential to learn mathematics in context of the situation. But sometimes it is also imperative to utilize the benefit of technology for complex calculations. In my opinion, advanced mathematical calculations shall be removed from the early schooling and the same can be availed for higher education as an option based elective subject."
9880,mostly people are becoming seriously overweight ? some say that rising the price of fatty foods will solve this problem . to what extent do you agree or disagree with the essay.,"People are hardly anxious about their health at present; as a result, an abundance of individuals are becoming obese. the folk claim that inclines the cost of junk foods items may assist to overcome this dilemma . This essay will discuss adopting other solutions that are more fruitful rather than increasing the amount. Ċ population believe that upsurging in the rate of fast food is the only solution to make the community fit and healthy . society disburse their money on essential needs rather than spending on packed foods that are perilous for them . For instance , surprisingly, most of the youngsters are consuming unhealthy meals even they know that it is detrimental to their health and put pessimistic effects on their development . Besides, the fatty meals would be avoided by personages that assist them to save some money . Ċ Conversely, there are various efficacious methods that are beneficial to deal with this problem: education and outdoor activities. Populaces should be aware by the government of the pernicious effects of packed food and provide knowledge through seminars and educational campaigns about following a healthy lifestyle. To illustrate, on the 21st of July, India celebrates yoga day, on that day regime motivates people to perform yoga in the morning. In addition, folk need to perform outdoor activities like yoga, running and physical exercises, which are entirely necessary to remain fit and reduce their weight; albeit, homo sapiens have a hectic schedule, they rarely focus on physical activities, which leads to an unhealthy lifestyle that affects their physical development. If the public focus more on physical exercise, it supports controlling their weight and prevent them from detrimental ailments. Ċ To summarize, this essay argued that increasing cost is not an appropriate solution because children are obsessed with fast food . Therefore, it is clear that the idea of increasing the cost of junk meals cannot be supported. in my opinion, providing rigorous knowledge is sufficient to guide the generation about a healthy diet and healthy lifestyle ."
9881,"Throughout history, people have dreamed of living in a perfect society, but they have not agreed on what an ideal society would be like. Ċ What do you think is the most important element of a perfect society in the modern world? Ċ How can people work towards achieving an ideal society?","Humans are always in search of a new world even though they are blessed with ideal living conditions. It is observed that everyone is after something better than what they have and a perfect neighbourhood is one of them. In my view, establishing colonies that are human friendly is a continuous journey. In the next few paragraphs, I shall explain the same. Ċ To begin with, owning a house or a flat in a world that is equipped with all possible infrastructure and amenities is a blessing. For example, buying an independent villa in a gated association has added advantages like an in-house swimming pool, playgrounds, clubhouse. These facilities help the persons living in a community to not step out of the community for basic requirements. Jogging tracks helps folks to build relations and meet their neighbours regularly and keep their health fit. An ideal world is a sum up of all basic requirements so that any human need can be quickly accessed. For example, a hospital with a doctor can help the population to avoid visiting nearby towns and save time and lives. Ċ On the other hand, it is not so easy to build a decent society. It requires careful planning and execution. Common facilities like water, electricity, schools, playground, groceries stores, medical shops are the basis for establishing a living community. Further, setting up educational hubs, public transport, parks, hospitals should be the top priority of any government to ensure the people living in the newly established towns or cities have access to basics. Growing trees, reducing noise and air pollution when establishing a living society. For example, one sect of the society of the people want to have a temple in their town and others may demand solar power to reduce pollution. Ċ To conclude, everyone should think with an open mind and draw a mutual conclusion on establishing a nice neighbourhood. In order to establish ideal societies, we all should think from a big heart and nothing is impossible with time and agreement."
9882,"With increasing populations and ever-growing urban centers, many countries are losing natural beauty spots. Ċ What benefits are there to protecting places of natural beauty? Ċ How can this be solved?","It is true that the world's population and urbanisation are rising dramatically and the natural beauty spots have been destroyed in most countries. I believe that there are several positive outcomes to protect these areas and this can be tackled with some steps. Ċ There are a number of advantages to the protection of nature. First of all, these areas are crucial tourist attractions, which can boost a country's economy, and also the nation's pride and identity. For example, Cappadocia is one of the famous natural beauties in the world as well as associated with our country, Turkey. Besides these advantages, many various species live there, which can provide a natural habitat and balance the biodiversity. Hence, these places are also peaceful for local people to enjoy. Ċ In spite of the above benefits, taking immediate actions can solve the losing natural spots. Firstly, laws could be imposed on industry to not allow near the natural beauty spots. Secondly, people can be encouraged to live in rural areas and given more job opportunities. In addition, governments should take stricter control of these spots to ensure protection. Finally, city residents can be educated about protecting the environment and if those do not follow the rules, harsher punishments and fines would be effective. For instance, school children could be learnt about the importance of natural beauties and the environment as a lesson. Ċ In conclusion, although human habitat is growing and spreading to every part of the world, protecting natural beauty spots should be priorities for all countries because of the numbers of benefits. Governments should be more strict about protecting the environment."
9883,"Some TV programmes, video of violent games and other leisure activities are harmful for children. How harmful they are? What can be done to solve these problems?","Children can easily access to different kinds of entertainment thanks to the development of technology, however many can negatively affect their development. In this essay, the reasons why entertainment activities can be bad and measures to reduce them will be discussed. Ċ Watching or playing harmful contents or games will probably have impacts on youngsters because they can learn inappropriate behaviours quickly. Firstly, teenagers may watch movies related to murderers and obsessed with them, which leads to a higher chance of committing crimes. Secondly, they often copy actions that they have seen so youngsters may repeat activities on movies without being aware of their misbehaviour. For example, students could bully their classmates because they found the action was cool on TV. Finally, teenagers may addict to the media and lost focus on studying. In fact, in some countries, there are rehab centres dedicated to game addicts and most of them are in young ages. Ċ To prevent these problems, there should be a corporation between different parties. Parents and schools need to control the stuff that children have access to. For instance, parents need to set up parental controls on their children's computers so that they do not spend too much time using them. Furthermore, they may block websites that have adult or violent contents to prevent their offsprings from accessing them. Also, the authorities may help to solve the issue by banning harmful sites before they reach to the citizens. Moreover, there can be 'Internet police' who will report and block any potential risks. Ċ To conclude, children may be affected by TV shows and video games they consume so different measures are needed to prevent their access to those contents. It is not only parents' and schools but also the authorities' responsibilities."
9884,"Although there is a lot of software available today that can translate from one language to another, it is still necessary for people to learn a foreign language. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Nowadays, with the help of computers and smart devices, translators are able without delay and errors to translate from one language to another. While some people believe that it is enough for the modern person to have the application, I would argue that learning foreign dialects is mandatory for every person since it helps individuals to feel confident abroad. Ċ Firstly, using equipment for translation has enhanced face-to-face communication between people. However, a huge number of issues will happen if the application misunderstood the spelling of one’s dialect. For example, such languages as Chinese and French are concentrated on sounds and spelling and, therefore, one word can have different meanings according to the pronunciation. In fact, each software devices can occur error and it is vital for people not to rely only on the application. As a result, individuals should learn foreign speeches if they want to be understood correctly. Ċ Secondly, learning local speeches has a significant effect on the academic level of the student or scientists. Likewise, if any student who wants to pursue its education from an international university cannot rely on translators to complete the studies. To illustrate this, for any student applying to a university to pursue tertiary education it is mandatory to provide the proficiency test of the language medium. Ċ In conclusion, during the age of modern devices, it seems that learning of foreign language is a waste of time, due to beneficial technologies that can fast and quite correct translate the information. Nevertheless, despite cutting edge technologies, learning is always beneficial for mankind to survive in a country where everyone uses a local way to communicate with each other."
9885,"Topic: Technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in the world today. Given time, technology will completely replace the teacher in the classroom. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?","In today's world, the use of technology is ever increasing. Even in classrooms,technology can be commonly seen.It is disagreed that technology will completely replace the real teacher in a classroom. It is shown by analyzing the inability of a robotic teacher to discipline a misbehaving student in a classroom as well as a robotic teacher hindrance to the learning process of a student. Ċ To begin with, a teacher powered by artificial intelligence would have little or no control over it's students.For example,it is commonly understood that children require the watchful eye of a teacher to ensure that they are Indeed doing their classwork,instead of fooling around during class time. Unfortunately this is something that a technology driven teacher simply cannot provide. Thus,this makes it clear why technology will never completely replace a teacher in the classroom. Ċ Secondly, a robotic teacher would disrupt a student's learning process and in effect slow the ability of a student to absorb the information from the lessons. For instance, kids require motivation to be taught effectively. Such is a quality a human teacher possess but a technology driven instructor do not. From this it becomes quite evident that robotic instructor will never take the place of a real teacher in a classroom. Ċ To summarize, a robotic teacher lacks the discipline needed to instruct students properly and actually operates to retard the student ability to learn new information. Thus it is clear that why the idea of having a classroom run entirely by a machine is not supported. After analyzing this subject,it is predicted that the negative aspects of the debate over computerized teaching will forever be stronger than the positive ones and because of this, computers will never replace teachers."
9886,Many people consider celebrities such as actors and athletes to be their role models. Ċ Do you think that people should look up to celebrities as role models? Ċ What other types of people are worthy of admiration?,"Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in public regarding the lives of movie stars and athletes. While some people think that these famous individuals are someone whom they aspire to become, I believe it should not be the case. Instead, others deserve more praise and accolade such as teachers. Ċ Firstly, celebrities may set horrible examples for people through their behaviour and language. Indeed, a considerable number of actors or athletes nowadays do not seem to mind how the general public perceives themselves. As a result, they may use crude, indecent language, or even commit illegal offences and get arrested. Furthermore, people in the limelight would promote an extravagant lifestyle. There is no doubt that these people receive enormous incomes from their lucrative businesses, and the fact that they splurge money on prohibitively expensive items and holidays is understandable. However, this may conjure up a misleading image that spending money excessively is synonymous with being popular. Fans, especially teenagers, would, therefore, emulate their idols and wasting a huge amount of money, trying to become someone whom they are not. Ċ There are indeed infinitely more people who deserve the same recognition as celebrities do, and some of them are teachers. It is true that they play a pivotal role in shaping the world’s education. In other words, teachers are the cornerstone of the future of an educated workforce. Therefore, a world without its existence would regress and result in a less intelligent society. Moreover, teachers have spent most of their lives trying to impart wisdom and foster the growth of many generations, only to be rewarded unjustly. As for their substantial dedication, teachers should be held in high regard and treated as well as other professions. Ċ In conclusion, I think people’s adoration for their idols should not turn into an effort to imitate them. Also, teachers exemplify great models to look up to, and hence they should receive the same, if not more than, recognition as celebrities."
9887,"QUESTION: Nowadays movies and computer games containing violence are very popular. Some people believe that they have negative effect on the society and should be banned, others, however, believe that it is harmless entertainment. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. ANSWER:","In today's world, there has been a tremendous development in violent movies and computer games which is favorite entertainment for everyone. However, there is a controversial premise regarding to this although some people reckon that it have affect on the community, the other tend to have the opposite opinion.

Children are attracted and addicted to these movies which result in violent behavior like aggression, conflicts with parents, fighting and delinquency. Report says that there is increase in number of crimes, murder due to psychological problems in adults and teenager due to continuous involvement in the activities.

Children will learn about the violent behavior and its causes from the movies and helps to tackle violence in their future. It is best leisure activity which helps them to get points or scores and gifts. Ċ To conclude, by analyzing both the views, it is clear that even though violent movies and computer games have significant affects in my point of view if it is used wisely for educating children about its results. They will become successful violent free future generation. Moreover, with limited access of this helps to entertain, relax and rejuvenate the mind."
9888,Longer life spans and improvements in the health of older people suggest that people over the age of sixty-five can continue to live full and active lives.  In what ways can society benefit from the contribution that older people can make?,"Cutting edge of technology has driven advanced facilities in health sector. People' life tends to be longer than even before and it argued that they are more health and active in societies. I would argue that elderly still productive in their age particularly in the modern families who concern to pursue their careers, and they also can make contribution in education sectors. Ċ In reality, most of parents spend a lot of time in working to build a stable position in a company. Ċ Women as housewives are also becoming more independent in financial area and sometimes they decides to pursue their study in a high level of education. It means that lots of time has delivered doing such careers and activities, while they have responsibility to take care their children. Having active and health grandparents will be beneficial for those women because they can help to nurture their grandchildren at home and no need to pay a service from babysitter. The elderly also can establish a close relationship with grandchildren to form family tie. Ċ In addition, being health at the age over sixty-five is still possible to teach and conduct a research even share experiences or skills for young people. Those jobs must be appropriated with them, related with advanced skills and enormous experiences that they had. This is also the way for them to keep culture still exist with telling history or playing traditional game. Ċ To sum up, people aged over 65 are still health in this modern of facilities especially in the health area. It encourages them to keep fit with many advantages activities such as supervising the member of family and contributing in education  field."
9889,Some people say that teenagers should work part-time and earn money. This way they will learn basic lessons about work and become more disciplined. Others argue that teenagers shouldn't sacrifice their rest and after-school activities to work. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"Working while studying is a controversial topic and there are two opinions about it. Although some people advocate the combination, others strongly disagree with it. From my point of view, the young should early carry out part time work when they are students. Ċ On the one hand, it is hard to agree with the idea of sparing time for two activities because studying might render students stressed if they lack time for relaxing, especially during exam period. This can be attributed to the reason that learners may have to face a heavy study load which includes tremendously complicated subjects. After spending a huge amount of time researching, teenagers should allocate their time to other resting activities which can help them avoid overstretching the nervous system. Ċ On the other hand, there are several advantages while having a part - time job. Firstly, they may learn on the job then equip themselves with some basic lessons. It is a consequence of the fact that when a student is officially included in a company, he or she will have various particularly assigned tasks. Therefore, he or she may take a chance of applying theoretical knowledge accumulating from schools into practice as well as collaborate with other colleagues to solve his/her problems. The result is that they may comprehensive the abstract theories and sharpen their interpersonal skills. Secondly, it is said that becoming more disciplined is a precious experience students may have. This result may stem from the strict assessment in the working environment which is known as KPI. It might require the young to well organize and work effectively. Ċ In conclusion, in spite of the fact that totally concentrating on studying may be supported due to its benefits, I am convinced by the opposite idea."
9890,"With an increasing number of people eating fast food, which if eating too regularly can cause health issues, some people think that the only solution is to ban it completely. Ċ To what extent do you agree Ċ ?","Numerous of people who eat junk food in fast-food restaurants is climbing up. By frequently eating it will cause some health problems. A group of people argue that the best step to solve the problem is to ban it completely. However, I also believe by doing exercise, it can help reduce the problem. This essay will discuss the reasons why banning the fast-food restaurant can solve the issues and a logical conclusion will be provided in this essay. Ċ There are some problems caused by eating too much fast food. Firstly, eating junk food regularly can cause a health problem. For instance, too much eating unhealthy food makes people gain their weight rapidly, as we all know as obesity. Secondly, obesity makes social problems. To elaborate, obesity makes people lazy to work, they only use the government's support money to buy more junk food. Ċ In other hands, by ban fast meal restaurants completely it helps people choose to live in a healthy way.Hence, no more citizen who comes to the hospital because of unhealthy food's health issues any more. For example, they choose fruit and vegetables as their main meal since they cannot find an unhealthy restaurant. This will be followed by the young generation who see examples of healthy people. Consequently, the government does not need to spend much budget for a health issue caused by rubbish foods. Ċ In conclusion, everybody can live healthy if clutter food restaurants completely banned from society. Government and other stakeholders can support this idea through positive campaigns of how important eating healthy foods."
9891,Imagine that the content of the Internet were controlled by a powerful global agency comparable to the United Nations. Explain the possible ADVANTAGES and/or DISADVANTAGES of such a system.,"The content of the Internet controlled by a single powerful global agency comparable to the United Nations would provide many benefits as well as drawbacks. Controlling internet is adopted in many countries due to its social stability, but it has its advantages and disadvantages. Ċ Censorship of powerful global agency has some benefits. Firstly, one of these benefits is that when this system is implemented, it would be adopted and accepted by all nations. In this way, all flow information, which is published or broadcasted or omitted, is being exclusively insisted to protect any disorder including cyberspace and investigate cybercrime... Secondly, powerful global agency would create community and reduce conflict between its members by the final authority of what content is permitted on the Internet. It would make equality in our constantly changing world, which has big gap between developed and developing countries. For instance, third world dependence on first world sources media programming and technologies was a sensitive political use. Ċ In contrary, the control of GPA on the content of internet in comparison with United Nations has some disadvantages. Firstly, once internet is controlled by one organization, its monopoly regulation restricted and monitored internet that meet their political requirement. Imagine that China, which was ""thumbnail"" of powerful global agency, restricted social media like Facebook, Google... For instance, both China and Russia sold other countries technology for monitoring and filtering the internet. In addition, when information is regulated, that means, there is not free exchange of information and ideas that foster collaboration and advances in science and technology. Ċ In conclusion, attempts at censorship have been mostly unsuccessful. People have free will and free thought. They have morals and make conscious decisions about what they do. I think the problems outweigh the benefits."
9892,"There seems to be an increasing number of serious crimes committed each year. While some think the best way is to use death penalty as a deterrent, many people believe that other measures will be needed. Discuss both sides.","In recent years, with the rapid development of the economy, the world has faced various debatable issues, one of which is the appropriate solution to the significantly increasing number of social evils.  While some advocate that death sentence should be applied to stop this, others believe there are some alternative approaches. This essay will therefore analyze two viewpoints. Ċ The opinion to sentence someone to death is attractive for several reasons.  First of all, capital punishment is the most powerful sentence, which may cause fear in a variety of criminals and result in a decline in the quantity of crimes committed. Obviously, there have been more and more deadly crimes against morality in this modern age. An outstanding example is the most recent terrorist attack in Paris, which took hundreds of innocent people's lives. It is therefore totally understandable that more death penalties should be put into practice to contribute to a peaceful society. Ċ On the other hand, I believe there are alternative measures that can produce the same results, however, be more humanitarian. Life sentence is one of the most effective approaches, which has been widely enforced in several countries.  For instance, when a person puts an end to someone's life, whether intentionally or unintentionally, he may then seize the chance to lead another life whilst feeling remorse for what happened in the past thanks to life imprisonment. Besides, each and every person has the right to live, which is why others should give them the opportunity to rebuild their lives rather than sentencing them to death. Ċ To conclude, I would argue that despite the fact that death penalty can bring peace to the community, other measures are worth considering due to their humanity."
9893,"Today, some young people say that their mobile phones are the most important thing they own. Do you think that popularity of mobile phones is good or bad thing?","The advancement of technology has developed the way of living, such as technology is smart phones. However, a few youth claims that this device has brought many advantages to living. From my point of view, it has more drawbacks than merits. This essay will discuss how this brings more demerits than benefits. Ċ On the one hand, from the last few years, mobile phones have opened an easy communication way. This is a type of device which can assist people to use Social Media to connect to the world, as well as making phone calls on the internet. This certainly helps people to keep in touch with their distant relatives, friends and family members. Additionally, doing any kind of professional work is possible with this spectacular gadget, for instance, Microsoft word software is used for creating documents which can be installed on our device. Moreover, this tool provides getting everyday’s news updates through news portal. Ċ On the other hand, although, this automation gives human many advantages, the disadvantages have more effect on young children. These days, the younger generation tends to addict to mobiles because they think that it is more prominent assets they have despite the side effects. Unfortunately, a survey result has shown that, people who use mobile more than average hours are suffering many health issues, namely, hearing loss, vision problem, headache, even though brain damages. Ċ In conclusion, in spite of the numerous benefits, it is responsible for health hazard; nevertheless, youngsters find it entertaining and vital for their lives. I think, there should be some restrictions for using the mobile phones."
9894,"In many countries, there is a shortage of housing due to growing population. Some people argue that new towns should be built in the countryside. Other argue for the regeneration of the cities. What are the advantages and Disadvantages of building new towns in the countryside?","Nowadays, overpopulation has altered to be a primary issue in the cities ,which resulted in the lack of appropriate accommodation. While there remains a controversial debate whether new towns are better to be constructed in the suburb or in the cities. This essay will address both positive and negative aspects of this determination. Ċ Firstly, extending domestic territory in the rural areas can develop these sites. This is an indisputable fact that erecting a new living neighbourhood in the countrysides can provide many contributions for these places. For instance, more population will flow to these locations resulting in better amenities and facilities for the habitats; also, more medical centres will be required to ensure the health condition for the dwellers that must be met since it is a vital factor for an ideal living location. Consequently, these localities will be developed swiftly with suitable living conditions for the people settled in them. Ċ On the other hand, allocating suburbs for expanding the buildings can cause visual pollution and environmental degradation. Considering the countrysides as a potential destination for the tourism industry, constructing new housing districts in these sections results in a significant reduction of visitors to them. As a salient example, if new apartments are built in the outskirts, fewer tourists will be attracted to these destinations, which can abrupt locals' income from this source; meanwhile, various issues can be introduced in these places, particularly rise of crime rate in the region. As a result, this determination can have reverse consequences for the people living in the area. Ċ To sum up, I once again reaffirm that constructing new domestic areas in the suburbs can contain both positive and negative aspects; but I strongly believe that its advantages outweigh its disadvantages. However, to reduce the total harm of these new living sites, the proposed zones must be suggested with the least possibility of harming the natural beauties in the countryside."
9895,"living in a large city or in a small town. Nowadays, young people tend to focus on big cities to live and work. The difference in population density ratio between urban and rural areas is very high. This has resulted in the creation of many mega cities over 1000 people/km2. Why do big cities have such a special attraction?","The first main reason definitely is convenience in public transportation system. In big cities, there are many bus stops and train stations in streets. The fees are cheap for people who don't afford to buy private vehicles to use. People can save money to spend on other things such as: buying houses, shopping, learning to improve themselves,... Moreover, public transportation system is safe enough for student to go to school without parents, so they can save time to do housework or any else. Ċ The another main reason that living in a large city is good is many kinds of entertainments for people to relax after hard working or studying. There are a lot of shopping centres and supermarket which can satisfy their shopping pasion. In this centres, various goods appear and are refilled everyday. Furthermore, people can join a lot of other activities such as: going to parks, going to cinemas, going to gym centres, .... They also hang out together in famous restaurant at weekend. It is interesting for young people to reduce stress. Ċ The final main reason is highly quality of life in large city. Because of development in finances of big cities, the government built many modern facilities such as: school or universities, hospitals, governments agencies, companies... People can access to fascinating job opportunities and the best educations. Children are studied in a good condition and have many dynamic environments to improve themselves. Ċ In conclusion, although living in a large city has some disadvantages, with these main reasons, this is still a good choice. However, more and more people move from rural to urban areas. We need to have some solutions to control this situation and we should join hands for better life."
9896,Some people think that governments should ensure that their people stay healthy; others think it’s the responsibility of the individuals. Discuss both sides of the argument and provide your opinion.,"It has been argued by some people that the provision of health facilities is the prime responsibility of the state, whereas some have the opinion that it's the duty of the individual to remain healthy. In my opinion, I think that the government must ensure the availability of best medical setups. Ċ On the one hand, as health is a basic necessity of life, so ensuring it's upkeep, is the prime task of a ruler, and I also support this fact. Firstly, a healthy nation can progress exponentially. Secondly, this prosperity is dependant on the allocation of budget in the field of medicine. Moreover, health department must provide hospital in each and every town along with the best advanced technologies. This, in turn, will not only keep the nation healthy but will also increase the country's GDP by ensuring the availability of work force. For instance, according to a research published in the European journal, the USA has progressed due to its spending on the basic necessity projects like medicine and education. Ċ On the other hand, if a person wants to lead a peaceful life, then he should take care of his hygiene himself. Primarily, he should keep the environment and surrounding clean. Furthermore, he should not only do regular exercise, but should also consume a balanced diet. All this will keep him fit and will increase the working capability. So, individual effort is must, to remain disease free. For example, the Japanese nation has inculcated this habit of self uplift and has emerged as a powerful country. Ċ To conclude, I believe that, every individual has the right to avail the free medical facility and its provision is the utmost task of the ruling party."
9897,"the importance of travelling into space The space travel is excellent these day, but there are many environmental problems in our planet we should tackle the problems but not travel space and spend a lot of money. Discuss this opinion.","In the 21st century, a group of people believes that travelling into space is a great idea; however, many environmental issues still exist in this planet and therefore need to be prioritized over space travel. This is understandable as travelling into space is relatively expensive. I totally disagree with this statement and so will be pleased discuss two reasons behind this disagreement. Ċ To begin with, the environmental problems these days can only be mitigated, meaning they cannot be fixed completely and that damages done to the environment are irreversible. This not at all surprising, considering that humankind has been neglecting the environment for ages, so it is too late to find solutions. For example, many species are endangered and some have even gone extinct due to certain self-centered individuals. Ċ Furthermore, the earth is approaching the sun and therefore there is no other way to avoid human extinction but to move to another similar planet. This implies that it is time for scientists to start taking these space travel activities more seriously. For instance, a group of researchers are of opinion that it is inevitable for human beings to not settle on a new planet in the future. Ċ Having discussed the importance of travelling into space, it can be concluded that environmental problems may be marginalized. In other words, space travel should be encouraged so as to increase the possibility of the survival of humankind. Therefore, I disagree with the community stating that environment problems should be prioritized over travelling into space."
9898,Advertising is influencing people more and more. Is this a positive or a negative trend? Give your own opinion and examples.,"Most societies like to buy products by watching displays. In my perspective, this trend has more positive aspects than negatives. This essay will firstly explain that how literature is beneficial for consumers in a positive way and further discuss the difficulties families can face to judge the brand before purchasing it. Ċ One of the prominent benefits of this trend is that the community can easily be aware of the quality of products which they want to buy for their daily use. For example, a person can choose from toothpaste to an electronic gadget wisely with the help of advertisements.Where he/she can compare the benefits with other similar commodities through commercial simultaneously a person can compare the costs without going to market which can save his/her precious time. Ċ Not only this, the influence of commercials makes it easy for the government to motivate the public for a positive change. Such as, the nation can be aware of harmful substances like tobacco and cigarettes via notice. To better exemplify, the Indian government has canalised an initiate to the aware families of cleanliness with the aid of television advertisements. Thousand of folk have become a part of this reform and put their hard efforts to keep their surroundings clean. Ċ However, sometimes publicity tries to make the population fool by showing false information related to things. For instance, a person can come to know about the features of the goods but cannot know about the quality likewise the quality of textile cannot be judged by watching it in pictures. But it should be in society hands that they should buy the goods after exploring them in detail without believing publication blindly. Ċ In conclusion, propaganda affects the public in both positive and negative ways. But they should be proactive before purchasing anything by watching exhibits."
9899,Some people say that schools do not do enough to teach young people about health. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is often claimed that youngsters are not taught about their health issues by educational institutions. In my opinion, I strongly disagree with the notion and I will explain why. Ċ On one hand, there are several reasons why I oppose that colleges do not instillChange the spellinginstilThe spelling of instill is a non-British variant. For consistency, consider replacing it with the British English spelling. Ċ show examples the knowledge of health in youth. Firstly, It is presumed that basic learning starts from home. Therefore, the parents or guardians must start early to impact their young ones with vital health information to keep them enlightened and aware of their body image. For instance, I remember when I was in high school, my mother had to educate me about puberty and self-identity in other to avoid role confusion and costly mistakes. Secondly, in some institutions the main objective is to prepare their students to write and pass their examinations, win in various school competitions, and gain awards. Hence, disregarding the healthy state of the scholars. Finally, technology advancement has made life easier through the accessibility of information on different platforms and mobile devices. Their level of Inquisition at the young stage would prompt them to research and surf the Internet to acquire knowledge on how to stay healthy to improve their lives. Ċ On the other hand, I believe that the academic establishment curriculum incorporates health education and physical activities. Some subjects like biology, social science being taught in the school still evolves around healthy living. Also, physical exercises are made compulsory in the learning field to strengthen their muscles and joints and make them stay fit. Furthermore, certain nutritional deficiencies are curtailed due to a balanced menu and eating habits outlined in the institute. For example, foods sold out in school canteens are prepared properly ensuring It contains the vital nutrients and in the right proportion. In addition, the hygienic state of the cooking environment is inspected regularly to avoid food poison that would cause sickness or diseases. Ċ In conclusion, I opine that knowledge about health education is impacted by universities in other to create awareness, improve muscle strength and avoid cases of malnutrition."
9900,More renewable energy sources are harnessed to generate electricity these days. What are disadvantages and advantages of this trend?,"Utilizing the renewable energy sources is favored in generating electricity. While this policy needs astronomical budget to operate, this also can decrease human's dependence on fossil fuel. Ċ It is commonly believe by the cons that the way of harnessing these newest sources invite others negative impacts such as the expensive cost spend and the advanced technology needed. For some countries, cost become the most common problem appear as it will also affect the government capability to provide the advanced technology. As the current research conducted by Japan Government shows that almost 63% of the country facing the need for renewable energy urgently is the underdeveloped countries that have not enough money to supply the research towards the renewable energy and its advanced technology. It is true that renewable energy need a lot of state spending. Ċ However, the counter party believes exploiting renewable energy to operate electricity is the only way to solve the problem of the depletion of fossil fuel. It goes without saying that the fossil fuel is slowly become extinct and the workable solution to overcome this problem is by finding another resource which has the same function to generate electricity. The study carried out by California University in 2009 showed that the fossil fuel will only appear after hundred years in the future and the renewable energy is the only alternative for human to survive from this problem. It is clear that the advantage of renewable energy is it can solve the problem of human's dependence on fossil fuel. Ċ Overall, even though the drawback impact of harnessing renewable energy to operate electricity is that some government should spent a lot of their state spending to provide the advance technology, it also bring advantage that it will decrease human's dependence on fossil fuel."
9901,"topic ;it is generally belive some people are born with certion talents for instant for music or sports and others are not ,however ,it is sometime claimed that any childern can be tought to become a good sports person or mucican . discuss both these views and give your own opinion","When becoming professional person in any field natural or born talents and proper training are the two most important tools that person become success .Most people think natural talent is the most important factor but sometimes claimed that any person can be professional person due to proper training . Ċ Firstly, born talents are very important advantage for any kid when he or she going to train it. Also for kids its easy to choose the path in there young age . Today's world have great sport person and musicians such as Roger Fedrer , Husan bolt who achieved this success in there career because of natural gifted ability .Fields like music is very important to have natural talent rather than training . Especially for the vocalist .AR Rahuman is the one of grate musician who became legend in his field because of his natural talent .

9902,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Children should not have to work or help with household tasks, their only responsibility should be to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.","In modern days, a large number of parents consider studying the sole way for their children to achieve success in life. It is commonly believed that children's only duty is to concentrate on their study and should not be required to perform household tasks. However, from my perspective, I am strongly against this idea. The bases for my view are empathy and independence building. Ċ First and foremost, doing housework teaches children how to be empathetic and responsive to others. For example, it is commonly seen that children will feel the hardship of their family members through chores and could start to help their family willingly. Unfortunately, this is something that only studying cannot offer. Therefore, this makes it clear why children should always be asked to do housework instead of just studying. Ċ The opponent of this idea might claim that studying provides all the necessary knowledge children need. While this may seem to be true at first, doing chores teaches children skills that they need to live independently. For instance, it is obvious that this will be useful at college time when children will be on their own and have to do chores themselves. Such is helpful thing that performing household tasks can provide but only studying cannot. From this, it becomes quite evident that only studying will never completely help children fulfill. Ċ In conclusion, requiring children to work with household tasks helps enhance their empathy and independence. Hence, it is clear why the idea of children's only responsibility should be to study cannot be supported. Hopefully, all parents can guide their children to be a well-rounded person with a moderate combination of studying and performing household tasks."
9903,"Some people believe that women should be able to join their country’s army and police forces, but others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion, including examples from your knowledge and experience.","A highly controversial issue today relates to whether to have feminine participation in army and police national team or not. In this essay, I am going to examine this question from both points of view and then give my own perspective on the matter. Ċ There are people who argue that the benefits of not have only men in a country’s security considerably outweigh its disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is that women, in general, are so resistant than men and they could help them much more than some man who is not motivated for some reason. It is also possible to say that we must fight for gender equality in society and believe that everyone is fighting together to protect their nation. One good illustration of this is in sports where many women are performing well than men in activities that are used well-known by men’s ability, like soccer. Ċ On the other hand, others believe that national police and army forces should not allow women to participate. It is often argued that they could not be able to improve security. People often have this opinion because in many situations women do not have the same strength that the opposite sex has due to biological's factors. A second point is that many men could show a lack of confidence in their feminine partners at first and this could create a bad relationship between both sex and segregate them. For example, although the main mission of a police officer should be to protect your colleague, they usually struggle to protect those who treat them well and show confidence in their job. Ċ In conclusion, I believe both arguments have their merits. On balance, I feel that women are able to join national’s security. This is because they are so smart and brave like men and only judge them by sex gender are not the best argument to be against their participation in our protection."
9904,Some students prefer to live on campus in a dormitory. Others prefer to live in an apartment or house off campus. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,"In life, everyone needs a place to come back after a hard day, to relax, to rest, to live. With students who are far from home, there are many choices; they can live in apartments, houses off campus, or dormitories. In my opinion, I prefer to live on campus in a dormitory. Ċ Deciding to live on campus or off campus means you are far from home. There is no rule or no one to tell you what to do, or to keep you from bad things. Hence, you need rules to make sure you are not get in troubles; because of your easy-going campus life. For example, if you live off campus in a house or apartment, you are free to hang out at midnight. However, if you live on campus in a dormitory, it is impossible to do that because there is rule to stipulate the time you can be outside. Ċ Secondly, in any society, there are many complicated kinds of people. Thus, living on campus can restrain you from meeting bad guys, criminals. Moreover, people who live on campus are your schoolmates, if you get in troubles with them; it can be solved easier than with strange people. Therefore, dormitory on campus is a much safer place to live than in an apartment or house off campus. Ċ Finally, living on campus in a dormitory is more convenient for students. For example, you can save you time going to school. Moreover, the environment of campus is more quiet and peaceful. This makes your study better because you can easily focus to your homework. If you live off campus, you can be distracted by shopping malls, game centers, pubs, or bars. Ċ In conclusion, living on campus in a dormitory is the best choice to live your campus life."
9905,"When talking about success, we often think of people who are rich or famous. Ċ In your opinion, what are the qualities that characterise a successful person? Why do you think these should be the criteria? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, if we are talking about successful people usually thinks about celebrities or rich ones. However, in my opinion, real accomplishments should not be published, so a successful human should be anyone except these people. Ċ On the one hand, the successful man should not be ordinary. He or she must develop himself/herself otherwise you will be just a regular one. For example, if you are a doctor and it does not matter which area you are working in if you are doing only basic processes, we can not call you ""a successfully"". Although, if you are searching, developing, learning, and improving yourself every day, every time and after that, if you are able to use complex techniques we can call you ""an extraordinary character"" so this should be a cautious achievement. Ċ On the other hand, being rich or famous could be a sign of achievement. You can be the best doctor or the best engineer in the world or around your area. But if you are not able to publish yourself and if people do not know about you, we cannot call you an expert and if somebody will not choose you, you cannot be successful. For example, you can be a very good veterinarian and you are very good at operations, but if you are not able to diagnose it does not matter you are a good surgeon or not. So everything should be in a harmony. Ċ To conclude about all of that, you can be a celebrity or you can be the best of your job or you can be rich."
9906,It is common nowadays for each member of the family to have their own piece of modern technology. Some people think this will lead to a breakdown in family relationships and communication. To what extent do you agree?.,"We are aware of all nations have their personal electronic devices in every family. Some parts of the community feel that this will change the family atmosphere and affect the relationship between family members. In addition, this equipment may isolate individuals from communication. It is a frequent topic of discussion that we depict this situation in our life without suspect every day. In my mind, this is a true idea about contemporary tools. But,it has also both positive and negative impacts on family relationships. Ċ To begin with, modern technologies are developing our world with their facilities and conveniences. Nevertheless, it has a disadvantage to the population's life. We frequently observe the negative impacts of these devices' on society's health and contact with their relations. Children may lose their respect for older family members and also it may separate them from the public when they fan of these tools. Ċ On the other hand, we can find more information from the contemporary pieces of equipment and also we use them in every sphere, for example, medicine, chemistry, industry and even in the education system and so on. Nowadays, every crowd have their own mobile phones and it may give them more opportunities. Even, if someone is abroad, we may talk with them without any problems and despite being long distance. Therefore, it is useful for folk. Ċ In conclusion, it is clear from these details, it has equal benefits and drawbacks to society's communication and relationship. In my view, it belongs to people's attitude to these tools and their education about modern technologies. I am concerned that these problems may appear when the population utilize these devices on a downside. In my view, we should teach people about how to correct the consumption of these electronics."
9907,Nowadays people are trying to have a successful career and happy family life at the same time. What problems could this create? How can people overcome them? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your personal knowledge or experience.,"It is commonly believed that satisfaction plays an important role in each person’s life and no one can deny it. However, in recent years we have witnessed that people have been striving to achieve success and happiness in both professional and personal lives simultaneously, and this lead to certain problems. In this essay, some of the contributing factors are going to be highlighted and possible solutions would be addressed accordingly. Ċ First of all, one of the rout reasons which may cause failure in attaining the mentioned goals is time restriction. That is to say, if anyone wants to have a happy family life, and also be successful in his occupation sufficiently, he may lack enough time. For instance, during a milestone in my life, I used to work for about eleven hours a day, and my wife was dissatisfied with the situation. In order to tackle this problem, it might be a good idea to have a more efficient schedule and following it. By doing this, the responsibilities would be established as well as expected. Ċ In addition, another cause that may give a rise to the not coincident happening of the referred objectives could be the necessity of being up to the minute continuously. In other words, not only must each person accomplish his routine job duties, but also should always develop professionally. To illustrate more, when an engineer is asked to learn the latest methodologies consistently, this might create some additional stresses on his mental health. So as a solution, the recruiters can consider certain useful classes by which the jobholders be able to improve their abilities easier. This will lead to less discomfort for the retainers and they will feel more assured. Ċ In conclusion, by considering the aforementioned reasons, it is apparent that, although problems like this exist, by taking a few steps yet practical ones, we can minimize the emerging such troubles."
9908,"For many, shopping malls are great places to spend their leisure time and meet others. People, however, in the past mostly visited those when necessary. To what extent do you think this is a negative trend?","Many families these days are visiting shopping places not only to buy things but also to be joyful with their families or friends comparing to the past where people could not decide to go to shopping centres unless they need to buy or sell necessities. In my view, I think this trend is negative for two reasons, in this essay I will outline this topic and the reason why I consider it as a negative trend. Ċ First of all, markets are not the right place for spending spare time because they are only designed to shop and consume. in other words, spending pleasure hours in nature is more peaceful and away better than being in the middle of noisy and crowded persons. for example, local parks or open green spaces are ideal places to meet relatives and friends because of the calmness that you would found. Ċ On the other hand, the main factor to consider is usually shopping malls are in limited size to match the potential consumers. This is means, it is for shoppers only not for spending leisure moments. it would lead to much more crowded inside a little space If people continue spent their off-work life in the plaza. For instance, most shopping places are only for buying brands with no more spots to play or sitting. Ċ in conclusion, the negative trend of spending leisure moments in shopping centres is due to the lack of connection between individuals and nature."
9909,"Should arts-related entertainment venues such as museums and art galleries be free of charge for the general public, or should a charge apply for admittance? Discuss this issue, and give your opinion","Art portrays the history of a country beautifully. In order to promote art among the population, some museums and galleries have no entrance fees. However, I am not in favour of a free admittance due to several reasons. The following paragraphs will highlight my opinion along with relevant examples. Ċ To commence, as we know, anything that comes for free does not have much value. The same goes for art-related venues, if they are free, people will simply not understand the importance of it. Subsequently, the primary idea of promoting arts may be lost. For example, Registan Square in Samarkand was free of charge for a month. As a result, many people were coming just to spend time with their friends. Later, the government had to introduce entrance fees again. Moreover, if art galleries become overcrowded, people who truly want to discover the paintings may constantly be distracted by those who come for entertainment. Ċ Adding further, entrance fees help art venues to cover running costs. More specifically, any museum has a number of maintenance expenses such as cleaning, air-conditioning, paying salaries, regularly painting and etc. The government will have to financially support the venue if it stops charging people for entrance. These funds could rather be spent on more vital sectors. For instance, on public health care and education. Ċ To conclude, I personally believe that museums should charge visitors. This may be beneficial for both, the venues as they can get money to maintain themselves, and individuals, they will value art more."
9910,"Because of the negative effects on health of an inactive lifestyle, all university students and school children should be forced to do sports activities at least 3 times per week. Ċ Do you agree or disagree?","People today, lead sedentary lives, due to their addiction to technology and long work hours, which has adverse health effects. This has lead to the thought that, students should be made to participate in outdoor activities at least thrice a week, by educational institutions. I am in the favour of this idea, as physical exercise is important for the physical as well as mental well being of the pupils. This essay will augment my opinion. Ċ Firstly, most of the children and collegians, engage themselves in passive activities such as watching Tv or playing video games during their spare time, which has lead to the rise of obesity and related disorders. Hence, mandatory participation in games and other exercises at schools and colleges, can provide their bodies, with appropriate fitness regime needed to maintain healthy body weight and a strong immune system. Additionally, numerous studies have shown that a person who trains thrice a week is less likely to develop any underlying conditions such as diabetes or blood pressure, and different sports provide various benefits to the human body. To cite an example, football increases blood circulation, while cricket and badminton reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. So, it can be said that forcing the young ones to partake in healthful activities, is indeed essential. Ċ Secondly, students today, are overly pressurised by the academic burden and therefore suffer from several mental illnesses like anxiety and depression. So, compelling them to perform athletic tasks, can give them a break from their studies and provide a way to channel the negative thoughts out. To illustrate this, a recent research has concluded that, engaging in outdoor games and events, can help their minds relax and rejuvenate, which in turn can improve their study performance, thus decreasing the probability of suffering from stress induced disorders. Ċ To conclude, wellness, sports and activities are prominent to maintain a good body. In my opinion, the sporting sessions should be mandated around the world, in order to keep tomorrow's adults fit and to assist them in picking up a healthy lifestyle."
9911,"In some countries, young people at the age of 18 are considered adults and can drive a car, vote and get married, while other countries don't allow it. What age do you think is the best to be considered an adult? Give reasons and examples.","In many countries the age at which young person is considered a legal adult is typically 18, but in some other countries young person's legal adulthood only starts when he or she turns 21. What defines a legal adult is the ability to legally work, participate in contracts, vote, marry, give sexual consent, and join the military. However, I personally think that the proper age of being an adult should be 21. In this essay, I am going to explain the reasons for this stand. Ċ First, although one might assume that most 18-year-olds have reached maturity, research has shown that adolescence actually extends into the early 20s. An 18-year-old's mindset has not fully matured. They are young adults on their way to explore the world, to experience and to learn new things. Thus, some of them try to act cool like women and men when they do not even know how to handle the responsibilities as adults. For example, they go clubbing and drinking, but never learn about the consequences. Accident statistics in many cities in Russia showed a substantial jump in the number of drunken driving accidents involving 18 to 20-year-olds. Ċ Second, in reality, most young adults are still in high school when they are 18 years old and they do not have a job. Therefore, they are not ready for all of the physical and mental challenges that go along with being adults such as raising a family or supporting themselves. For many parents, the term legal adult does not mean their children possess certain adult characteristics. For instance, being an adult implies being able to make mature decisions, participate in civic matters, have self-control, and be responsible. Some 18-year-olds simply lack these characteristics and need further time to develop them. It is quite clear that when children turn to 21 years old, they have already been in colleges and have had some life experiences, hence, they understand how to responsible for their actions. Ċ In conclusion, 18-year-olds are not matured enough to be considered adults. The best age should be 21 when one is better prepared to take on adult responsibilities."
9912,"Topic: In some countries it is thought advisable that children begin formal education at four years old, while in others they do not have to start school until they are seven or eight. How far do you agree with either or these view?","Parents always want the best things for their kids so they may hesitate whether they should send their kids to school soon or not. Some parents hold the opinion that children should be allowed stay at home from four to five years old. However, others believe that it is important for young children to go to school at the age of four. My arguments for this point are listed as follows. Ċ When children go to kindergarten they will achieve a new education without their family. Teachers will prepare them for not only knowledge but also essential skills in the school. According to the scientists, children are really go-ahead and like discovering at this age, so school is an immaculate environment for developing physical and mental of young children . Moreover, children also have exigency opening relationships then their communication abilities are advanced. Ċ Even if it is true that children should go to school soon, they can easy cope with some difficulties when they have to step in a strange environment. In fact, mothers always worry about how their children are taken care in school. Especial when a lot of kindergartens is not unhygienic. Moreover, this is good environment to spread diseases because all kids eat and sleep together. However, children who come to school soon, will have a good preparation when they are going to enter the first grade than children did not go to kindergarten before. Ċ To sum up, children will develop both physical and mental when they go to school soon. Furthermore, today, sending kids to school is a terrific solutions with mothers who cope with not only pressure working but also pressure family . Therefore, we should propagate this information to each mother understanding that every child should go to school at the appropriate age."
9913,"Due to the tight schedule humans have, more working families are in favor of fast food to be consumed by their children. What problem will be emerged because of this phenomenon and how to cope with that problem?","Nowdays, people's mobility are increasing rapidly. Because they have tight schedule every day, some working families decide fast food or instant food to fulfill their consumption. That food will be consumed by their children and might make problem such as obesity in early age. Their parents should maintain their children's food and weight, and become positive role model to support them for spending much time actively playing outside or do some physical activities together with them. Ċ Busy families who cook less and eat fast food out more can be contributed to make children having obesity. Undoubtedly, there is not much nourishment in fast food. The children who are obese because of it can cause another risk of serious health problems, such as diabetes, heart attack, and asthma in early age. Moreover, childhood obesity make emotional toll which lead them to have low self-esteem, negative body image, and depression. Therefore, it needs role of parent to control their children's food and weight to prevent that problem does not happen. Ċ The parent can avoid that problem with applying healthy food and lifestyle in daily activities. Because children have been mimicking their parent, it is the perfect way to become positive role model for their child. For instance, they start to cook more and make home-cooked with good nutrition and suitable food proportion while tell them the function of healthy food for their better development. In addition, they invite them to do some their family's enjoyable sport at outside while inform the beneficial some physical activities to keep themselves healthy. Ċ Preventing children have obesity in young age needs role of parent to cope that problem. Their parent should preserve good nutrition and healthy food for their children. To maintain their weight, parents should show the positive figure with introducing healthy lifestyle by still active and exercise or do some simple sport with their children."
9914,"We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in businesses, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?","In this computer-dominated world, just by a simple click, everything can be easily carried out. This idea, however, does not receive unanimous approval from global citizens. It is argued that computers will jeopardize the future of our modern world. This essay will focus on to what extent computers may affect our lives. Ċ First of all, the advantages that computers yield are blindingly obvious. Nowadays, with a well-programmed computer, we can get things done with pinpoint accuracy. With the omnipresence of this technological product, for the years to come, there will be probably no news about ""human errors"" that hit the deadlines. Furthermore, there will be a significant reduction in human employment. A lot of time and energy would be saved if computers went into global application. Employers would be the first to benefit as the desired results are still achieved with the cost on human labor kept to the minimum. Ċ On the other hand, there are still some imminent dangers. Too much dependence on computers envisages a vision in which the world will end up in catastrophe if one day, all the computers fail to fulfill human's demands. This discouraging prospect is quite likely especially now, when the Internet is so ""densely populated"". Research shows that by 2020, Internet will have been overloaded whereas its potential alternative still remains unknown. The expanding use of computers also accounts for the escalating rate of unemployment. The approaching consequence is predictable: the society will be suffocated by social crimes once redundant people grow more and more reckless. Ċ To conclude, I contend that the issue of wide use of computers should receive a more considerate approach as the advantages that it brings about are far from laughable."
9915,Art and music are considered some of the fundamental elements of all societies. Do you think art and music still have a place in today's modern world of technology? Ċ Should children spend more time learning art and music at school?,"With the advancement of technologies, children tend to spend more time with devices. Some people think children should do more learnings in arts and music subjects at school. I strongly believe this is a good idea and will elucidate the reasons why they should be encouraged to follow it. Ċ First of all, music plays an indispensable role in improving the mental conditions of people. Due to the present education system, it is incontrovertible that children spend more time on studies compared to the past, so that this has caused mental related problems for some teens. It has proven that music helps them to concentrate on their studies and reduce stress so that it alleviates these mental health problems. For instance, when a child studies consecutively for few hours at school, he.she may lose concentration, However; studies on Change prepositionapplyIt seems that preposition use may be incorrect here. Ċ show examplesmusic would help him/her mind to be calm and bring back the focus. Because of these reasons, I believe music is important for kids' development. Ċ Furthermore, sculptures and drawings have valuable educational benefits for students. For example, though the famous Mona-lisa masterpiece was painted in hundred years ago, still researchers are conducting their researches to study it. It proves that these arts have hidden lessons that are important for children to study and do further researches. This learning gives them the ability to improve their imagination which leads to an increase in their thinking capacity. Ċ In summary, arts and music has played an important role in the past generation as well and present generation. I strongly agree that schools should facilitate children to spend more time studying these subjects as it has proven benefits for them."
9916,"That many students are far too dependent on computers for their study may have some negative effects. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement. In about 180-220 words, write an essay to support your opinion. overdependence on computers","It is observed that the abuse of computers for academic work may have some detrimental impacts on learners. In my opinion, I agree with this viewpoint to a large extent for two following reasons. Ċ The first reason is that, without strict parental supervision, regular exposure to computer screens can cause tremendous harm to students' health. For example, students who are spending an excessive amount of time searching information on the Internet, are likely to suffer from short eye-sight and obesity due to a sendentary lifestyle. Therefore, physical development of the these students is negatively affected in terms of health. Ċ The second reason to support this idea is that using computers unreasonably sometimes leads to plagiarism and lack of creativity among students. In fact, most students of all ages have admitted copying essays or lectures from various online websites, which makes them less enthusiastic in finishing homework on their own and in coming up with new ideas and solutions in real life. In this sense, computers are believed to worsen learners' cognitive development. Ċ In conclusion, it seems to me that, the overdependence on computers for studies presents some disadvantages based on these above explanations. It is therefore advisable that students be alert to potential dangers of computers abuse."
9917,Not enough students around the world choose to study science subjects at university. What are the reasons for this? What impact does this issue have on society?,"Education plays a vital role in humans life. Because it is needed to be educated in the competitive globe to get respect from the society. However, nowadays, people are not opting for science-related subjects to study. This essay will examine the reasons and impacts of the above-mentioned issues in detail in the following paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, the present-day generation is too optimistic towards arts and business-related subjects. This is because of high paid and reputed job opportunities. Besides this, the professions like lectures, engineers, accountants and lawyers and all receive good esteem from the community. In addition, the noticeable one is, in a particular culture in India girls are not allowed to study a science degree due to some moral values. To summarize, job opportunities, good pay and consideration are the main reasons for choosing other subjects rather than science. Ċ On the contrary, the above-mentioned problem has the worst demerits. Like, shortage of nurses, doctors and even IT professionals worldwide. For example, during this pandemic situation, all the countries are in demand of staff to work in the hospitals.To exemplify, a recent study report from World Health Organization proved that, one nurse is caring for two to four patients in the Intensive Care Unit due to staff shortfall which is actually unethical. As a result of this, patients may fail to receive quality care. To summarize, the impact of the above-mentioned matter is the deficit number of health care providers globally. Ċ Finally, students should give equal importance to all subjects to study. Because the world needs all professionals."
9918,"Nowadays, as a part of the educational process, students work at a company for a short period of time without pay. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","In recent times, universities are committing many unpaid internships as a need to accomplish students' success. In my opinion, although this impose may have some disadvantages, it has much more advantages. Ċ Primary, many undergraduates consider working at a company without any income as a waste of time. In fact, those kinds of duties are performed in the summertime, where youth have been prohibited from their vacation. They are obliged by not less than eight hours a day. Moreover, it is costly. In a way , students have to overcome the financial extra charges, as well as companies, are not paying any money for them. For example, an individual has to cover transportation fees in order to reach his/her workplace every day. Ċ On the other hand, I believe that many advantages gained by the scholar from training. Indeed, everyone has a significant opportunity to acquire work experience and practice his/her educational knowledge. For instance, many senior engineers search for offices that offer training on sites. Furthermore, it is a chance to communicate with employees and take a general idea about the working place and atmosphere. Youth will become used to arriving at the moment and respecting people. In addition, these internships teach undergraduates how to take responsibility and manage their time. They will be given real tasks to finish in a specific period and in the correct way. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that training is a good opportunity that has many advantages in comparison with the few disadvantages. It is a new teaching method that I strongly recommend being followed by all countries."
9919,"People should choose their course of study not on the basis of their own interests, but based on the kinds of jobs they can get. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Education plays an immense role in the holistic development of the students. People have differing opinion regarding the choice of course to study. Many people argue that students should not opt any subject based on their interest, rather they the choice should depend on the availability of jobs in the country. I strongly disagree with the argument and believe that people should give the priority to the field in which they are interested. Ċ First and foremost reason for opposing the statement is the satisfaction. People should be satisfied with the subjects they are studying to obtain the outstanding results and it will definitely widen their horizon. When a student or professional educating a course based on interest, it will encourage them to work hard to understand the deeper context and this will eventually help them to get more opportunities for jobs. For instance, a recent survey of the Mother Teresa University has revealed that the students are more likely to get jobs easily in their interested area as compared to those who study a course, only to find a job. Ċ In addition to it, there are some issues related to get an education in the subject only for seeking jobs. For example, recent studies show that people who studying only to get jobs without any interest in academics are more stressful and unable to perform well in the respective field, because they find this area monotonous and failed to concentrate. On the other hand, another group of individuals who study, according to their curiosity, regardless to find a job, are more comfortable and show fruitful results. Thus, people should get education according to their attentiveness instead of availability of jobs. Ċ To conclude, needless to say, results of educating a subject depend on the curiosity could be more fruitful and excellent because people will enjoy studying it, without any burden of getting jobs in the future. Hence, this is a better approach to be successful in life."
9920,Many people these days choose to work abroad after graduation. Do the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages.,"It is going without saying that being employed abroad following finishing post-secondary schools is skyrocketing that brings pitfalls as well as benefits. Notwithstanding, this discourse delves into both outlooks, and subsequently will put forward my own perspective, accordingly. Ċ Apparently, exponents that contain argue that having a career in a foreign nation can have boons rather than negative impacts-have their justification. The rationale behind their argument is more likely due to the fact that when younglings pursuit their future in a different country, not only they can develop the sense of global citizen by understanding the cultures, and customs of the host country but also express their own ethics, and lifestyle to the surrounding. Consequently, the concept of a multi-cultural provincial can arise and the whole world can be a global village. According to one survey by Chronicle-Journal, in 2011, for exemplification, 57% of Canada's working population is from the globe wide that have contributed to stand as a developed nation. Moreover, one can earn a handsome amount of remuneration which may not possible for many underdeveloped countries' human race. Ċ Conversely, are there any unfavourable sides to working overseas? Certainly, yes, when a provincial's own manpower is being attracted to western work styles and benefits, it will lose its own tradition and local ethnicity. It follows that nothing is easy when an individual sets to the whole new cultural pattern, he/she definitely will absorb in learning things and as time goes nobody knows as to whether he will come back to his/her own country or not. Put differently, people struggle hard to set in host nation by sacrificing their home-sickness, family isolation, food trouble, and being part of racism. Thus, vindication for disadvantages of being hired overseas. Ċ To conclude, having explored both viewpoints, personally, I consent to the hilt that there are numerous negative sides of working for foreign countries; however, the beneficial points supersede the other side as one can be rich in terms of honorarium and mingling with other cultures."
9921,"“Prison is the only truly effective form of punishment, because it separates criminals from society.” To what extent do you support this view? You should give reasons for your answer, and include ideas and examples from your own knowledge and experience.","In the beginning, there is no doubt that we should find an effective way to contain and prevent high crime levels in order to protect citizens. In many cases, imprisonment can be seen as the right decision, however, I personally believe that it cannot be an option for many minor crimes, such as shoplifting, burglary, and blackmail. Ċ First and foremost, it is clear that many people are keen to detain the criminals outside of the public. In this regard, some citizens have been willing to enforce the law. From the many peoples’ view point, violent punishments, such as capital punishment and life sentence are the factors which deter criminals. However, if the government and other members of society do not take measures to rehabilitate offenders, they will break the law continuously. For example, in the Western countries, special psychologists work with perpetrators to prevent their antisocial behaviour in the future. Ċ The another my argument is that other people have not a right to separate other members and punish strictly. Some people believe that these kind of actions cannot be taken in these days. Furthermore, dividing lawbreakers from the public is not an effective method to deter a crime. In addition to this, some petty crimes should use other methods, such as fines and house arrest. To illustrate, many developed countries preclude minor crimes with financial penalties, which is much more productive than jail. However, Some violent criminals should be kept out of public life, because of a dangerous threat to society. Ċ In conclusion, although some individuals believe that confinement is a good way to deter a crime, personally, I reckon to think that these techniques are very old and ineffective. In my opinion, we should use modern methods."
9922,"The tuition fees issue University education should be free to everyone,  regardless of income. To what extent do you agree? 300-350 words.","There is currently a contentious argument over whether a zero cost of university tuition fees should be given to every students notwithstanding their income. From my point of view, I am not in favor of this opinion due to the two main reasons. Ċ To begin with, I believe that students are responsible of paying for their own acquisition of knowledge, especially for the precious lessons which they receive at universities. Consequently,they are also likely to be more appreciative and try to develop a methodical study approach. It is a common sense that every movements in life bring experience and have its value. In order to achieve it, a determined money and time investment is compelled. The aforementioned idea can be applied in this case.If undergraduates desire knowledge or experience, they have to pay a price. Ċ Another reason why I do not approve of the notion is that it may cause a deficit in the institutions' budget. Given that the school do not earn any profit from the tuition fees, the school board of managers can have a difficulty remunerating the teaching staff as well as the service workers, not to mention electricity and other facilities. In addition, some of the teachers might resign because of the low-paid salary. This eventually leads to the degradation of the university 's reputation and quality. Ċ In conclusion, I do not agree with the opinion that education at university should be free no matter how much they could afford. This can be put down to two rationales: the responsibility of students to pay for their pursuits and the lack of money in institutions. In this case, I highly recommend applying for a scholarship to lower the cost or searching for a part-time job to earn more money."
9923,Having good academic qualification and diploma guarantees people a good job . to what extent do you Agree or disagree?,"Education has always been a vital part of human development. Methods of delivering knowledge have been different in every era nevertheless, the motive of educating people is mutual. Nowadays, a person's abilities have been directly linked to the degree he/she holds. I will discuss both the positive and negative aspect of this approach. Ċ In days gone by, with the surge in technology and the advancement in science, education has become the basic necessity to get along with the modern earth. With the widespread telecommunication, ways of learning have been improvised in multiple ways and access to literacy becoming easier. For example, if someone wants to become an engineer, for that there are specific paths and levels that have been instructed and provided in the higher institutes. Where they train student theoretically and practically to perform their job at the best. After passing the exam the gradation has been issued to the individual that is the entrance card for the fellow, to enter into the professional world and pursue his/her career. Ċ On the other hand, there is a down-side of this approach, there are many individuals who do not have access to the advance studies, as well as, are not able to afford expensive education programs and yet, they carry skills in the field of their interest. For them, the degree is the barrier in order to utilize their talent for the professional zone. For instance, recently Google has announced that have started hiring people based on their prowess, instead of their qualification, which is an amazing initiative that opened the door for the creative minds to the professional world. Ċ To sum up, I would strongly agree to the point that people cannot be totally judged solely on the basis of the piece of paper they hold. Holding the vision and the talent that requires to excel in any field is far important than holding degree only."
9924,"Task 2: Nowadays, it seems that people tend to waste a great amount of food. Why do you think this is happening? And how can we solve this problem?","In recent years, the prevalence of food wasted has been an increasing concern due to its substantial impact on human life as well as the environment. To put a halt to this situation, this essay will initially attempt to pinpoint the causes for food waste and subsequently offer some actionable solutions. Ċ There are two underlying explanations for the tendency towards wasting food nowadays. One of the reasons is that food is more straightforward to afford. Since the average income as well as food productivity increases, affording food daily no longer imposes a burden on most families. The second reason for food squandering can be attributable to the mass fear of food-poisoning. In fact, a myriad of families tend to dispose food before the expiry date while it is completely edible. Ċ Nevertheless, there are also a number of solutions to alleviate this issue. Firstly, people could voluntarily aid in food-rescue organizations. These organizations are set up to reduce the food wastage resulting from pre-expiry date disposal in big supermarkets by collecting them and giving out to the underprivileged. Secondly, the government could publish policies to ensure the quality of food on the market. By this way, faulty food would no longer be a concern for people. Ċ In conclusion, affordability and mass misconception about food poisoning are two main factors attributed to large amount of food squandered. To mitigate these, it is recommended that food-rescue organizations be assisted . Furthermore, governors could ensure food safety by publishing reasonable policies."
9925,Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.,"Nowadays, more and more undergraduates are attracted by the idea of studying abroad. In my opinion, I firmly believe that this choice is motivated by numerous advantages, such as the opportunity of attending the best schools all around the world. This essay will showcase most of the reasons for this decision. Ċ First and foremost, undoubtedly parents are always seeking the best for their pupils, then they always want them to attend the most prestigious universities. For instance, thousands of Moroccans studied in the UK for the last decade, the majority of them are now brilliant in their professional careers.This is due to the renowned educative system this country has. Furthermore, many countries offer scholarships for hundreds of students, this is certainly another reason why they choose to study abroad. Ċ However, there is a myriad of other reasons for this decision. For example, attending a school in a foreign country means learning a new language which is certainly a positive aspect, since it will enhance their communication skills and assets. In addition, students are attracted by the idea of learning abroad in order to live alone, this is a new challenge for them, thus it will inevitably make them more responsible. Moreover, living in a different country is seen as an exciting experience by teenagers, because they will discover a new culture.`However, parents should be aware of the multiple dangers of this choice. Ċ To sum up, studying abroad offers many opportunities for learners, such as attending prestigious universities or simply discovering new regions of the world. Finally, the question is will post-graduate go back to their native land after finishing their studies or not."
9926,"People nowadays are more easily influenced by fashion, especially on their clothes and hairstyle. What factors lead to the phenomenon? Is it a positive or negative trend?","Currently, people are paying a lot of attention on fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair. In fact, there are many factors lead to this phenomenon. Ċ Firstly, media plays a key role in influencing people's opinions. More and more media attention is paid to clothing, foot wear and accessories. People are living in the world wherever media takes as the main interface to exchange information. Television, magazines and outdoor advertisings are fulfilled with a variety of fashion which includes new clothing collection on Milan fashion weeks, iPad2 published in New York, or LV bags shown in Paris. People are more easily attracted by these fashion goods and influenced by the fashion trend. Ċ Another important factor is more likely the modern lifestyles of human beings. In the past, most clothing was custom made. It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers; however, modern technologies make it possible to be mass-produced in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices. In that case, people have more chances to choose clothing designed by other countries in different style. Ċ Overall, I think that people following fashion is a good trend. It shows their thinking is modern and flexible. They are willing to accept and process new ideas which help to expand their outlook. Furthermore, fashion maybe a good way to help people alleviate pressures of their daily life. Wearing new clothes would show your confidence and make you happy for a whole day."
9927,"People spend large amounts of time and money on clothes, hairstyles and make up to change their appearance. Is it important for people to be concerned about the way they look? What are the consequences of focussing on physical appearance?","Personal appearance is a crucial part of everybody's life. Some people try to change it in different ways, such as buying clothes, hairstyles and makeup. Then, they need to use their time and money to do it. This essay will present some ideas about the importance of this concern and some consequences of staying focused on how people's look. Ċ On the one hand, most of the daily activities need a certain type of clothing. Some may believe that attending to this is important to receive others' respect. Therefore, focusing on self-image is a natural response to it. For example, employees at the university level or in front of a desk wear formal. For that reason, they spend a high part of their payment to improve their dresses, suits and, shoes. Women usually buy makeup to feel comfortable while working. Also, although bank workers wear uniforms they are worried about their interaction with customers. So, they invest in new hairstyles or nail polish. Yet, a few people change how they look in order to be unique among a group of people or a classroom, not for professional reasons. Ċ On the other hand, spending too much time thinking about the physical aspect could result in a loss of focus in other important areas. Hairstyling or make-up needs to stay updated continuously to keep looking as expected. It is an expensive activity to sustain. Economic problems could be the consequence of a superficial lifestyle. Moreover, those activities need several minutes or even hours to be completed. Worrying about that remove time and money from other personal tasks such as making exercise or cooking healthy food. In some cases, putting all the attention on the image is a distraction from other important aspects as intelligence, effort and, responsibility. Ċ To conclude, it is crucial to be worried about personal appearance, however, the balance must be part of it. The positive consequences could increase the quality of service and the lifestyle, while the over-attention to this topic could bring financial or even health issues."
9928,"Topic:  Beside the internet's advantages, some people think that the internet brings bad effects. To what extent, do you agree or disagree? essay about effect of internet on our life","The role of the internet is today debated, with some claiming that it is really harmless beside its advantages. So I do entirely accept this, and I will explain why in this essay. Ċ Firstly, I must consider the potential disadvantage of the internet's lure in modern society. For example, the relationship among most of the people in a society has become much more distant than in the past because a digital device with internet seem to be concerned as the best friend taken with them all the time. We can see this in a family whose members are no longer willing to compliment each other or in a group whose people are too busy using internet instead talking with each other. Furthermore, there are numerous examples of tension between digital devices and the internet, ranging from computer to laptop, ipad and smartphone. In these cases, the internet definitely leads to an emotionless world. Ċ Another reason to be wary of this idea is the information. It is sometimes said that the internet is a source bringing people the large number of information in a huge range of fields. In reality, however, it is definitely not to be a reliable source because there are various drugging and corruption or unreal information from images to news or music is likely to damage a whole generation of the young. This causes social issues such as violence, evil, ,mental disorder increasingly common. We leave with the impression that internet appears to be a cunning demon eating human's heart as well as mind. Ċ It is not to say that the internet is entirely bad, of course. There are some benefits in terms of fostering acquisition of knowledge. But to say that its force in society development is to ignore various problems it causes."
9929,"Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.","Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication. Ċ Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses. Ċ On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals. Ċ From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime."
9930,"Some people believe famous people's support towards international aid organisations draws the attention to problems, while others think celebrities make the problems less important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There is a dispute over the impact of celebrities on global aid organisations, whether it helps emphasise the issues or not. In my perspective, I concur with the opinion that those influencers can advocate those organisations with public attention and financial aids. Ċ On the one hand, there are several reasons to approve of the support from celebrities towards non-profit organisations. Firstly, famous people have already had their own fandoms, thus, influencing their habits and behaviours. Any campaign endorsed by a celebrity is deemed to obtain more promotion from their supporters. Secondly, receiving attention from the media, public figures can reach out to non-fans and convey the campaigns' messages. Therefore, those projects can get funding from not only their fans but also various companies and institutions. Lastly, famous people can donate themselves, such as Elton John, who has his Elton John Aids Foundation advocating for HIV/AIDS prevention, education, and treatment. Ċ On the other hand, many argue that the endorsement of public figures can make the problems insignificant. As the media only focus on their involvement, the ultimate purpose of the campaign or the real causes of the issue can be shadowed. Since the representative of several famous ones and public attention only last for a limited period, the sustainable impact of the campaign is questionable. Moreover, their images need to be in accord with organisations' visions and missions. If they have any scandal, the campaign can acquire adverse effects. For instance, the Sussex Royal has received much opposition on the advocation of climate change after their separation. Ċ In conclusion, whilst public figures' support, without cautions, can negatively affect the issues, their attributions are critical for international aid organisations to receive promotion and fundings."
9931,Television dominates the free-time of too many people. It can make people lazy and prevent them from socialising with others. Ċ Do you agree or disagree?,"Watching TV is one of the most common favourite pass-time for many individuals. I agree that this entertainment is believed to be a prime reason that people these days have become lethargic and prefer being unsocial. In this essay, we will discuss a few points that will support my views. Ċ To begin with, television is considered to be an addictive entertainment platform, where people can spend hours watching movies and series. In addition, since the billing on the cable connection of the television is done on a monthly basis, individuals can watch unlimited shows on them. Consequently, leading the individual to spend more time looking on the tv screen than meeting their friends and family. To illustrate, during weekends, I usually like watching Netflix on my LCD screen and because of which, I rarely get time to meet my friends. Ċ Moreover, it is also believed that since one often watches tv on a couch in the living room or on the bed, people tend to become more comfortable during that time, subsequently, relaxing their mind and body. As a result, they become lazy and might not wish to do any other chores. For instance, during my business trips, I used to spend my entire day on the bed, watching movies back to back. Further, my mind and body become so lethargic that I order the food online. Ċ To conclude, I concur that although being an evergreen medium of entertainment, watching television can make a person lazy and may like to live in isolation."
9932,"The media, especially the television is failing to represent the world in its true light. As a consequence, the younger generation is growing up in a fantasy world with a false conception of their surroundings. Ċ Present your argumentation to highlight your opinion on this matter. Give reasons and specific examples to support your opinions.","It is advocated that the mass media, namely television, has failed in its attempt to reflect the world for what it truly is. Therefore, our successor is maturing in a fictional world with an inaccurate perception of their surroundings. From my perspective, I voice disapproval of the aforementioned, in that I believe it is rather one-sided by putting the label on all individuals, which is in fact not the case. Ċ In the first place, in a world where social media is predominant, strict laws and regulations on authorized content are, obviously, imposed in the interests of the public's mentality and orientation. In other words, official news sources and TV stations are under the influence of censorship, thus compromising the reliability and accuracy of the information published. For instance, such broadcasting houses of great integrity as CNN or BBC News are known as being trustworthy due to their independence from external political and commercial forces. Ċ What is more, it is undeniable that humans in the modern generation have evolved to be more knowledgeable and self-conscious; hence, they are mature enough to form a clear conception of their surroundings without any domineering factors. In particular, should any widespread information be fallacious, most people would not hesitate to take a stand against it, as long as it has been brought home to them. For example, as a feature on many channels or even YouTube, users could report any programmes containing misleading or obscene content in order to eradicate misinformation. Ċ Nevertheless, there exist several exceptions when news is controlled for specific purposes. As an illustration, so as not to arouse the public's bafflement and worries, very sensitive political matters are kept secret without anyone's acknowledgement. Furthermore, a few publishers are also pro-government, whose series and broadcasts steer towards the only bright side of the authorities. Ċ All things considered, while there appear to be some problems with social media as regards politics and military issues, most publishing houses fulfil their duty in providing viewers with accurate and detailed information on current affairs. Consequently, I do not support the above-mentioned view which claims that media has not succeeded in reflecting reality."
9933,"Technology have developed very fast in the past 100 years. However, some people think that technology progress has brought negative effect on humanity. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?","Many believe that scientific advancements brought many negative impacts on the human race. I agree with this notion. This essay will explain this phenomenon in detail with suitable examples and conclude with my own opinion. Ċ We have witnessed a widespread growth in technology over the past 100 years. From office duty to daily household chores, machines have become an integral part of our daily life. It all started with the discovery of the steam engine which was the revolutionary step of mankind in the area of transportation. It opened the door of globalization which further takeover by the discovery of electricity and telecommunication. Electricity laid the foundation stone of the modern world in which every task can be performed with the little or complete assistance of the machines. For instance, as per the survey conducted by Tesla motors, over the past 50 years, automation has taken over 20% of human jobs and it will increase drastically in the next few decades. Ċ As matter of fact, every boon comes with a bane; therefore, technology also drew many negative impacts on humanity. Firstly and topmost, today we are fighting for our existence with the most deadly enemy which is pollution caused by the engines which we have developed. Additionally, this automation has made humans lazy or less physically active. Due to this, the physical strength of the humans is on the constant decline which invites many deadly diseases. Moreover, the discovery of lethal devices, such as nuclear bombs, could jeopardize our life. For example, in 1945, the USA detonated two cities of japan named Hiroshima and Nagasaki using nuclear bombs and it not only immediately killed several thousand people but also many still suffering due to the radiation impact. Thus, I agree that technology has brought many negative impacts on humans. Ċ To conclude, although I agree that science has made our life very easy but we can't deny its negative impact on our ecosystem."
9934,Some people believe that a county becomes more interesting and develops faster when its population includes a mixture of different nationalities and cultures. Ċ Do you agree or disagree ?,"In the present age, there has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether multicultural countries are more interesting and have the opportunity to develop faster. Personally, I totally agree with this statement and I feel this way because of some reasons that will be explained in the following essay. Ċ The primary reason we have to take into consideration is that the countries with various cultures have different traditions that make them really interesting both for themselves and the population from other parts of the world. For instance, Iran is a multicultural land which is located in the middle east and contains nations from different nationalities and races such as Kurdish, Turkish, Arab, and Persian persons. Due to that fact, each part of the country has a unique tradition, food, custom, and language and making it a good destination for tourists. Ċ The next reason that is worth point out is that societies with different nationalities have different backgrounds and experiences. Furthermore, if they work as a unique team, they will be able to develop their country faster than other spots of the earth. For example, Japanese is famous for their hard-working habit, and Indians are well-known for their problem-solving ability, assume that these people work in the same country. Absolutely, this team will be able to manage issues perfectly and has an amazing outcome. Ċ To sum up, I would like to conclude that there are many advantages for the countries that are multinational. This feature gives them opportunities to developing quickly and also being a tourist attraction place."
9935,"Many parents complain about violence promoted to their children through video games, TV programs and other media. Why is it happening? What can be the solution for it?","These days, many parents are concerned about their children’s violent behaviour because of the increase in the portrayal of violence in various entertainment programs. These programs have many harmful effects. However, It is very crucial to find out considerable reasons and to look for solutions to tackle the problem. Ċ First of all, violence has impacts on children because they spend more time on playing video games, as youngsters do not have more outside activities to do. Although, They do not find highly educational programmes which are so fascinating to enjoy. Therefore, they consider violent games as the best way to entertain during leisure time. Gradually, violent games become the indispensable part of children's life. To solve the problem, a realistic scenario can be applied that the government should build centres for children to spend their time on playing and studying together. For instance, in Vietnam, every district in Ho Chi Minh City has a public place where children can study dance, music, art and so on every day. Ċ Second of all, TV shows often contain violence to attract viewers. If there were not violent scene, TV shows could be too depressing. As a result, broadcasts would face with bankruptcy. In contrast, the fact has negative effects on behaviour of children. In other words, viewers may be stimulated their brain by violent shows which encourage viewers to do the same things in the real life. To tackle the problem, the education from parents plays an important role. Parents should spend more time with their children to educate their children about backwards of violent shows. For example, parents and children can watch scientific programs together to encourage children to discover the world. Ċ To conclude, children are impacted by violence from console games, TV shows since they spend more time on things containing lots of violence. To solve the problem, the role of the government and parents is so important."
9936,"Over the last few decades, there has been an increase in international tourism. Some people think that tourism is beneficial for local communities and should be encouraged. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree","International travel becomes easy for everyone and travellers visit to another country for spending their holidays. It is often believed by some people that international travellers bring many positives for local people. I agree with this given statement as this brings jobs and opportunity to learn from foreigners. Ċ There are many arguments which favour the benefits of international tourism. It generates employment for local people. Needless to say when a foreigner comes to a country. Firstly, it brings employment for local people. People come and stay nearby hotels and spend money on other necessary things such as food, travel. Thus, all the people who are associated with this business get money and jobs from this. For example, Indonesia is one of the most famous tourist destination for foreigners and tourism play an important role in their economy. Ċ Secondly, tourism exchange cultures among people. Tourists not only bring their culture; but also learn the local culture of the hosting nation. They learn good things about local customs and spread these to the world, which helps local people and country and it creates a positive image in the world's eyes. To illustrate, India is very famous for their culture and politeness and when foreigners visit India they get a chance to learn this custom. The Hare Krishna moment is a real example of this. Ċ To conclude, Tourism industry has grown in the last few years and it brings many advantages for local hosting peoples such as employment and cultural exchange. I believe this has a positive impact."
9937,Nowadays for many people the Internet is replacing regular books. What do you think will Ċ happen in the future and what is your opinion?,"According to some people, the internet and connected devices are taking place of traditional books. This essay will discuss what could be expected for the future and also provide arguments to support why I believe this is a positive change. Ċ To begin with, it is obvious that regular books are being replaced by digital devices. This trend is more likely to increase in the future. This is because many people believe those electronic devices are more appropriate for students since there is no need to carry lots of books anymore. For example, universities are not asking any more for students to buy physical books. Instead, they require that graduates have laptops and access to the internet. Indeed, in a near future, I believe that regular books will disappear and this trend has already begun. Ċ Although some people think this is a negative development, I believe this is a huge improvement. Those electronic devices are completely user-friendly and graduates or readers can carry different books in just one device. To illustrate, e-readers allow users to keep more than one hundred books in the internal storage. This is a development unimaginable in the past. In addition, e-readers and laptops make the price of books drop because there is no necessity to spend a lot of money during the printing process and, as a result, more people have access to information. Ċ To sum up, digital devices are the new positive trend and it will make physical books disappear. I suggest that governments cut taxes from those devices to allow more people to buy it."
9938,"So,Almost everybody nowadays is found using personal vehicle for travelling purpose. What are the reasons of this increasing trend? Explain what negative outcomes may be faced in the society due to this.","The demands for private means of transportation for travelling is rapidly growing among modern people. Initially, this essay will suggest that the biggest causes of the phenomenon are poor public transportation and comfort zone of living standard and then argue that changes in the environment and financial burden are the most detrimental ramifications. Ċ To begin with, the foremost reason the travel by personal vehicles is that generally public transportations are considered as an over-crowded, non-availability of flexible hours, heavy fare and so forth. As a result, people prefer the safest, easiest and affordable way of travelling through their own source of transportation. For instance, a survey conducted recently by BBC News has revealed that 55% of the world population are using their automobiles to commute and other purposes. Moreover, governments and private financial institutes are offering numerous vehicle loan options to society. Consequently, most individuals buy their desired vehicles with the provided loan. Therefore, various reasons enhance the community to use personal means of transportation. Ċ As a consequence, it can never be denied that this tendency could have some negative effects on society. Firstly, the pollution level is rising due to exhaust foam and noise which are generated by cars or motorbikes. Thus, global warming is becoming a serious concept in today's epoch. Secondly, the car loan facility with low-interestCorrect your spellinglow interestThe word low-interest doesn’t seem to fit this context. Consider replacing it with a different one. Ċ show examples rate attract consumers in the beginning but later they realize financial helpless owing to pay monthly instalments to bank from a limited budget. Accordingly, they may fail to secure themselves and their family's future in an appropriate manner. For example, most middle-class employees are committed suicide in the last year because they could not afford the loan pressure. Hence, having own vehicles become a serious problem for society. Ċ To conclude, less developed public transportation and financial supports are enhancing folk to use private means of transportation for travelling. However, steps should be taken to change this trend as the drawbacks of this are clear, with potentially dangerous outcomes for society and individual as a whole."
9939,"In many countries, international tourism has become an important source of income. However, it also has negative effects. Do the benefits of international tourism outweigh the disadvantages?","Modern life suggests a great number of opportunities to be a tourist in foreign countries. There are several reasons for that. One of the most significant is that some cities attract with hospitality and service. Personally, I think that multicultural tourism has more advantages than disadvantages. Now, I will explain my point of view. Ċ Firstly, for some countries where lack fossil fuels or technological equipment it is a good chance to enhance the economical condition as a whole. For example, Turkey doesn`t have a huge financial circle in fuels because of its geographical position even if it is situated between two worlds. Nonetheless, Turkey would be empty unless surrounded by the black sea. Furthermore, Turkish society has done the condition like all-inclusive for tourists. That catch the mind of every person. In this ,case one of the disadvantages could be that it is a four-season attitude. Moreover,the workers do not have stable salaries the entire year. Ċ Secondly, tourism attracts communities from all over the earth. It means that a local nation can introduce culture, music, art and history of own bucolic. A brief example might stand that foreigners who spent vacation in another place can transmit received knowledge to their own population. After that for the next year number of visitors can increase twice, approximately. Also, If the city provided an excellent service then the world celebrities might attend them. For instance, well- known ""Nuseret"" meat cafe has already been attended by JLo and some more famous people. Taking everything into consideration, tourism is a potential aspect that should be improved in each homey. Ċ To conclude, looking from the inner side might cause misunderstanding from the side of native inhabitants due to the fact that multi-nationality is not preferable or not a good condition for locals but eye-opening service is given for tourists. The government should take into account developing and wide-spreading questions of the rustic otherwise it has a chance to leave at the list of third-world provinces."
9940,Topic: Ċ Some people think that the best way to improve road safety is reducing the amount of maximum speed of vehicles. Others think that other ways exist. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It has been argued by many that the best way to avoid accidents is to reduce the maximum speed limit of the cars, whereas others are of the opinion that the awareness campaigns and implementation of safety precautions can do the same. I think that both views are correct, as avoidance of accidents is very important to save precious lives. Ċ On the one hand, over speeding is one of the leading causes of road traffic accidents. Although speed thrills, but it kills, so it has to be kept under check. Secondly, the speedy vehicles can get out of control, thereby leading to a disaster. Moreover, if any untoward event, such as a tyre burst, occurs with a fast car it can lead to a fatal incident. For instance, according to an American research of 2019, about 75% of the highway collisions are due to over speeding. Therefore, I support the idea of reducing the maximum speed in order to make the travelling safe. Ċ On the other hand, strict adherence to the rules and improvement in the educational status of the individuals can also help to counter the issue. It's the duty of the police to impose heavy fines on the defaulters. Similarly, the issuance of a driving permit must be through a strict system. Furthermore, regular lectures and seminars have to be arranged for the general public to create a sense of responsibility in them. For example, the UK government takes the license back from an individual who gets three tickets in one year. So, I believe that a collective effort of national highway authority, motorway police, and the nation can help in decreasing the happenings. Ċ To conclude, there are a number of factors responsible for accidental deaths on the motorways, so they have to be addressed and rectified."
9941,"TOPIC: Email and text messaging have transformed communication, but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do u agree or disagree with this statement?","It is true that our way of life has been alternated as the new technologies are keeping to introduce to us. Email and text messaging, for instance, have been widespread, as a result, the traditional written language is declined seriously. I will demonstrate my opinion as following reasons: Ċ Firstly, the convenience of Email and text messaging bring to people is enormous, the service of written language is able to provide to us is too poor in comparison. the design of those technologies is to simplify the process of communication between people. it has the function of sending message in group of people. with this function, you can deliver many copies of message to large amount of people just with a simple click which is hardly imaged to spend monthly time to write novel by using written language. Considered on this point, the trend of written language being replaced by email and text messaging is undoubted. Ċ Secondly, the writing form of email and text messaging lets written language suffer. it is possibly because the majority of users of email and text messaging is from the young generation. those prefer to use slang and abbreviation to contact with small group of people. if a outsider try to come along, it is difficult for them to make assumption of the meanings of those words. from time to time. the formal way of written language could be highly possible to be reformed. the younger generation might learn totally different academic writing skill. Ċ In summary, as email and test messaging spread their powerful influence, it is unavoidable that the position of written language is in danger. Even though i personally support the conventional written language, the proper solution left to us is to educate young people the form of written language, to tell them the benefit of it to bring and encourage them to use it as much as possible."
9942,the popularity of science at schools Not enough students choose science subjects in universities in many countries. What are the reasons and what are the effects on society?,"In many nations, few students select subjects of science as their major in college. The main reasons are likely to be lack of interest or stereotype of a narrow career path, causing the companies hard to find employees with science-related skills. Ċ Since science subject requires heavy calculations, the lack of related training before college make students often fail on such science-related subjects as math and physics, discouraging their confidence in such subjects. Therefore, a lack of confidence is easy to lead to lack of interest, causing them to choose other subjects that include fewer calculations. Also, the career path of science is often connected to research jobs, which spent a lot of time working and was paid less. Unlike other industries like businesses, science will not be the first choice for high school graduates. Ċ However, many companies require people with strong analytical skills to conduct quantitative projects like how many new facilities need to be built or the forecast for next year earnings. Lacking this kind of professions make the enterprises hard to come up with plans, causing them the risk of failure. According to recent studies, it is told that quantitative analysis can help companies to have a more accurate forecast of the future, leading 50% less risk of going bankrupt. Ċ In conclusion, I think that schools should increase more practice of calculations and correct the misunderstanding of the science career path so that companies may have a brighter future."
9943,"Levels of youth crime are increasing rapidly in most cities around the world. Ċ What are the reasons for this, and suggest some solutions.","Levels of delinquency are soaring at high rates in many cities around the globe. It is because younger generations are more easily influenced and tend to copy almost everything they see on the television or in the media. Stricter policy about content and regulation of screen time may solve this issue. Ċ One of the first reasons for increasing crime among youngsters is an excessive amount of violence translated from the news, films and TV series. These sources of information demonstrate a lot of crime scenes that inexorably stay in the minds of young ones. A prime example would be the TV serial called Breaking Bad. Despite the scenes of violence, many teenagers liked and discussed every season of this serial. Secondly, there are some YouTube and Instagram bloggers that encourage youngsters to do law-breaking things. For instance, there was a challenge initiated by bloggers which constituted the idea of punching strangers. Ċ There is a couple of possible solutions for this predicament. Firstly, stricter rules about content in the mass media may greatly reduce the amount of violence seen on the screens. Also, if parents had regulated the time spent by their children in front of the screens, the levels of delinquency would have been much lower. For example, recent scientific studies proved that teenagers who spent less time watching videos on YouTube or video clips on Instagram had a more stable psyche and did not have problems with social interactions. Ċ In conclusion, although the levels of youth crime are increasing because of the mass media, this issue can be solved by the efforts of the governments and parents. This approach will prevent younger generations from the examples of negative patterns of behaviour."
9944,"More and more people today are using computers and electronic devices to access information. Therefore there is no longer any need to print books, magazines or newspapers. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is obvious that nowadays more and more people prefer to use various electronic devices in order to access information. It is a common belief that it is unnecessary to have hard copies of books, magazines and newspapers. In this essay, I will explore the matter and explain why I totally agree with this notion. Ċ Firstly, one of the major reasons why printed literature should be avoided is the massive deforestation of our planet. The urge to own a hardcopy of a certain book is one of the main drivers of paper production companies around the world. A good example of deforestation is that currently, nearly thirty per cent of the Amazonian forests are facing extinction, as well as its fauna. A huge number of international companies are adopting the “green” rules which promote printing only essential documents and transferring from stamping hardcopy to using electronic signatures. Such an approach greatly reduces the usage of paper in the offices. Ċ Secondly, another reason supporting the opening notion is that electronic sources are much more accessible for the population. For instance, it is of tremendous convenience when a person can obtain the required information in one click. Furthermore, it is beneficial to people with disabilities who can not physically go to a newsstand or a book store. Also, more people have access to electronic versions due to lower prices. For example, college student can have all of their books on their computers rather than purchasing and carrying printed versions around the campus. Ċ In conclusion, I strongly support the idea we should try to use soft copies. The main reasons in my opinion are that cellulose producing companies contribute to deforestation and that e-copies are easier to access."
9945,An increase the production of consumer goods results in the damage to the natural environment. Why is this case? What can we do to solve this problem?,"The highly increase in producing consumer goods has triggered the environmental damage. However, using those products is human necessity. Nevertheless, some possible measures could be taken into account to address this issue. Ċ Nowadays, human population in some regions has increased significantly. It is unquestionably that every people have spent a lot of their money to buy consumer goods products for their daily necessity. In terms of cleanness for instance, they use cleaning products such as detergent to clean their dress, shampoo and soap for taking a bath and so forth. They have become the most important items in human life.  Thus, it is undoubtedly true that using consumer goods products is human necessity. Ċ However, an increasing demand to use consumer goods has negative effects to the environment. For this reason, the government should restrict the rules of waste disposal to the factories, then fostering the companies to be greener by promoting solar and power energy and recycling water use and packages. Additionally, societies ought to economize in using the consumer goods products as well. By doing so, the environment will be more preserved. Ċ In conclusion, it is undeniable that consumer goods have taken important part to human necessity in their daily life.  However, people should economize using them and the government had better control the consumer goods company in taking benefit of nature to their business. Therefore, the environment will be protected."
9946,"What distinguishes young people from their parents' or grandparents' generation is a lack of physical exercise. Today's generation are spending far too long playing computer games, chatting aimlessly on social networking sites or simply watching TV, and too little time being active. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this day and age, many have an idea that working out is more popular in elderly populations compared to teenagers. Meanwhile, younger citizens are into social platforms. I agree to a certain extent, however, there are some issues to consider. Both will be examined. Ċ To begin with, it is undeniable that there are several positive aspects of staying online. Firstly, these platforms can provide people to get everything in real-time. The reason for this is that network delivers always inform news via it. As a result, citizens might catch up with information clearly and suddenly. Lastly, inhabitants could have logical thinking from using the internet. For instance, a high school boy is a big fan of adventure games. Then, he plays it as his leisure activity, and finally, he has living skills that play an important role as a human being. Ċ On the other hand, there are a host of negative sides to ignoring exercise. First and foremost, populations would face diseases without difficulty. Such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, and so on. This is because they are less movement compared to calorie consumption. A further detrimental aspect is lacking communication skills. The reason for this is when the younger usually enjoy the virtual site, then those might isolate themselves to their areas. Being harmful to the eyes is a final pain point of this topic. For example, watching Netflix is a cup of tea for a city girl. Then, she watches it all the time, and finally, she gets short-sighted. Ċ In conclusion, I personally agree that several entertainments are the main factor that leads adolescents to ignore movement activities. Nevertheless, it will be better if governments can create campaigns which educate young groups to aware of its beneficial sides and drawbacks."
9947,Many people today buy ready-made food rather than spending time cooking. Ċ What do you think are the reasons for this? Ċ Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?,"In our modern society, only a minority of people would like to spend ages cooking for their meals, while the majority nowadays prefer to buy takeaway foodstuff instead of cooking at home. Whether it is ideal to buy ready-made feed compared to self-cooked meals is certainly up for debate. In my opinion, the advantages of this development definitely do not outweigh the disadvantages. Therefore, the following essay will discuss the reasons behind the phenomenon and outline the benefits and drawbacks of it. Ċ To begin with, most of the citizens tend to purchase cuisine outside from home is mainly because of time-saving. Firstly, take-away saves hours for cooking the food. For example, Hong Kong has known for its long hour of work hour so employees rarely have hours to spend on their meals. Secondly, it takes hours and effort to prepare for a single meal, including purchasing materials and unfrozen food beforehand. Employees are often busy with their work and it is impossible for them to put in the time to do preparation ahead of time. Ċ On the other hand, a ready-made snack provides both advantages and disadvantages to the customers and the environment. On the one hand, eating takeaway food brings convenience to busy residents in cities. For instance, ordering meals on apps has become relatively prevalent nowadays while this greatly reduces the moment for walking to the stores and waiting for meals outdoors. However, this kind of convenience does harm the environment implicitly. As many shops usually provide plastic lunch boxes and disposable tableware, water pollution has worsened considerably due to the undegradable wastes in rivers and lakes. Moreover, marine lives are damaged when more wastes are disposed of in oceans. Ċ In conclusion, the main reason for the development of buying ready-made meals is for saving time purpose. Furthermore, I personally believe disposable wastes from taking away have a devastating impact on the environment and the marine system, though it is more convenient to eat a ready-made snack."
9948,Increasing car usage in many large global cities has caused a number of problems. Some cities have proposed banning private vehicles from the city centre. To what extent do you agree?,"As a result of the challenges associated with the increase in automobiles on the major roads of cities, some believe that the use of personal cars should be restricted from plying these highways. In my opinion, I strongly agree that this ban should take effect sooner rather than later due to problems such as environmental pollution and traffic congestion. Ċ Firstly, cars consumes huge amounts of fuel, consequently emitting carbon monoxide, a poisonous, odourless and tasteless gas, which is harmful to humans. When inhaled, it makes people unwell and subsequently leads to death if taken in large quantities. For example, in a movie I saw recently, a man passed out from excess carbon monoxide in his lungs after sleeping off in his garage with his engine running. Furthermore, blaring horns and sounds from exhaust pipes cause sound pollution, which in turn brings about unrest. Ċ Another point to consider is that the presence of many private vehicles on roads cause a traffic jam. In recent times, people find that at the end of a tailback, there are no visible causes such as accidents or on-going construction work. Rather, this is often the result of the high density of automobiles especially during rush hours. A study conducted by a professor and his students at the University of Lisbon showed that heavy traffic jam on highways are more often than not the cause of congestion. In addition, the ripple effect of gridlock caused by the increased amount of cars is that people waste their time on the road which reduces productivity at work thereby affecting the economy negatively. Ċ In conclusion, the increase in the use of vehicles comes with its setbacks, thus, many municipalities have suggested its ban in the heart of cities. Despite the merits associated with the use of cars, I strongly believe that banning vehicles from main roads in the metropolis will improve the quality of health and safety of individuals which is of utmost importance."
9949,"Topic：Some people think the government should increase the sports facilities to solve the public health problems. However, others think that other measures should be taken to help resolve this problem. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The constant decline of public healthy condition has been an disturbing problem in many countries. Accordingly, the authorities are confused about how to eradicate such phenomenon and ensure their citizen a healthy life. Ċ As a matter of fact, providing the public an access to the sports facilities can relieve this phenomenon to some extents. Due to the restrictions of living condition and financial status, not all communities are equipped with public sports facilities, and not all people especially those from impoverished family can afford the relatively high entrance fee of fitness centre. Therefore, the investment in public sports facilities just provide those individuals a chance to do exercise and keep fit. Ċ However, the enhancement of general public health cannot completely depend on the proliferation of sports equipment. Substantially, the root reason why people are unwilling to do exercise is they are still not aware about how severe consequence would be due to lack of exercise. In current society, modern people are facing high risk of obesity high pressure and heart disease as they tend to spent the majority of time sitting in front TV set and computer, or charting with their friends though telephone. For a long time, they just cultivate a sedentary lifestyle which has no profit to personal wellbeing. Accordingly, the most practical way to encourage individuals to go out for exercise is to raise their awareness and help them mould a correct concept towards doing exercise. Ċ By way of conclusion, enhancing general public health cannot be achieved by unilateral measure, and all that we can do is to address this phenomenon from the root cause and prompt individuals to take actions by various means."
9950,Some people are making new friends by using socializing network websites and internet chat rooms.Some people say that this is a good thing.Others say that people should make new friends by face to face chat. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"The increasing trend of making friends with the help of social sites, such as Facebook, has become a controversial issue.While some analyst believe that this is definitely advantageous for the people, others think that it is more beneficial to widen the network by face-to-face interaction.This essay will discuss both sides of the argument in depth.I, however, opine that real interactions are much safer. Ċ To begin with, there are some individuals who favour networking sites for socialising.This is because, in the present world, everyone has easy access to modern gadgets, such as cell phones, which offer a variety of ways to become social. To cite an example, these days millions of people are connected with each other from websites including Facebook, WhatsApp and many more. In this way people from every corner of the world can send friend requests to anyone and broaden their circle. That is why the advocates of the perspective are in favour of online communication. Ċ On the other hand, a vast majority of people consider that one should socialise by manually meeting with others.Since in these circumstances, if a person actually interacts with another individual, the chances of being deceived are fewer, and in addition, they get to know well.For instance, it is generally seen that the section of the society who spends quality time together shares a healthy bond of relationship and often helps each other in times of need. To recapitulate, they are right in thinking that those who mutually share views are trustworthy. Ċ To sum up, the community is divided on the way of being communalise.Some consider online friendship an excellent way of widening friend circle, whereas another section thinks actual communications have several advantages, I personally go with the latter view as the friends are honest and real in this method."
9951,"""In recent years, many countries have become extremely concerned about the increase in crimes committed by young people. Tough measures and strict punishments are necessary to stop the youth from re-offending. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Write an essay (about 250 words) to express your opinion."" a tougher punishment should be considered","Over the last few decades, there has been a dramatic spate of crimes carried out by the youth that called for more serious and severe punishment in order to ameliorate the situation. Personally, I strongly advocate for applying harsher actions to these cases. Ċ Firstly, as a consequence, recidivism is more thoroughly eliminated. After experiencing a tough punishment, those uncomfortable remained feelings will be effective in preventing any thoughts of re-committing. Moreover, they also play a key role in shaping the unawared young minds about complying with the laws later on in their lives. In short, stricter rules act as a long-term prevention to this alarming social malady. Ċ Secondly, understanding what offenders have to suffer will make teenagers develop their social awareness and responsibility. At the very young age, if students are well-informed about the serious extent of crime punishment, they will apply stricter rules to themselves to avoid acting against the laws. Hence, these kinds of punishing maybe the most practical role models for the youth. Ċ Opponents of my point of view may claim that young people do not deserve harsh laws as they should be given more chances. There are some moral values grounding this statement, however, long-term social security is a substantial drawback. In adulthood, everyone has already been assigned with adequate responsibility and awareness to abide the given rules. What is more, lower level of severity means several crimes are bound to happen again as an obvious result. Ċ In conclusion, with the view of protecting the nations from these incidents, I completely believe that tougher punishment should be brought about in the foreseeable future."
9952,The media news agencies should must include publish stories which report positive reports good news do you agree or disagree.,"These days, Media is vital to share information among the public. The news agencies are including publicity of the stories that are giving the good news of the report. But what is the most effective method for dealing with the positives of a better newscast? In this essay, I will agree to support my opinion with examples. Ċ First of all, the news is adding better information about the society that jobs were doing in the company to get the best results. There are able going on the sincerity, So agencies were following as per rules without any behaviour. For example, one of the best channels in my area like 99tv. This channel wants to see everyone also is being self respective among the social events. Knowledge is given to the people for various persons that are able Skilling for this sector. Ċ Secondly, some press release is followed to be fake, but there will be producing wrong statements. There wants to do crime in the community that why headlines implement too attractive for people. For instance, the TV9 channel is the best rating in the first staring itself after slowing down their investments. Politics members are buying of a variety of communication, but society is facing a big problem. Ċ In a nutshell, although it is a common belief that adding the story of the report that media news agencies. I believe that share the information to give good results. I thinking not to be trusted while their releasing of headlines people."
9953,"Some people believe that it is wrong to keep animals in zoos, while others think that zoos are both entertaining and ecologically important. Discuss both views.","For many people, wildlife parks have become common places of spending a free time with friends and family. Although there are some people who argue against zoos, however, others hold an opinion that menageries are advantageous for various reasons. This essay aims to discuss both benefits and drawbacks of them. Ċ On the one hand, animals in zoos are kept in artificial environments (e.g. cages or other sort of limited space). They rely on humans and therefore, loose their both ability and freedom to hunt for food. Another reason is that zoos exhibit animals with the purpose of making money. Some people claim that human beings have no moral right to use animals for entertainment and profit. Moreover, they argue that zoo animals live in unethical places as well. Ċ On the other hand, there are certain benefits of keeping animals in zoos. Firstly, they play an important role in wildlife conservation. To clarify, zoos can help to protect endangered species of animals. Secondly, zoos are educational, interesting and fun. Children, for instance, enjoy learning from animals and hence, menageries can be very useful for them. Moreover, those places allow scientists to study animals and their behavior. Finally, zoological gardens provide many job opportunities, in particular, for local residents. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that the potential benefits of zoos overwhelm its pitfalls due to the fact that they are interesting, educational and fun."
9954,"Some people believe that an aging population is good for business, the economy, and society. Others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","An aging population is one of the most alarming issues among the countries in this day and age. While I can comprehend why a high rate of elderly citizens is conducive to numerous countries, my opinion is that this trend does more harm than good in the long run. Ċ It is understandable why many people perceive the greying population as a beneficial trend, particularly because the seniors can play an integral role in taking care of their grandchildren at home. As that most young parents are snowed under with their work, grandparents are usually family caretakers and babysitters. My grandfather is a salient example. He used to look after my brothers and me when we were little kids so that my parents could get to work. They even saved a large amount of money as my parents were hardly agitated about sending me to kindergarten thanks to the assistance of my grandfather. He is just one example of the many elderly who become the essential backups for young parent's careers and moral support for their children's fully upbringing process. Ċ Nevertheless, I suppose that the aging population is always associated with the scarcity of the workforce. The fact that people aged over sixty are no longer able to contribute to the thriving of a nation is undeniable. For instance, Japan, Korea, and other industrialized countries are facing a severe loss of labor force due to the rise of the greying population. Therefore, governments have to import overseas workers to burgeon their economies prosperously. There is no doubt that the more elderly citizens in the countries, the worse economic circumstances that many countries have to encounter. Ċ All things considered, for the reasons mentioned above, I would not agree the trend of a greying population is an upside."
9955,Present a written argument or case to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic: There are many different types of music in the world today. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the International music that is heard everywhere nowadays?,"There is little room to doubt that music has been playing a privotal role in our daily lives.However, the debate over whether traditional music is superior to international music has long been in question and worldwide music lovers are deeply divided over this controversy. This essay will elaborate on these aforementioned issues. Ċ First of all,music is the food of our souls.It provides tired minds with a healthy entertainment and opens a way for us to escape from all the hustle and bustle of lives. Nowadays people can't live without music.It's such a magic pill to cure bad moods and heal emotional wounds. Secondly, music can be a stimulus to encourage us to go through the ups and downs of lives. In addition, there are meaningful songs that teach invaluable life lessons and speak up for things that words are unable to describe. Ċ Turning to which kind of music is more essential. I am convinced that although traditional music should be preserved as national belongings, mordern music also plays a significant part in bettering our lives. On the one hand, traditional music represents for a region's identity as it undergoes momentus changes in one's history.Traditional music also contributes a great deal in passiong down cutural heritages to the next generations and helps buit their pride in their mother country's uniqueness.On the other hand, international music brings worldwide citizens closer as through music, mutual understandings and friendship can be attained across cutures and global peace is also developed. Ċ To sum up,music has had a fundamental impact on man kind since the begining of our story and each kinds of music has its own merits which I believe should be treasured and respected equally."
9956,Agree or disagree: People should state their honest opinions even though they know others will disagree with their views.,"Not a topic has ever as heated as whether to voice our opinions or not though we know others might not disagree with our view. Some people have tact and know how to prevent themselves from being criticized in events. Others, nevertheless, do not pleasure others by concealing their real opinion. Personally, I will mention two reasons in favor of my claim.  Ċ First of all, listening to your heart is of vital importance. One who knows to express opinions has a self-principle in public matters, and it helps a lot in many situations. Take my cousin Peter as an example. While he attended for one of an outstanding medical school audition, the judge asked the same question to several people, "" I feel a bit painful with my head, would you tell me about the problem?"" Most of people used lots of professional nouns and analysis to reply any possibility, however, none of them getting into the school in the end. My cousin could enter it just because he answered what his real thought, "" I don't know."" Before he could have the person inspected by some precisely instrument, he would not be sure what the problem is. As a result, Peter became the only person receiving the acceptance from school.  Ċ Beside, the honest opinion will consistently be reminded sometimes though it was not accepted at the beginning of events. The movement of woman's right was sent troops to be punished on initial stage. Yet, throughout a great deal of efforts had done by them and years passed by, people start to listen to their voice and story.  Ċ Finally, former situation has been transferred and now their advocates have shown up at every corner in the world. Voicing honest comments make people feel easy going and non- stressful. Although life will meet some obstacles, it would not stop you being an honest person and saying out of yourself. In contrary, it fosters somehow matters successful which you never imagined."
9957,Some people think that government should focus on environmental pollution and housing problem to help people prevent illness and disease. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is undeniable that people all over the world are facing several issues such as poverty, unemployment, pollution and many more. It is, therefore, some people contend that the state should consider the issue of environmental degradation and lack of houses so that diseases could be controlled. I firmly agree with the notion but it is not only a duty of the territory to save our environment from exploitation, but a common man should also be aware of it. Ċ To begin with, there are quite a few reasons why people demanding that the government should give attention to these issues. Because the province should make a strict law regarding the environmental issues i.e to encourage recycling, reuse the waste products and even reduce the garbage if possible by purchasing less packaging products. Also, limited vehicles on the road, population controlling seminars could work well. At the same time, the state should be built the houses for those who are below the poverty line and just earn for their bread and butter. This step of the government could be worthwhile for homeless people because these kinds of people have to sleep on the garbage sites which ultimately a reason for several disorders. For example, according to an article published in 2018, in India 40% of beggers used to spend their whole days in the railway stations and bus stops due to lack of their house. Thus, the government should make rules to save the surroundings as well as to construct some medium-size house for needy people. Ċ Conversely, why I believe that individual actions are also required in order to address the issues? Even though the state should make some policies, but individually people should put their efforts so that our ecosystem is maintained. People should use only eco bags for shopping instead of using plastic ones, the plastic water bottles for daily basis could be replaced by the installation of water filter at the home. Furthermore, even poor people should arrange their own shelter, it could be a small rental place rather than one's own home so that they can spend their life purposefully. For instance, there has been some recorded instance of people who have following the checklists to protect their atmosphere from the pollution. Overall, residents have the same responsibilities which could not be denied. Ċ To conclude, to face the shortcomings is a common concern among people. However, serious steps could be taken to lessen the effect of the problems, that's why it is the fundamental responsibility of both the governing body and the human beings to putt their efforts at their own level for the environmental protection."
9958,Many people believe that the increasing number of cars in cities is the biggest source of pollution and waste. Others think that industries are the ones causing pollution. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Environmental problems have always been a heated topic since the industrial revolution. A large number of people believe that the rising amount of automobile cause the most pollution and waste while the others think that industries are the biggest source of pollution. In the following paragraph, I will discuss the reasons for both views and conclude with my own opinion. Ċ To begin with, the relationship between an increasing number of cars and environmental issues is understandably established among people for a few reasons. As you might know, more than 90% of cars nowadays are still using fossil fuels, which are eventually turned into exhausted fumes and released into the air in the process of using vehicles. Moreover, broken cars also leave us a tremendous amount of metal and plastic waste which takes forever to decompose. Take the latest model of auto ,for example, it only lasts for about 20 years before it is put into a junkyard Ċ On the other hand, industries are considered the source of pollution as well. Even though most corporations in the modern-day use three-phase electrical power instead of fossil fuels, the process of manufacturing still includes stages that require burning or heating the ingredients. Therefore, factories are still producing emissions that cause the greenhouse effect and pollute the air. For instance, industrialized cities always have a higher level of contaminated air, compare to the rural areas. Ċ Taking everything ,in conclusion, both the rise of automobiles and industries have contributed their part in pollution in the same manner. From my point of view, these factors have to be regulated carefully in order to protect our environment."
9959,More and more people now choose to wear the fashionable clothes. Why is it? What are the positive and negative effects does this trend impose on the society?,"There is a growing trend in the world today that people favoring the fashionable clothes to ordinary clothes,especially for young people .This essay will examine the reasons for this phenomenon and discuss some of the disadvantages and advantages it will have on society. Ċ The main reason of this is that wearing the fashionable garments can capture the attention of the general public,and thus people may feel a particular and superior emotion. That is the reason why the majority of young people tend to show off themselves and believe that unique and costly cloth is what differentiates a person who live in an affluent background.Besides,more and more serious celebrity effect results to this trend.For example,once a wonderful cloths wore or advertised by famous people,it will become the hot-caks that many people chose to buy.So,when consumers buy some clothes,they pay more attention to the novel style of clothes that how fashionable they are rather than the quality. Ċ It is deniable that although wearing popular garments has its advantages such as boosting the development of fashion and making a city keep pace of the modern trend,I strongly hold my view that it has many negative effects we should take aware of.Firstly,there is a mounting trend that more counterfeits are produced by illegal manufactures,since not everyone has the high-level of consumption to buy expensive and popular clothes.Even if this satisfied the person's vanity,the public moral would be influenced negatively.Furthermore,we should recognized that traditional costumes represent a country's culture and history,such a cloth that individuals should do protect and respect rather than ignore.Thus,symbolizing the modern elements and traditional elements is the best way to present what is fashion. Ċ In conclusion,the main reasons of people wearing fashionable clothes are that they can catch public's eyes and satisfy their vanity.Although choosing which clothes to wear is everyone's right,we should not ignore the worries it holds in societies."
9960,It is believed that children from countries with a high level of unemployment should be offered just with a primary education and should not be offered with a secondary education as anyway they will not get a job in the future. Do you agree or disagree with the statement?,"Unemployment has become a threatening concern in many countries. It is often argued that youngsters should be provided job opportunities on the basis of primary schooling while others believe that secondary education should be required. This essay will describe my disagreement on offering work with lower qualification followed by relevant examples. Ċ The first and foremost point is that, education is extremely important in making career choice for a candidate. Besides, it is essential to qualify minimum educational criteria for an occupation. For instance, to have job in mechanical industry one should have complete knowledge of the relevant area. Therefore, these skills can be learned while pursuing higher education degrees where practices are also performed along with theoretical subjects. Ċ In addition to this, children with primary educations can get occupation nevertheless they cannot make further progress in their fields impacting organization productive. To maintain a balance in the workplace, the organization should hire candidates with mandatory qualification. For example, in a workplace, it will be difficult for management to find more competent and skilled worker. Moreover, to increase employment, government can create policies such as early retirement based on profession, because youth is the future of a nation and they can perform more promptly than the senior staff. Ċ To conclude, it is true that employment is a necessity for a youth. I agree to the point that job criteria should be based on educational certifications as higher studies play a vital part in distinguishing between skilled and unskilled labour. However, political establishments should invest more in raising funds for studies and creating employment by promoting skilled jobs. This will improve economic growth of a nation and reducing unemployment."
9961,Some governments spend a lot of public money training individuals to be successful in international sporting events. Some people believe that this money should be spent on things that will benefit the general public instead. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"Community's funds are being spending by the authorities on individuals to impart some coaching to get success in sports competitions globally. Although this notion is favoured by one part of the society, others have a counter-argument that there are numerous problems are facing by the local inhabitants and the government should solve this issue with this wealth. In my opinion, public capital should be spent on the residents first. Initially, this essay will demonstrate that public funds are helping to develop the national resources and then it will discuss the benefits for communities. Ċ To begin with, authorities can improve many infrastructure facilities for their inhabitants with public money. Governments can invest this fund in the progression of roads, bridges, railways tracks and public transportation. This progress leads to the improvement of local sources and their users. As a result, folk will be able to save their time and cost. For instance, a survey conducted recently by BBC News has revealed that authorities of developed countries spend 80% of people's funds on public facilities to build a robust society. Therefore, social developments rely on this fund. Ċ Besides, through public ,wealth several other utilities can also improve. There are major and crucial development requires to achieve primary necessities such as employment, education, healthcare, water, sewerage, energy sources and so forth. The well-being living lifestyle of common people only can be maintained with the support of raising sufficient capital by the administration. Consequently, this advancement would enhance the living standard of people. For example, in the UK 30% of jobless got their job after raising the money to public sections. Hence, this finance assists in various ways to solve plenty of issues. Ċ To conclude, this essay argued that, governments have the ability to tackle myriad problems with public money which will be profitable for the community and the nation rather than individual sportsperson. Thus, I strongly believe that paying public fund to players is squandered of the valuable resource of the nation."
9962,More and more companies are allowing employees to work at home. Do you think this is a positive or negative development.,"Nowadays many companies around the world are improving their labour politics, permitting their workers to work from their houses. In my opinion, technology made this possible and results have shown that it is something good. Ċ On the one hand, reducing employees stress is a major employers goal. Many people spend too much time travelling by automobile or in public transportation. Traffic hours and crowded busses are stressful. So, staying at home increases leisure time that can be used to develop interesting activities. For instance, they can do exercise or spend time with their families. Also, wearing comfortable clothing is another positive change that helps to relax. Moreover, since remotely work is possible thanks to communication, it has increased trust among team members. As a result, improvements made more productive jobs and better work environment Ċ On the other hand, online work could cause quality issues to customers. Some companies have large teams that could suffer communication issues by sharing data through online meetings. For example, some people hide their facial expressions keeping their cameras off. Then, others can not know if they understood the crucial information. In addition, there are more distractions at home, such as kids crying, noisy neighbours and, the TV on. Therefore, some tasks would not be completed at the end of the labour day and affect the client service. Ċ To conclude, there are good and bad this related to employees performance while working at home. Some are enjoying and being more productive while others are taking advantage and developing poor jobs. I think that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
9963,"Some people think tv is good for us, while others argues that television has many disadvantages. Discuss both views.","In this concurrent world, it is undoubtedly true that a small screen plays a vital role in everyone’s life. Some people concur that TV is harmful to health. However, others quibble from them and propound that it is beneficial in day-to-day life. I have discussed both viewpoints along with an example in the upcoming paragraphs. Ċ Adequate evidence is obtainable to substantiate that television is useful. The top-notch concrete reason is very informative. To explain further, individuals can gain knowledge about various factors from where they are. They can learn about the issues that are happening across the world. For example, research conducted in Sydney in the year 2014 has found that more than 60% of society are aware of current trends and affairs around them. Secondly, another rationale that hauls me to patron is for communication skills. To be more precise, the public understands different customs, cultures and even learn different languages while watching television programmes. Besides, they understand how to communicate with others and establish certain skills that are important in life. According to an article published in ‘The Week’, the proportion of people speaking multi-languages has increased from 24% to 78% today. Ċ Finally, the rearmost coherent factor to be considered which cannot be neglected is to learn different dishes. To expound, women learnt many new cuisines by watching different cookery shows. To upload my notion, I would quote an instance of my friend, who learned many dishes which is prima facie testimony. Thus, it is clear that television has certainly undeniable merits. Ċ On the other hand, “What is half full for some, may appear half empty to others.” So, the public, in general, tends to distinguish that it is harmful to use due to multifarious reasons. To commence with, some people deem that spending more time in front of a screen causes eye damage. Withal they also upload that it is the only source for children to score fewer marks in studies. According to parents, the small screen is the biggest distraction for their kids. As a result, these facts indicate the negative effects of tv. Ċ In conclusion, bearing in mind both these sets of arguments, it can be seen that both vantage points have their explanations and support due to various reasons elucidated above, making it a hot topic of discussion."
9964,"These days, too many people maintain their health by relying on doctors and medicine, rather than by following a healthy lifestyle. To what extent do you agree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. People are too lazy to be healthy","Nowadays, people tend to ignore the way of healthy life and both medical treatments and practitioners are used by them to manage their health. Personally, I agree with the former statement because nowadays people occupations are mostly worker which are very busy with their businesses and choose the easiest way for their daily life such as consume fast food and lack of exercise, so it is clearly that the dependency of people to the doctors and medicine is increase rather than following the way of healthy life. Ċ Focusing on the job is one of the crucial factors that causing people does not have much time to maintain their daily routines such as food consumption and less exercise and it becomes a new bad habit for them. Consuming fast food is chosen as the best alternative because the simplicity and they can consume anywhere and anytime while sitting for several hours to finish their job. Consequently, they suffer some serious illnesses such as diabetes because the accumulation of saturation fat on fast food and lack of exercise. Ċ To overcome the problems, doctors and medical treatments are the best solution for them to manage even cure their illnesses. What the common fact they do is hire nutritionists to maintain their food while they still lack of exercise. People also go to the doctor if they will suffer and get prescription to buy some medicine to make their body fit. Ċ Taking everything into consideration, albeit doctors and medical treatments help people who suffer illnesses and help them to maintain their lifestyle such as food and keep body health, avoid unhealthy lifestyle is the most important preventive action to cope up with health problems."
9965,"All education, primary, secondary and further education, should be free to all people and paid for by the government. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Many people think that high education is tending to be inevitable demand in the 21st century. Governments have to specify more money to offer unpaid high education for their people, while others think having some people with primary educations is still important for factories working. I vigorously agree that studying should be free of charge up to high level and will explain my reasons in the following paragraphs. Ċ The illiteracy definition has been changed nowadays, therefore the advent of technology and computer science let knowledge limit extended. The reading and writing ability which was a gate to continue high school 20 years ago is not enough in the computer and internet age. Ċ Talent employees have been needed, who be able to deal with the different kind of sciences including computers, the new physics and chemistry inventions and speak more than one foreign language. Ċ Life tends to be more expensive, in addition education nowadays costs much more than before. A lot of people could not continue high school study, even higher university education if it is paid and expensive. Government should spend more money to give most of its people the opportunity to continue high teaching and bring up new scientists for the future. Ċ Human resources should be on the top of priority of any government's plan to improve the society; therefore, more money should be spent to achieve this goal. Free high education for everyone would lead to wealth community learning, however, we should not wait until the new Illiteracy come over to look for the treatment."
9966,Animals are in danger of extinction. Some people say that we should protect only those animals which are useful to humans. Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays the number of endangered species has reached an alarming stage. While some people think humans should only protect animals which are useful to us, I completely disagree with this idea and I believe we should try to protect all species, even if there are those who think they are not useful. This essay will present arguments to support my opinion. Ċ First, I believe a large number of animals which is in danger of extinction is due to human activity. For example, deforestation and intentional burnings are two of the main factors that made dozens of species disappear. Therefore, there is nothing fairer than protect those animals that we put in this situation, whether or not they are useful to humans. Furthermore, we may think that some species are not useful nowadays, but we are not able to predict the future and some species that we classify as unuseful, will be in the future. Ċ Second, every animal has an important role in the environment. In other words, every single specie is extremely vital to maintain the animal kingdom balanced. For example, the extinction of one single animal can lead to serious troubles for others. This is because every animal has a position in the animal net, while some are preys, others are predators. If one of them disappears , the whole system may be in danger. Ċ To sum up, I believe humans should be worried about protecting all kinds of animals. Not only because they are essential to the environment, but also because some of them are endangered due to human activity."
9967,"Every year, an increasing number of people suffer from fast food related diseases. The government, therefore, should impose a high tax on fast food. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In different parts of the world, it is reported that there is a constant rise in the number of cases related to fast food. While I am of the opinion that the government should issue a heavy tax on this type of food, I also argue that other options could be taken to deal with this situation. Ċ On the one hand, fast food restaurant chains have to pay a higher tax compared to other businesses. The first reason is that this is considered an effective approach to control the establishment of fast food stores. Specifically, a higher tax payment means that fast food owners are unlikely to earn much profit from their businesses. In addition, governments can use the amount of money collected to fund health care system as compensation to those suffering from fast food related diseases, which could help reduce financial burden when they are in hospital. Ċ On the other hand, there are other alternatives that could be taken into account. One possible solution is that governments are advised to organise health campaigns to raise people's awareness of the negative impacts that fast food may cause. For example, the high volume of sugar, salt and fat in French fries, hamburgers or fried chicken will probably lead to high cholesterol or even diabetes. More importantly, there should be strict rules and regulations on food manufacturing in order to ensure the origin of ingredients as well as approved nutrients before reaching customers. Ċ In conclusion, in addition to changing tax policy, it is necessary for governments to draw the attention of customers and put fast food restaurants under control to protect the public health."

I would obtain a chance to go abroad nation then I would go in china. In this essay, I will examine a reason behind, why I want to go china Ċ Although china has a myriad thing to see. First of all, I am going to see Great Wall of china because it includes in seven wonders of the world. Additionally, in the night it looks spectacular and its great attraction for tourists.

9969,Would you prefer to live in a traditional house or in a modern apartment building? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.,"These days, many residents in the big city afford the apartment, while the other choose traditional house to live. Personally, I prefer to live in a traditional house, and I want to examine my choice in two reasons. Ċ Firstly, the consideration to choose place of living is based on the economic reason. In the big city, a modern luxurious apartment is unaffordable. So, we can see city inhabitants who are in the middle or low class favors to live in the traditional house. While for wealth people choosing apartment as housing is preferable. Ċ Secondly, choosing place to stay is depended on personal taste. Even though the modern feature and service of apartment simplify the daily duties, some people feel out of their coziness. For example, whether the door locked or not, does not to be afraid because it is automatically tightens, but wake up with morning with bird tweeting exactly unavailable in apartment. However, living in the traditional house with peaceful atmosphere might be a dream of most of city inhabitant. We should be understood it as an effect of city density dissatisfaction. People are bored with traffic, deadlines, and noisy. So, they tend to relax in the traditional house which is complete with green grass. Ċ In my personal view, living in the traditional house is better. My consideration is about sudden natural disaster like earthquake. As we know, when living in the skyscrapers like apartment, it should take long time to came out in such emergency situation whereas the traditional house is better enough than apartment does. Further, the traditional house has uniqueness in design variation in compare with minimalist style or other modern pattern. Ċ In conclusion, while others have a freedom to decide which suitable place for them to live, traditional or modern, I believe that choosing place to stay in is depend on economical ability and personal taste."
9970,Are higher taxes or lower taxes better for society? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"All individuals pay a part of their monthly income to the government until the retirement period. Government, invest these money in public facilities such as hospitals, schools and so on. Although, higher taxes decrease substantially the monthly income of employees, I believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages as authorities can enhance the public services and support people with special needs. Ċ When people pay higher taxes, they contribute to the enhance of public services. Authorities, has a higher budget to improve the quality of the public health -care system, the education and so on. For example, when government imposes high taxes it is more feasible to recruit enough police-officers to enhance the public safe as well as to hire more doctors and nurses in public hospitals for a better and faster health care-assistance. Therefore, implementing higher taxes is for the common benefit. Ċ Moreover, people with disabilities who are not able to work, governments help them to survive. They are supported either providing them an allowance, or giving them the chance to live in public institutions to get the appropriate cure. This would be quite difficult with lower taxes. Furthermore, authorities would have the budget to support homeless people or individuals who earn low incomes by giving them subsidies. For instance, according to a research which I read on the Internet, nations like Canada who impose high taxes there are enough facilities for disabled people, giving them the chance to survive. Ċ To conclude, lower taxes seem to be better, as employees can save more money in their bank accounts. Nevertheless, there are clear benefits of implementing higher taxes as this strategy improves the quality of public facilities and decrease the unemployment rate because the government has the ability to recruit more people in public jobs."
9971,"What distinguishes young people from their parents' or grandparents' generation is a lack of physical exercise. Today's generation are spending far too long playing computer games, chatting aimlessly on social networking sites or simply watching TV, and too little time being active. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, people have become lazier than their ancestors. The substantial importance of making exercises has sparked over relaxing in recent years. I think this issue is completely true, as now everything can be done without going for a walk. Ċ At the outset, there are numerous reasons why human´s activities have decreased, but the most conspicuous stems from overusing technology. Furthermore, people have no free time to work out, so being overweight has been a serious health problem, such as stroke or heart attack . For example, one century ago, there are no remote controls which are used to change channels, although today people can do everything without moving more than a finger. Consequently, with fewer gyms and too many technological facilities, sickness has been killing many around the world. Ċ Secondly, physical exercises were broadly done at work in comparison with now, in which jobs require mental abilities. Moreover, in leisure time, gaming on the computer is replacing the practice of sports, so mankind has moved less their muscles because of that calories are not burned. For instance, machines are faster and more efficient than humans in the harvest, like other mechanical labour, jobs have been done by those tools. For this reason, governments must aware population of the importance of being active. Ċ To summarize, youngers far outreach the previous generation in making physical exercises. Recently, obesity has overwhelmed human beings as a result of technology and job´s changes. In my opinion, governments must alert the population about those consequences, also non-intentional workout has to be supported."
9972,"In recent years, television has contributed most to changing the quality of life of ordinary people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is believed that in recent years the quality of life of ordinary people has been changed due to the contribution of television. I completely agree with the given statement. I think it has improved the awareness of people about the community. Ċ Firstly, the TV set is the primary source of entertainment, an individual can enjoy watching movies and series without even leaving the comfort of their homes. For instance, instead of going to a movie theatre for watching a movie, I can simply buy an online package and can watch as much as movies of my choice. Secondly, the programs shown are informative which improves the knowledge of people. This enables individuals to enhance their way of living according to the latest trends in society. Finally, we can improve our language skills by watching different news channels. It helps in developing the personality of people. Another positive effect is the encouragement and motivation gained by the students by watching different competition shows. All in all, the TV set is a hub of knowledge. Ċ Moreover, when families watch television together, it helps in developing a bonding among the family members. For instance, in my family, we all utilize our weekends by watching any sports show, any series or a movie together. We also prepare different food items when we watch TV together. In this way, we get ample of time to spend together. Additionally, awareness of different culture also increases. Ċ In conclusion, I would say that television has improved the quality of people by providing an enormous source of entertainment."
9973,Some people are of the opinion that children should be rewarded for good behaviour. Others think they should be punished for bad behaviour. Discuss both views and give your personal opinion and reasons.,"The minds of the children can be shaped during the early years of their life so caregivers have to be cautious about their behaviour. A few people ponder that offspring should be presented with a reward for showing the best behaviour while others postulate that they should be punished when they misbehave.This essay will discuss both sides of the argument in detail and provide evidence as to why I am personally in favour of motivating a child when they behave in a good manner with everyone. Ċ On the one hand, proponents of giving reward to a child claim that continuous encouragement will have long term benefits. Children’s immature minds are not aware of ethical or moral principles so when they are motivated for a certain action then they get a better understanding about it and they continue to do so thus leading to a good habit.For instance, we often hear that “sharing is caring” , this habit can be seen in most of the students in school where they share the meals and stationery items with their classmates. Teachers find this as a small step in the positive behaviour hence appreciate the students for the same.Therefore, any reward in the form of words, patting or a present will always promote optimistic change in a child’s habits. Ċ On the other hand, some parents believe that punishing their offspring for misbehaviour will restrict their sons and daughters from repeating such kinds of actions. Most of the children show stubbornness and do not listen to their parents so the only option left for a mother or father is to show strictness for the betterment of the child.For example, a recent study by Children Welfare Council in the USA shows that 30% of teenagers use abusive language and bully others as their actions were ignored by their parents during a young age.This has a detrimental effect on society as some of them may choose the path of various crimes due to teenage rage and anger.As a result, it is paramount to teach and guide the child during the initial years even if it requires to punish or ground them. Ċ To conclude from the aforementioned arguments, I would like to infer that if a child is closely monitored during the younger age when they develop habits by encouraging and rewarding them for positive actions like respecting and helping others then it will never lead to bad outcomes in future. Methods like punishment should only be considered if all the other ways to improve their behaviour fails."
9974,now i comeback with the second time taking ielts test. hope my writing improve ielts writing task 2 - advertisement positive or negative effect,"Nowadays, advertisement has bombarded people with various images and videos on technological devices and publications such as Television, Smartphone, and Newspaper. This trend brings about both positive and negative effects on humans life. Ċ On the one hand, it is undoubted that advertising has numerous significant benefits financially and socially. First of all, advertising provides customers with a large amount of products' information, which helps them to make better shopping choices. This also means that buyers can choose the product that works best for them. When it comes to social meaning, the advertisement might raise people awareness and knowledge about products development as well as cultural and social problems. For example, Adverting viewers can discover more about technical gadgets through smartphones or Laptops advertisements, or a lot of brands use storytelling with meaningful messages about family, dream, country, and so on to introduce their products to the customers. Ċ On the other hand, advertising also results in several severe impacts on both companies and customers. First of all, companies have to spend a large amount of money on advertising. Because of this, apart from the cost of manufacturing, customers have to pay for the advertising cost, too. Another drawback that directly affects customers' spending habits is that advertising will encourage people to buy things that they do not really need. Take the iPhone as an example; some big fans of this brand always desire to own the latest version of this kind of smartphone, although their certain phone is still in good using condition. This leads to a waste of money and natural resources, or further will contaminate the environment. Ċ In conclusion, advertising can be a good source of information for smart buyers. Still, at the same time, it can pose a serious threat to customers' benefits as well as the environment if people are not fully aware of its harm."
9975,More and more people these days overwork. Overwork has caused several problems. What are they and how to tackle this problems?,"These days, people in modern life increasingly overload because of working too much. However, overloads has lead to many issues. There are two main problems, limitation in both physical and mental and being a positive person. Possible solutions would be spending hours on outdoor activities and look on the bright side. Ċ First, one of the main problems is that overwork can cause limitation in both physical and mental. If they usually have to get high pressures at work, their body would alert them by some signs such as sore eyes, headache, weak memory, so on. This condition lasts long every day that becomes diseases such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, so on. Consequently, they cannot task effectively. For example, when they task regularly without taking a break, their brand would run out of energy and then it is exhausted, so they cannot concentrate to make a good decision as well as complete works in right time. To tackle this issue they should spend more time to support outdoor activities including sport club or, hang out with friends on the weekend or take a trip on vacation. Thanks to some activities, they will be relaxed and recharged the battery for the next challenge. Ċ Second, another problem to consider is being a positive person. They always hope to do well and when the failure at work happens, they have to deal with severe stress, including disappointment from employer, high risk of the sack. As a result, they may become a depression people. For instance, if they are leaders, their projects of the team would decline because they would be frightened to suggest a resolution. One possible solution is for workers to look on the bright side and they should receive some advice from employees to escape this bad mood. Therefore, they are able to solve any challenges and get more confident and optimistic in life. Ċ In a nutshell, exhaust can cause some issues, including limitation in both physical and mental and being a positive person. Many solutions are spending date on outdoor activities and looking on the bright side. It is suggested that they should arrange a time to work and rest reasonably in order to improve health for the job."
9976,"Someone believes that modern telecommunication devices have many benefits to human, while others think otherwise. What is your opinion? Please discuss and use examples to support your own ideas.","Some people think that new telecommunication tools have many positive impacts to citizens, but others do not think so. In my opinion, new telecommunication tools support many people in every subject of life, and people can connect with other personality appropriately. On other hand, such gadget as new tools can give negative impact to children. Ċ To begin, the most famous of communication purpose is developing of human life especially in communicationmajor. Old people always need to communicate with their relatives' family or their partner. Communication tools were made by human and for a better of human life. For example, gadget is the best telecommunication today, we can use it for browsing internet, sending message and making video call. We are not only use it for communicating but people can also saving the data or calculating, people can do many things by their gadget only in the one hand, because gadget has small body and high technology. Ċ On the other hand, adult people have to pay attention to children. The purpose of modern technology is not arranged by children because they do not know how to use gadget in right ways. Sons and daughters only know that they can play many games in gadget, they also do not know about the negative radiation. For instance, as I know that children have spent much time with their gadget to play games actually their eyes will against, several time ago, I met children that he has particular red eyes because he played gadget over 3 hours. Ċ To sumup, discovery aboutnew telecommunication tools are improving human life. These tools will be useful equipment if citizens know how to use it."
9977,"Nowadays, sports is a big business with high earnings for professional sports people and companies involved both financially and other ways. Is this a positive or negative development for sports? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 250 words.","It is often argued that playing games in a group such like football were a more beneficial portion, while others believe that isolated sports are the best way like swimming. In my opinion, I believe that both of these options can help to develop physical activities, and that optimal choice depends upon the specific career a person is interested in. Ċ First of all, it is widely recognized that obtaining group games is essential for some events in certain professions. This is because more people can participate in one game and this can lead to sharing their ideas. For example, the team physical creations such as football, cricket and basketball help to get ideas from others, and also used to communicate with each other. Therefore, many people suggest that playing sports with the whole team was a unity experience. Ċ On the other hand, it is clear that individual meetings are more beneficial for others. A key reason for this is that a single person can expose their performance and get individuality from outside people. For instance, sole meets such as athlete, swimming and high jump etc lead to put effective hard work and achieve great success in their chosen field. For these reasons, tournaments alone are useful to show our individual performance without any help from human beings. Ċ In conclusion, both team and isolated tournament experience can be an important role in successful sports. The choice of which one to follow will depend entirely on the individuality and their career goal."
9978,Most modern family have both parents working and as a result children spend less and less time with their parents. Ċ What is the reason for this? Ċ What problem can this cause?,"In this contemporary world, the gender difference is contracting tremendously in recent years. Many latest family includes both senior ones involved in professional sectors, due to which they obtain less period to spend with their children. This essay will highlight a major foundation, and a repercussion caused by this situation. Ċ To begin with, nowadays money is an essential factor for most humans, and to receive high wages, they work extra hours with less leisure time to spend with the family and children. The status of an individual is determined by his bank balance and the properties, provided that most people work strenuously to earn the money to enhance their value in the society, but are unavailable for their own children. To illustrate, a survey taken recently by the Nepal Children Society stated that 39% of the younger ones suffer from depression or other mental illness, due to a workaholic parent. Therefore, allocating time for the minor one is extremely significant for any parent, and they must have a balanced personal and professional life otherwise the impact will be massive. Ċ Furthermore, without a supervision and a guidance from the elder ones, a child has a high potential to involve in the bad companies, and inculcate a harmful habit. The minor ones are very innocent, and are unable to acknowledge what is right or wrong for them, so such phase is extremely crucial, and every parent must guide their child to lead a right path, and have a successful life. For instance, the Malaysian Children Rights Authority stated that 46% of the children are engaged in drug abuse or criminal activities, because the parents are always busy with work or other events. Thus, such issues must be prevented beforehand, which might have harsh consequences later on. Ċ In conclusion, the parents must have the capability to balance their personal, as well as professional life and should constantly guide and supervise their children. A child is the future of the family, so good values and habits are extremely crucial."
9979,"People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen. What is your opinion about an ideal society ? How can we create an ideal society?","Almost everybody desires to live in an ideal society. Though many have already attempted to create one, we have not succeeded in forming a perfect environment.In my opinion, an ideal community means that there is no crime offended and the best way to achieve this is by educating the younger generation with all morals possible. Ċ Firstly, nations whose incarnational rates are low get regarded as one of the happiest countries in the world.When people are self-disciplined and completely avoid committing sins, instead of respect and love each other, the area remains in peace.For example, Switzerland,Finland and the Netherlands are among the very few territories which have low-crime rates and known for their richness.Also,the law-breaking rates are very low in the aforementioned places.Thereby, in the world's happiness' index, they get nominated as one of the peace-loving countries. Ċ Furthermore, educating children from their younger ages and supervising them are beneficial approaches in developing an ideal civilization. To illustrate, if we see most of the delinquent's biographies, they were not taught with moral values and ethics in their early childhood, so as a result, they have turned as culprits in future.So it is apparently vital that the Government must take necessary action towards training the children with good thoughts and to be devoid of criminal activities. Ċ To conclude, I view an ideal society as an image of Finland, Norway and Sweden, affluent and have low-crime rates. Therefore, I reiterate and state that cultivating the positive thoughts and good-will among kids will be the best way to act upon the goal of forming a pleasant neighbourhood."
9980,Some parent believe that learning mathematics at school is redundant and should not be taught while others believe that it should remain a foundational subject whether or not it is used later in life. Discuss both sides.,"Studying mathematics in school is considered a redundant discipline, as some parents think, while others believe that it is a fundamental subject regardless of whether it will be used in the future or not. On the one hand, the opinion that mathematics is an unnecessary field of studying at school has weight because computers are used everywhere. On the other hand, some believe that mathematics lays the foundations for logical thinking. Ċ Some families believe that the world has changed, and computers are replacing humans when it comes to doing math, so students' study will be superfluous. Computers have become part of our lives, and they are always around us, helping us solve any problem from counting purchases in a supermarket to making financial reports. Moreover, using the calculator on your phone, you can solve complicated mathematical problems, such as engineering calculations and formulas. For example, we have now developed an application that allows you to measure buildings' dimensions and make calculations using your phone. Therefore, many believe that the computational process can be given to a computer and is unnecessary. Ċ Other parents believe that mathematics is an integral part of logic and that this is an essential aspect of our living. Mathematics is associated with reason because logical theorems are proved by using mathematical formulas. For instance, IQ tests examine mathematical reasoning, and it is believed that the higher the level you have, the smarter the human. The reason is critically important in a person's ability to exist in the modern world since, without it, an individual cannot live in society. In extreme cases, it can lead to the isolation of a person from others. Therefore, mathematics can be an essential aspect of our life. Ċ In conclusion, based on the above facts, we can conclude that the computer can perform many functions for us. Therefore, the study of mathematics may not be a compulsory subject at school, but at the same time, mathematics is an integral part of human functioning, and this is a critical ability for life."
9981,"First of all, let me introduce myself: I am preparing for the Toefl. My weakness point is writing. This is the reason why I am here: to improve my writing. Hope you can help me with this task. Thx in advanced.","During our lives people pass through several stages. Each of those stages has some remarkably moments. However, in my oppinon, childhood is the happiest time of a person`s life because we do not have too many responsibilities, enjoy to our parents and grandparents and we are looked after by our parents. Ċ First and foremost, childhood is similar to no responsibilities. As long as we are growing, we have more responsibilities and duties. Think about it: when we were adolecents we had to study harder in order to had great notes and grades, then we had to find a job and so on. Yet, childhood was only about playing with your family and friends. We were happy with any kind of toys or plays and that was beautiful. Ċ Furthermore, we have to our parents and grandparents with us. my grandparents were a strong influenced for my and I missed the time when they try to explain me everything. I remember the time when I travelled with them and spending several days far way from the city. I just smile when I remember those days and I do feel that I was happier than any other time in my life. Ċ Last, but not least, there is an imporntant issue to this point: we feel protected. Our parents gave us not only many material things, but also their protection. According to recent researches, protection feeling is one of the most relevant aspects when we are childreen because the sensation of confort can stimulate our brains to give us happiness. Ċ In a nutshell, I strongly believe that childhood is the happiest time of our life. Many reasons can be thought, but for me the principals are related to my memories, the lack of responsabilities and the sensation of comfort. So, I agree with the statement."

Thus, some people have the notion that it is crucial to spend more time in their careers, work harder or even longer to get promoted. However, some feel that social life with family and friends is paramount. It is disagreed that climbing the corporate ladder is the most essential part in our lives.

They claim that extreme working and neglecting their loved and close one will deteriorate their social lives. As a result, they are likely to have tenuous relationship with their family and friends. When they face any problems and obstacles, they have no one to listen, support and guide them. Over time, their social network become wither and die. Ċ In conclusion, although having a successful career is important in our lives, we should always strieve for a balanced lifestyle. Hence, it is sometimes thought that having all the money in the world and not sharing with our loved one does not make us the happiest person."
9983,"Many things can influence the academic achievement and emotional growth of a student. In this regard, peers have more of an impact than teachers do. To what extend do you agree or disagree?","Many people have valued the role of classmates on a student's school performance and emotional development over that of teachers' impact. In my opinion, I profoundly disagree with those people as both of them are equally essential for pupils. Ċ On the one hand, the influences of teachers on the comprehensive development of pupils are strictly necessary. To begin with, the most common role of teachers is to teach learners all necessary knowledge they need in school and give them homework to do at home. Additionally, they encourage undergraduates try their best by creating competitive environment in classroom. Therefore, in the long term, they achieve more academic goals. Moreover, Teacher not only educate their students, but also listen and talk with them when they have a problem. For example, as a veteran being, they can give adolescents useful advices when they have just broken up. As a result, young learners will easily overcome that situation and become more mature. Ċ One the other hand, fellow classmates also take an equal role to a student's academic improvement as well as the development of his emotion. First, they motivate each other to perform better in schools. In fact, pupil tend to make more effort if their peers complete better than they do. As a result, they increasingly accomplish in school. Second, classmates help young learners grow emotionally by providing them with new ideas, beliefs and experiences. This can help students develop a better ability to control their emotions and get along with others. Ċ In conclusion, I suppose the significance of fellow classmates and trainers can not be brought into comparison to see which one is more vital since they have distinctively equal meaning to a student's comprehensive development."
9984,"Many people say that universities should only offer places to young students with the highest marks, while others say they should accept people of all ages, even if they did not do well at school. Discuss both view, and give your own opinion.","Tertiary education is essential for achieving success in life. Students, who get high band scores, usually get a chance to admit in universities, though older students and having a low-mark in school life should also be gotten excess into the higher education. From my perspective, all types of students both youngest with high-mark and adult students with low-grade must have a right to earn knowledge from universities. Ċ On the one hand, pupils who earn standard marks in all his academic life, easily get admission at university. The reason is that professors at tertiaries think that since the student has achieved the highest position at school, he must have worked hard. Eventually, he will do a better result in higher studies, and cope with the workload and activities-related universities and its teachers. For example, in school, the top-rated students are disciplined and efficient so that they do their tasks efficiently and listen what their teachers are focusing on. Therefore, the dean of tertiary education selects those brilliant students who could do excellent results. Consequently, this selection generates a higher level of citizens, and socioeconomic will be strong for these intellectuals. Ċ On the other hand, each student has the right to study at the university level. It is justifiable to say that if all students get a higher education, any nation will develop immediately. For that reason, universities should give chance to age-students as well as pupils who obtain the lowest marks at school due to the advancement of a country. For instance, in the USA, the renowned universities such as Harvard or Yale - provide their admission form for all types of students, but they should have a quality which could be anything whether skilled at sports, art or higher marks gained in the school certificate. As a result, no one is unemployed when university graduates get their certificate from tertiary education. Ċ In conclusion, it is a controversial issue about whether universities should focus on selecting the top-rated students from intermediate level, or, whether they should select senior learners who did not cut a good figure on the previous exam. In my opinion, both types of students must be selected by the university for the socioeconomic growth of society."
9985,Some people argue that space exploration has had more to do with national pride than international effort. To what extent do you agree with this? How do you think space exploration will change in the future?,"These days we could have been heard about ground-breaking achievements of space exploration almost every day such as having found water on Mars, new earth-like planets. Many put forth the idea that national pride is the best reward and respect, while others contend that international collaboration is more preferable. To me, I totally agree with the latter and the future of space exploration also is discussed in this essay. Ċ Co-operation between countries plays a vital role in developing space technologies at a breaking neck pace for two below reasons. First of all, greatly contributed and shareable knowledge not only helps scientists avoid squandering valuable time to reinvent the wheel but also puts researchers on the right track to success. Secondly, space experiments always consume a large amount of money, resources and efforts which no individual country, but an international community could afford to pour assets into. Without this collaboration, wasting and lacking of resources is a great hindrance that every individual country must tackle with, which set back the development and success. Ċ On the other hand, a joint development could prevent a space race between superpower nations. During the Cold war period, Eastern and Western Bloc had a tough race for landing astronauts to the Moon which almost pushed the whole world on the brink of new war - the world war 3. Ċ Breakthroughs in material science, the computational power of quantum machines, great achievements in artificial intelligence and the most important warp technology would shape the way humans explore through galaxies in the near future. At that time, we will not only make friends with other species but also new challenging and adventurous horizons await for humans to discover. Ċ In conclusion, international effort has been taking the lead in guiding the space developments on the right track and actualizing our desire to travel through galaxies will be coming soon."
9986,"Teleworking ""Teleworking"", or the use of telecommunications to allow people to work from home, should be adopted by all employers in order to improve the quality of life of their staff.  To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement ?","At present, ""teleworking"" is the positive trend. However, I totally disagree that teleworking is applied for all kind of jobs. Ċ I admit that teleworking has good advantages. Firstly, teleworking help employees don't have to go to workplace, especially the employees who has a long distance to the firms. Secondly, employers have the less expenses of worker's transporting. Hence, company's budget will be saved. Lastly, all of the parties may interact easily by technology developments. For example, Japan is one of the nations which apply ""teleworking"" program. Thanks for this, workers can make ends meet right at home, and the traffic jams which is serious problem of ""The land of Rising Sun"" is reduced. Ċ On the other hand, there are some resistances if workers work at home. They will not have time enough to complete the tasks. For another way, the times for job will not be used efficiently, because the employees have to do other things. For example, the female workers which get married and have a child, beside they work at offices, they have to do the housework, such as cleaning, feeding. They don't totally focus on the work. Eventually, employees productivity will not be better than working at firms. Inspire of interaction, employers don't find easy to manage their staff due to they are not at workplace. If the employees work at firms, the atmosphere will be considerably improved, the staff may talk to each other, and make friends easier. Importantly, the efficiency of work is made sure. Ċ In conclusion, ""teleworking"" is a quite impressive idea. However, the efficiency of this model depends on characteristic of work or administrative ability of employers."
9987,"Some people believe that to protect local culture, tourism should be banned in some areas whereas others think that change is inevitable and banning tourism will have no benefits. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Tourism has been becoming an economic cornerstone of many nations in the world, which can have both positive and negative influences on some areas. There are different views on whether tourists should be prohibited to visit several places in order to preserve the culture and traditions there. In my opinion, a visit to tourist attractions should be maintained without prohibition. Ċ On the one hand, tourism activities have been ruined or damaged numerous spots in term of local custom and tradition. Many people visit a destination and pass other assortment of values, beliefs or behaviour, permeating the locals' deep rooted cultural beauty. The residents would adapt to the new and neglect what they have been used to but still been invaluable. Moreover, many religious events take place while visitors come to snap some fabulous photographs or communicate noisily about the event. Those types of behaviour can drive the indigenous to distraction from the important situation. Ċ On the other hand, in the main many areas from cities to villages count on the income from touristry. In other words, people residing there take advantage of tourist attractions all year round. For example, in Con Dao island, many families or individuals launch various services to support tourists who arrive there mainly for spiritual purposes and financially support themselves, which means if the island is devoid of visitors, a number of residents will suffer from poverty or income reduction. Banning travels seems not feasible to protect the island' traditions as the indigenous have been working on this effectively and wisely. Ċ To sum up, retaining traditional local culture is as significant as developing tourism; however, a ban on tourism in some spots cannot be an appropriate approach to fulfil this goal. This decision must be considered disservice to the locals in some aspects."
9988,Most high-level positions in companies are filled by men even though the workforce in many developed countries is more than 50 percent female. Companies should be required to allocate a certain percentage of these positions to women.,"Now we are in the era of trade, where every individual want to achieve high level position in their work place. However, the most of the organizations prefer male candidates to be managerial level even though there are more than halve of the employees are woman. People think there should be reserve some portion for female. Hence, I believe that the main goal of companies is to earn profit rather than allocating the men and women. Ċ In 21st century, men and women are equally engage to take the responsibilities of business organization and perform as a good team together. To lead the company, employee should have some special qualities. For instance, leadership, communication, and good educational background such kinds of skills are necessary to compete for managerial level position. But the scenario is little different, most of the company prefer male candidates on the higher position. Since, male staffs have adequate time to perform their duties in office. On the other hand, women have more obligations toward their family and our society have very narrow concept towards working woman. They believe that only men can able to handle the financial and decision making part of company. Ċ However, some of the companies have very positive view regarding working women. They give equal priority to women in such higher position. They thought that women can better understand employee emotions and their obstacles, they can motivate them to be honest and enhance the work efficiency. Similarly, women have more perfection and dedication then men towards their work. Ċ In conclusion, men and women are the part of a same coin. They have their own qualities and specialties. I believe that there should not be any discrimination between male and female by their gender on the process of selecting employees. The qualification and abilities should be give as first priority rather than gender."
9989,Some of the people believe that video games are useful for children while others say these games have harmful effects. Discuss both views,"Some people say that virtual games are worthwhile for kids, whilst others say that they can cause negative effects. This essay will discuss both views. Ċ The first opinion of this issue says that video games bring benefits to children. Firstly, video games can gain creativity. Some adventure plays are hard to solve and it demands deep logic and instinct to find a way to get the rewards. For example, Lego harry potter that appears in iPad, in some stages, it requires the participant to think out the box to get the clue to finish this step, and it is very hard for children who do not like to think differently. Secondly, it is the pleasure that they get after they finish the challenge in those virtual worlds. It likes an accomplishment of their hard work by using their logical thinking that beyond their daily basis. Also, it can be used as entertainment to relax after a tough day at school. Ċ However, some may think that virtual play can bring drawbacks that jeopardizing the future kids. One of the main issues is the kids' mental health. It supports by the fact that young people that spend most of their time with this digital world have a physiological disorder. For instance, it is very common to see some adolescents from 10-20 have emotional problems, such as excessive anger, that lead them to be a nonchalant and an anti-social individual. Therefore, this group of people has a problem with maintaining their relationship with other human beings and it becomes a really big problem after they are an adult. This occurrence can generate many communication problems in the workplace and lead them to suffer in crowds. Ċ In conclusion, although the drawback is quite gruesome for the children development, the positive effects are wholesome for brain development. So, as long as we are careful to keep the importance of face to face interaction and limit the duration of playing games, the virtual play can be totally useful."
9990,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should require students to study many subjects in different fields rather than just their major subjects.,"Nowadays, universities require their students to study a gamut of subjects in different fields rather than just their major subjects. Yet it is an inefficient method of education and needs to be changed. I believe universities should not make their students to study many subjects in different fields. Ċ First, it is easier for the students to focus on a single subject rather than a wide range of subjects. Completing a major requires a student to study significant number of courses in a particular area. If they have to study more number of subjects, focusing on all of them will be a task. For instance, a student of majors in architecture when forced to study subjects irrelevant to her field will be unable to focus not only on her major subject but also on the other subject assigned by the university. This would hamper the grades of the student and also her state of mind. Ċ Second, majoring in a subject makes one a master of that area. This provides a better career prospects for the student. The companies while hiring will know that you have special expertise of the subject and they will provide better growth prospects. However, if many subjects are forced upon a student and if the student somehow manages to complete all the subjects, it will still hinder the student's career aspects. For instance, if a company is hiring a candidate with Java skills it will prefer a candidate with majors in programming rather than a candidate with generalized resume. The company will presume the latter candidate to be jack of all and master of none. Ċ All in all, it is always preferable for the students to study in their major subjects rather than a wide range of subjects in different irrelevant fields."
9991,"Tittle :  climate change is now accepted threat to our planet, but there is not enough political action to control excessive consumerism and pollution. Do you agree","I agree with the opinion of the tittle. One of the dangerous threat to our planet is climate change. Several causes of this threat are excessive consumerism and pollution. Political action is needed to control this situation. Some countries around the world never pay more attention about what things cause the climate change and what effects will occur. Ċ The economic growth are more important than the damage of the nature. The need of modern lifestyle has made the industry grow uncontrolled. It also has given a big pressure to the government in charge. These industrial activities give a bad effect for climate but in the other side they give the profit more to the country, as economic view, the business will be rising. Other causes, like cars, houses and any other kind of consumerism, also take part of this problem. This condition surely put the government in a hard-choice. The rules made by any political action was not strong enough to regulate this serious problem. Most of them think that the economic growth is absolutely most important than the condition of the environment. Ċ As we realize that this condition will make new nature problem, for example ; global warming, rising sea levels and unpredictable weather patterns. It is impossible to control without government's helps or political actions. A country can rule and limit the number of industry, if the government takes part and keeps an eye of this case. Ċ to protect our earth needs a political action made by the government and any involved parties. They should make the rule clear, limit the number of factory causing pollution and give a high tax for any kinds of consumerism. By this way, we will be able to reduce the climate changes problem."
9992,"Many different countries have most shops and products as the same. Some think that it is a positive development, whereas others consider it as negative. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The need for good food and lifestyle is paramount for every human being to live a good life. It is common for people to choose a business for a good income. It has been observed that the things used in industry are almost the same no matter what the country is. In my opinion, there are advantages and disadvantages, which have been discussed in the following article before I conclude. Ċ On the one hand, the main advantage of parodying the process of selling goods to your shop is the popularity of the goods. This is because when an item is sold internationally, the fabricated company benefits significantly from it. However, it is impossible to sell a good product without proper advertising. For example, for heavy sales of that item, it is necessary to have every prevalent seller, a branded computer, when the company puts it on the market for sale to maintain the presence of that product with each of its vendors so that the product can be sold when needed. Thus, manifesting the product through a good seller can be justified for a good sale of that product. Ċ On the other hand, disadvantages of advertising one type of product may include a lack of perception about the other product. In other words, when only one product made by the company is advertised for sale, and the same goods are found in every shop, the use of small but profitable goods will be denied. For example, the Maruti brand car is widely used in India, but the lack of notoriety for its brand carburettor has a detrimental effect on its economy. Hence, the popularity of less marketed merchandise ought to be admired for acknowledging their significance. Ċ In conclusion, with both contentions in mind, I opine that although there are several benefits to using the same type of material, the most influential of others is its consultancy should not be denied. Therefore, the sale of every kind of product must have its own significance."
9993,"In many parts of world, children are given more freedom than in the past. Is this a positive or negative development?","Childhood is considered to be the most beautiful one of life seasons.Nowadays,the privilege provided for young people is more compared to those given to older generations. This evolution can create both good and bad manners in heir. In my opinion, parents should provide freedom to these young groups under certain conditions. Ċ Firstly,the changes in lifestyle have significantly caused a drastic change in the way we treat children,resulting in more freedom to this peer group.This phenomenon will help them to know more about the world.For instance,kids are allowed to carry mobile phones and through which they can learn new things.Secondly,strict parenting will eventually break the soothing bond between parents and offspring, so freedom is an essential thing for them as well.This will gradually help them to understand how they should handle each situation in life. Ċ However,the world keeps on changing, so unconditional flexibility may ruin this peer group. Child abuse cases are increasing at an alarming rate so a threshold should be set by guardians themselves for their day to day activities.For instance,they should be advised to reach home within a particular time. Furthermore, there are certain points where the heir should be restricted.For example, usage of alcohol, smoking if parents are doing this in front of kids automatically it became a habit for them as well. Ċ In my opinion,flexibility is essential for young people to become independent individuals,but it should be within a threshold limit and that limit should be determined by guardians themselves.By way of conclusion, the flexibility offered to young people is in such a way that it should not make them feel that they are under the control of their elders at the same time the elders should monitor them as well."
9994,"Some people believe that the salaries paid to professional sports people are too high, while others argue that sports salaries are fair. Discuss both views and give your opinion. sport stars are making a fortune","Sport events such as football liga and other sport competitions are enjoyable to be watched by viewers and spectators. Professional sportsmen have become very popular and their salaries are a lot of money. Ċ Some people think that professional players earn too much when their huge salaries are compared with scientists or researchers who are responsible for important factors. However, sports professionals are paid by their ticket sale of games and professionals have different salaries due to their performance. Ċ Most people who argue that their salaries are justified consider that successful professionals are very few, and the high salaries are realisation of their skills and success. Career of professionals can last for a short period. There are a lot of sportsmen compared to successful professionals. It needs a lot of skills and time to become a talented sportsman. Ċ I think that huge salaries are deserved by professional players. Their performance which requires hard work gives more motivation to spectators and viewers. There is a saying ""No pain, No gain"". They work very hard in order to achieve good results. For instance, My hero is Lionel Messi who is the famous player. He faced many difficulties in his life. He had a groth hormone deficiency. But short players are not allowed to football at all. He defeated his disease because of his trust of becoming professional. I think that these type of people deserve to earn a high salary. Ċ In conclusion, I think spending much money for sport stars makes value on the sport and motivate people to be a sportsman or enjoy watching sporting events."
9995,Some people think elderly employees are more useful to a company while others believe younger employees are better. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is thought by some that elderly employees are more useful for a company, whereas other people contend that younger ones are better. In my opinion, I totally agree with the latter view. Ċ On the one hand, there is one reason why several people think that elderly workers play a more useful role in a company. Employing elderly workers assists a company in saving money and time on job-related training. This is because they are normally more proficient in jobs and have more work experience, compared to young workers ordinary having insufficient time in order to implement what they have learnt to practice jobs and having not lived long enough to experience numerous incidents involved in jobs. Therefore, the elderly work more effectively and resolve most problems without attending job-related training frequently, adding up to the fact that an employer does not have to invest money and time in training new workers. Ċ In spite of the aforementioned arguments, others and I believe that young employees are better. Firstly, they can make more contributions to an employer. Unlike the elderly normally considered as married, most young employees are unmarried and can devote most of their time, for they do not need to spend time on family. Secondly, in a high-tech society, the young become more helpful. Nowadays, many companies are adopting new high-tech technologies to enhance productivity instead of employing obsolete ones. Despite having more work experience, elderly workers tend to do what they are accustomed to and hardly learn to use these new technologies. Nevertheless, The young learn the new technologies easier owing to being inherently curious about new things. Ċ In conclusion, although the idea that elderly workers are more useful for an employer sounds reasonable, I am in favor of the idea that younger ones are better."
9996,"Nowadays, the number of crimes committed by young people in major cities throughout the world is on the rise.What are the reasons? Give some solutions.","It seems to be an increasingly widespread problem that crimes are committed by the youth and I think mass media and family structure are definitely responsible for this. Ċ A number of factors contribute to the juvenile delinquency and it is obvious that media the most powerful drive. Vulgarity and violence is shown on TV as profit-pursuing television companies want to attract more viewers. However, children are more vulnerable to offensive images than adults and accept them as nature and try to copy what is shown. For example, in Boston USA, a 13-year-old boy killed 30 students in his school after watching a TV program. Ċ Another critical cause of crime is the changing family structure. Compared with nuclear families which are the norm of the day, the joint families in which grandparents used to teach moral values to children in early years have their unique advantage. Moreover, grandparents could also help keep an eye on the friend circle of their grandchildren. The fact that parents today are both working and children are left unattended at home makes these adolescents may fall into bad company and resort to drugs and prostitution under peer pressure. For drugs are desperately need money which turns them towards crimes. Ċ In order to tackle this problem, in other words, to let the media provide children more appropriate TV and reduce series filled with detailed description of crimes, some censorship is needed. More importantly, joint family pattern should be encouraged and parents should spend more time watching TV with their children so that they know what their children are exposed to. Finally, government should try and reduce unemployment and poverty which are the root causes and promote well-rounded education."
9997,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer,"There is an opinion that sports hold equal importance in the lives of grown-up individuals and kids.I support the given view furthermore, I even believe that games are more needed for the minors than elders.The aim of this essay is to articulate my perception. Ċ I agree with the given statement, it is because of the fact that a healthy lifestyle is important not only for toddlers but also for grown-up individuals.That means games are important for the little ones for their bodily development ,whereas, for the adults, they are required for keeping their body fit and energetic.For example, cycling improves the leg muscle strength for infants and for adults, it decreases their extra calories.Thus it is helping both.Therefore, I feel that sports are to be taken by kids and elders. Ċ Additionally, I opine that playing is are more crucial for the pupils due to the fact that their physical, as well as mental growth, depends on their bodily moments.In other words, the more active they are the more growth we can see in them.For instance, it is easily seen that kids who do not spend their time in any kind of game are seen to be less active than the infants who play a lot. In the case of the adults, they can even go to a gym and do exercise to be fit.However, games are the only choice for toddlers to grow and be healthy. Ċ To conclude, it is true that games are important for both children and adults and I completely agree with it. Moreover, I feel that engaging in gaming activities is more necessary for children than grown-ups."
9998,"The pie charts below show the average household expenditures in Japan and Malaysia in the year 2010. Ċ Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.","Natural beauty spots are being lost in many nations due to the increase in population size and urbanization. There are many advantages of preserving natural places of beauty such as attracting tourists and promoting a healthy ecosystem. This essay will shed light on the benefits of protecting nature and the solutions to achieve them. Ċ First of all, tourism helps boost a country's economy. People from all over the world travel to witness and enjoy the natural history and charm of a country. For instance, Cherai Beach in Kerala, India, known for its frequent dolphin sightings, has welcomed many visitors from all over the globe, who also wanted to enjoy peaceful swimming in the natural waters there. Furthermore, preserving the natural habitat helps keep the ecosystem in balance. For example, the koalas in Australia were near extinction due to deforestation a couple of years ago but time management has now preserved this endangered species. Ċ To achieve this goal of preserving nature many steps can be taken. Firstly, the authority can enforce strict laws which include individuals paying a huge fine for disobeying state regulation. For instance, the government officials in Dubai has introduced a fine for the disposal of waste anywhere than in the place for which it has been assigned . Secondly, celebrities can help spread awareness through their actions. For example, at their UN speech recently, all the members of the K-pop BTS had worn upcycled clothes as a statement for promoting environmental awareness. This encouraged many fans to consider doing the same and become more environmentally conscious. Ċ In conclusion, overpopulation and urbanization are a growing threat to the destruction of natural areas of beauty; however, there are many actions that can be taken, both by officials and individuals, to protect the existing natural ecosystem."
9999,"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In the past, young people depended too much on their parents to make decisions for them; today young people are better able to make decisions about their own lives. Young People's Dependency on Changing World","These days, people have different opportunities to take action about any situation more than the past. However, some people think that young people are still dependent their parents like as the before. These people who think young people are still dependent their parents have some aspects such as economic dependence and constant cultural values. Ċ Firstly, the main reason why young people are still dependent their relatives is economic dependence. Young people study at high school or university. They need money to take care of themselves. However, they have a busy schedule and challenging lessons their school life, and even they want to earn money harshly they could not make money because of their busy schedule and hard lessons. So that, they should take money from their parents. For instance, a student who is studying medicine away from her home country needs money to make a living. She cannot work any job because of her busy schedule. Her family help her to study so that she will depend on her parents. Ċ Secondly, another reason why young people still depend on their parents is constant cultural values. All countries have various cultural values about different subjects. Individuals who have cultural values teach children their cultural values on children's earlier lives. Children grow with their cultural values. Consequently, they will have the same opinion about different subjects like their parents have. For instance, a person who raises with the idea that we should pray before eating for gratitude God will continue to pray after he left the homeland. He will still depend on his parent's belief. Ċ As a result, some people think that young people still depend on their parents. These people have strong points such as economic dependence and constant cultural values. If someone wants to be independent should study hard much as the past."
10000,Most scientific and inventions and discoveries are worthless and only waste time and money resources. Ċ To what extend do you agree or disagree?give your own opinion,"Researches are like a boon for any nation or for humans, but many of them are not valuable and can be wastage of time and wealth. I completely disagree with the notation since because of scientific development humans are succeeding as well as the world. Ċ Firstly, the findings of such great discoveries take paramount time and it is capital driven, but has excellent conducive because it connect us with many undiscovered stories. In other words, archaeologist or astronauts spend their entire life in the search of the secrets behind the life and the future. Which is why we are advancing in since we know about the past civilization and the truth is reliving about the function of the universe. For example, The University of Chicago, says that because of the research we have explored the ancient culture and also knowing the fact about each planet in the sky. Ċ Secondly, technology has flourished from the leap to bound and our essential for the growth and proliferating the human life for future like the invention on the internet. Because of which people are staying connected with their love one not only that, but with just one click a person can explore and find the recourses which interest them. For instance, according to a survey conducted by The Times of India, 90% of people say it is a blessing for them that the science is flourishing since it is benefits to us in many ways. Therefore, invention or discoveries are needed for the advancement of human growth. Ċ In conclusion, scientific development is the need of society and they are not a waste of time. Since it had given us many great invention and it connects us with the past and the secrets of the future."
10001,Many people believe that the increasing number of cars in cities is the biggest source of pollution and waste. Others think that industries are the ones causing pollution. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In recent decades, cities, especially metropolises, have faced more pollution than ever before. As a result, a controversy has arisen over what is the primary reason behind this predicament. While some people attribute it to the marked increase in cars, others would contend that the chief among all causes is industrial activities. From my perspective view, the latter is more accurate although conveys, undoubtedly, cause a detrimental effect on the urban environment, the catastrophe industrialism brings in its wake is much more disturbing. Ċ To begin with,emitting harmful gases into the air has been one of the serious issues nowadays, cars have always been considered a danger to cities. The gravity of these problems, nonetheless, has been alleviated thanks to significant alterations. Hence,electric cars are going into publicity as a substitute for conventional pollutant cars. The government, furthermore, is determined to take an environmentally friendly approach by allocating more expenditure on public transportation, which culminate in a decline in the number of cars. Consequently, the side effects of overusing cars are going to be marginal in the foreseeable future. Ċ In stark contrast, never have been urban districts experienced such industrial growth in history. On that account, the modern lifestyle which consumerism plays a major role in, leads to a marked boost in the construction of factories, with the aim of providing a wide range of multi-coloured products for consumer society. Besides,having occupied the suburbs, factories are likely to encroach into the heart of cities in the future. However,If it happens, cities’ degradation will occur. Unfortunately, not only does this damage ruin cities, but it also brings long-term consequences to the ecosystem in the shape of global warming and the extinction of species. Ċ In conclusion, both cars and factories are generally culprits for cities’ pollution. Yet, I vigorously opine to the industrial issue is the pivot in which the catastrophe turns. Thus, it is indeed that the mechanical sector has contributed to the domain of pollinated climate."
10002,Individuals should not be allowed to carry guns as it increases the crime and violence in the society. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"As gun violence has been increasing in society for the last few decades, it is often argued that revolver ownership should not be allowed to common people. I support this view to a large extent since this may prevent getting rifles into the wrong hands. This essay will support my views and give a proper conclusion at the end. Ċ The one main reasons are if guns were used by mentally challenged or criminals, the repercussions would be tremendous. Because of the ownership, this allows the owner to use firearms for self -defence. However, currently, the opposite is true: there are many gun violence incidents in the USA, where keeping a licensed rifle is very normal, for example. Unfortunately, many culprits fire revolvers against innocents in order to escape from crime scenes. Ċ Secondly, freedom of rifle ownership is outdated when mankind at risk of being attacked. In other words, rarely do we see a country with a free gun policy that is peaceful, and many sociologists have been requesting to the world leaders to stop issuing weapons' licenses to citizens. Although it may argue that the piece of equipment also uses for entertainment, mostly this may not be the case. To illustrate this, even young school children shoot at their fellow classmates with their parents’ pistols, so the depth of the issue is evident. Ċ In conclusion, I firmly support prohibiting access to handguns to citizens as it is essential to save the lives of innocent people. It is predicted that if possession of deadly weapons did not control, it would kill thousands of humans."
10003,Everybody should be allowed admission to university study programs regardless of their level of academic ability. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Continuing study at university is a dream for every student. As such, people have same right to apply subject of study to college without taking care about academic achievement. Although there are pros and cons in this statement, I personally agree with this statement as it can reduce bribes for student who has not enough level of academic capability and also it cannot be guarantee of student favorite subject. Ċ Academic-ability qualification could help students to choice the best academic way for them as this ability is the most important factor to determine their comfortable subject in university such as all of universities in Indonesia requires the certificate of academic level to select the proper student for the correct course. As a result, people can easily improving their real skill. Ċ On the other hand, there are many reasons why degree of academic capability is not essential. First of all, every person tends to bribe university employees for allowing them study at college as some people have a big motivation to study but less academic capability such as bribes are often happen in many universities in Indonesia. Furthermore, this level does not be guarantee of favorite subject which can make student has good motivation to study because although they have good skill in one subject, but they do not enjoying it. Take an example, most of students in advanced country is recommended to choose their favorite subject not their good capability of courses. Ċ To sum up, degree of academic ability does not predominant for entering university as it will cause bribes and it reduce student's motivation. Therefore, I prefer agree with this case."
10004,"In the modern world, it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via the internet, and live without any face-to-face contact with others. Is it a positive or negative development in your opinion?","Nowadays, shopping, working and interacting with others through internet-based applications have become common over the world. In my opinion, this positive trend is because of various reasons related to convenience and effectiveness. Ċ To begin with, because of the affordable price of smart devices and the development of many eCommerce platforms with user-friendly interface, there is much convenient for shoppers to search and purchase their favourite products with just a few clicks on laptops or through mobile applications on their smartphones. Compared to traditional trade, on which people need to spend hours going to the stores and browsing items, this shopping method offers them better experiences. Additionally, top eCommerce retailers such as Amazon and Alibaba always commit delivery timing and quality of the goods distributed by them with money-back guarantee to help people shop confidently. Ċ Furthermore, it is also much easier than ever before to manage and to achieve working tasks, without staying at the offices, even if these works require co-operation, as modern communications technology enables employees to keep in touch with their colleagues instantly. For examples, from the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft have published a free team-working apps called MSTEAM, which allows managers to assign tasks to their subordinates, and can be used to organize a conference with up to 50 members and high-definition video quality. By working this way, the corporations keep their working schedules as normal while giving employees the space they need. As a result, the effectiveness of the works could be enhanced. Ċ In conclusion, using the internet to buy products, work from home and interact with others is a modern and effective model that enhances people’s experiences and improve their productivity."
10005,"There is evidence that inhaling cigarette smoke causes health problems not only for smokers but for non-smokers who inhale other peoples smoke. In view of this, smoking should be banned in all public places, even though this would restrict some people's freedom of action. What are your views? Give reasons for your answers and include any examples. Write at least 250 words. Smoking ban in public places","The fact that smoke from cigarette not only harms the respiratory system of smokers but also that of passive smokers, leading to a suggestion of smoking ban in publicly used areas. While some people see this ban as restriction of freedom of action, I do not share the same point of view and in this essay, I will be presenting information that will help to support my opinion. Ċ To begin with, it is noted that prohibiting smoking is only applicable to the public area, but not any of the private place, such as bars and restaurants, as these places are privately managed by its executives. If this law had implemented, people who wish to smoke can still have the rights to do so, and thus, not impeding their liberty. Ċ Apart from that, undeniably, smokers have fewer places to choose for taking the tobacco. Yet, the rule on smoking is in fact concerning a greater issue: the well-being of most citizens. Health issues have always been the worldwide matter, but this requires actions from everyone. It seems to me that it is worthwhile to sacrifice or limit a small portion of people's choices on where to smoke, maintaining the health of most of our valued citizens. Ċ To conclude, making smoking in the open areas illegal would be a smart decision when we put the healthiness of the majority into our first priority, because smokers contribute only a small part of our population, and these people can still smoke in other personal sites. The lawmakers should also understand that protecting people's health is far more important than fulfilling the will of a small percentage of people."
10006,"Some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reduce traffic accidents. Others, however believe that other measures would be more effective in improving road safety. Discuss both views give your own opinion","People have different views when they are looking for a method to ensure the safety of vehicles and pedestrians. I believe that the answer for this question should be the combination of punishments and range of measures. Ċ On the one hand, strict punishments can certainly help to ensure to drive more safely. Harsh penalties for careless driver prevent them from repeating their offences again. The most serious penalty could be prison sentence of up to 5 years. The aims of these punishment is to warn dangerous drivers against breaking the rule, furthermore, raise their driving habits. As a result drivers would be more careful behind the wheel and more disciplined. Ċ On the other hand, safe driving can be better in different ways without the need of punishing drivers. I believe that government should spend more money on upgrading public transportation which might lead to fewer people travel by cars. One thing that is noticeable about children is that they can be easily educated than adults, traffic law should be added as a part of education sectors in primary school to raise the road safety awareness. This is significant that traffic signs should be placed along the road in order to give drivers adequate time to respond to the command. Ċ In conclusion, while punishments can prevent bad driving and make drivers worry about payment. other road safety measures should be conducted into reality. It would be more effectively if we put them together to make a huge effect on road safety."
10007,"Some educationalists argue that non-exam, art-based subjects, such as music, drama, art and craft, should be compulsory in the secondary-school curriculum. They believe that activities such as these can improve overall academic performance. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, some pupils are not confident to express their feeling about something, include their argument. The way to build their confident is a must have curriculum about art in the second-grade school. I would agree with this statement to some extent because I believe that it help students achieve good ability in soft skill. Ċ Definitely, the secondary-school's subjects have advantages for improving student's creativity such as arts subjects, with the aim of balancing the student's intellectual beside study about exam subjects. One of them is to teach students about teamwork, for example drama. This may help students to enhance their leadership skill for managing their team. So, they can do the best in their performance. Otherwise, they will finish this task in a long-term. It seems, can have negative influence on students because their exam subject is overlooked. Ċ Some may argue with non-exam subjects are not as important as exam-subjects. They think students have to study about Maths, Physics, Economics and etc to get properly job after they graduate. Then, they assume that study about art seen only as fun and spend much money to buy some propts. In any case, exam-subjects can improve student's soft skill too. For instance, communicating skill, they can explain about what problem surround them. They also have to learn to produce some researches which give benefit to the society in the future. Ċ In the end, art subject can be accepted as compulsory subject if it brings positive role for students and make their parents proud with the achievement. Alternatively, exam subject as an important subject should be given attention for students because without this subject academic performance will be imbalance."
10008,"If you could travel back in time to meet a famous person from history, what person would you like to meet? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.","There are many remarkable people in the world. These people have done many things, such as composed songs, invented tools, and so on, to make the world are better place. The most favorite person that if I could go back in time to meet, I would like to meet Albert Einstein. I will give several reasons to support my opinion. Ċ First of all, Einstein was a scientist who invented many great theories such as relativity, quantum physic, and the formula that every know is ""E = MC squared"". Thus, I would go back in time to meet Einstein. The reason is that I would like to talk with the greatest scientist in the world. I would like to know that what would it like to talk with people that had highest IQ in the history. I still wonder that whether he speak like normal people or not.

I would like him to teach me anythings, any kind of knowledge such as science, philosophy, politics and any things. It would be great to get knowledge from the smartest person in the world even if I could not understand it at all. I would so very proud to be Einstein's student. Ċ In conclusion, if I had a chance to go back in time to meet a remarkable people in history, I would like to go back in time to meet Albert Einstein. Because, I personally think that he was a greatest scientist in mankind history. Therefore, it would be my greatest experience to talk to him. Beside, I also would like to be Einstein's student. Thus, if I could meet Albert Einstein, I would be so proud and it would be my greatest experiences."
10009,18.  Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Playing a game is fun only when you win. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer,"Some people believe that playing game accompanies with fun just when they win. Others, however, think recreation and playing games are always attached to each others. In my point of view, the latter's group idea is more authentic due to some significant reasons being discussed in this essay. Playing game is an effective activity for encouragement. Playing game almost often has important learning conditions. Ċ Encouragement is such a vivid consequence of games that all men can enjoy from playing. Although some people play a game when they are sure about their triumph, I for one cannot neglect the encouragement effects of playing games. For instance, John, my roommate who is an expert chess player, always wants me to play with him. Frankly, I am novice in this game, yet I have accepted his suggestions all the time because of the fact that by playing chess, I encourage myself to improve my skills. In addition, researchers at the MIT University, who focus on the role of games in the child characteristics, confirm that playing game increases the sense of encouragement up to 15 percent between children. Ċ Furthermore, that learning conditions appearing during each games are another benefits of playing games. As a tangible example, when I play with John, I have this opportunity to learn many things from my competitor. How to make an important decision at the right time and how to manage my facilities to struggle with difficulties are other achievements that I can gain with games. Ċ To wrap it up, playing a game is often fun either you win or not, but the other aspects of game should be considered. Encouragement and learning situations are also the two remarkable features of game. We can learn many things from game. Even if I have not won the John till today, I will play with him to learn all of his strategies and after that invade for the final hit."
10010,People do different things to stay healthy. What do you do for good health? Use specefic reasons and examples to support your answer.,"Health is must to enjoy the life to the fullest. For me it's even more necessary. Because I believe fittness is key to sucess for a physcial therapist. For staying healthy I do three things first of all starting my day with meditation and light yoga; preperaing my own healthy food and; jogging for half an hour in the evening. Ċ Being a physical therapist I have leared proper techincs of yoga and meditation. I also know the advantages of it. In the early morning, starting with ""pranayam"" I enjoy the fresh oxygen. Slowly with light yoga aasanas like ""bhramari asana"" I stimulate my brain and body. With some other poses like ""surya nameskar "" and ""pawan mukat aasana"" I get flexibility and strength for the body to resist whole day exertion. After that I finish it with ""shav aasana"" which relaxes the body. Ċ Food is also very important for good health. I prepare my meals by myself. I try to make it completly filled with all the required nutrients. Lot of salad and fruits are always part of my diet. I believe it is also necessary to eat hygenic food. For that home made food is the right choice. Ċ Thirdly and most importantly, jogging for half an hour is a routine for me. After I am back home, I want to get relaxation and need fresh air. For that I love to jog. Advantages of it need no discribtion. I jog for half an hr and after that 5 mins of cool down. I love to spend time near my park, watching small children playing. Ċ I do these three things religiousely to keep myself upto the mark in my personal and professional life."
10011,Technology has changed the way people communicatr today. Some people belive this is making our relationship stronger while others believe it is harming them. Discuss both points of view and give your own opinion.,"Advancements in technology in the past decade have been dramatic. Many people argue these vast changes lead to a decrease in human contact. Others think it has helped in making our relationships stronger. In this essay, I will examine both views and state my onlook on this problem. Ċ First and foremost, every household in this era has a smartphone. Applications like Whatsapp, Viber and WeChat have made communication easier than ever before. This way families and friends can not only talk to each other instantaneously but also virtually see them. Moreover, wireless gadgets like phones are portable and have location trackers which means, people are always accessible. This feature is especially crucial in emergency situations. For instance, by dialling 999 the police can immediately track you down and be at hand to help. Ċ On the other hand, these robotic devices are thought to be the number one reason for the surge in depression and loneliness. ""Let's sit down and have a cup of tea"", is a saying we hear very seldom these days unlike in the past many crave the basic human touch or just a warm hug. Smartphones, laptops are tablets have produced a generation that at a glance might look together but deep inside are a million miles apart. Ċ To conclude, I believe technology has strengthened relationships by providing a medium for portable and accessible communication. However, the negative impacts these devices have on peoples mental health is disheartening. As we all know nothing in this world is good if taken in excessive."
10012,Some people think technology is better for improving the environment than living simpler life. Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, the quantity of innovation is rise and rise because of scientists` effort. While some people consider technology ought to make people`s life simpler rather than to protect and improve the environment, I suppose that technology plays a dominant role in the field of environmental friendly. Ċ It is no doubt that our living environment has been damaged for many years. Especially in last century, government encouraged manufacturers to enlarge the scale of manufacturing blindly regardless of heavily ruining living environment. Therefore, technology, which is allocated uncountable money in, should pay for its initial responsibility-correct ancestors` wrong decision. At least, it is expected that new technology is able to better the environment as comfortable as a hundred century ago. Ċ Moreover, with the development of science, innovation cannot meet our requirement today. Since a great number of problems involved environment are yet tackled, such as the over-rely-on the fossil fuels and discharge of waste water, technology has long way to go. First of all, high-tech innovations are proposed to find out new, clean and economical resources to alter the exited fuels, reducing CO2 and H2S. Second, purifying the waste water is also crucial. Either cleaning the materials before manufacturing or purifying the remains before discharge can address the problem efficiently. Last but not least, the efficiency of manufacturing should be enhanced, decreasing the time of producing so that can reduce the polluted air emission from the factory. Ċ In conclusion, rather than simplify people`s life, technology is expected to improve the environment. Only having better living environment can human being live healthier and longer, an achievement that is more significant than anything."
10013,"Which way do you think is the best way for a student to make new friends? Joining a sports team, b. participating in community activities, or travelingă","Nowadays, students have various methods to meet new friends. While I accept that students can easily make friends through sports games and travelling, I believe that taking part in community activities is the best way for students to make friends. Ċ On the one hand, sports provides students with opportunities to play with friends who have similar interests. Each player can build a strong relationship with others by playing within a same team, although a student has to be really good at a particular sport. In terms of taking a trip, we have seen that students can meet a wide variety of friends during a long journey. For example, in a tour bus, students can make friends with other passengers ranging from businesspeople to university professors. Although travelling is a good way to meet new friends, it is unaffordable for most students due to its time-consuming and expensive. Ċ However, students have lots of chances to make a wider scope of friends in various community activities, including the Christmas party and community services. For example, by working together in a Christmas party, students are more easily build solid bonds with other participators, compared with in a highly competitive football game. Furthermore, students are more likely to make healthy friends in community activities, which can prevent students from falling into criminal and undesirable activities such as drug-taking and teenager-sex. Lastly, community activities can be both entertaining and engaging, which offer students a better setting to start a conversation with a good friend. Ċ From what has been discussed, it seems that participating in community activities is a best choice for students because these activities provide youths with a wider range of friends, more good friends and a better surrounding."
10014,Some people think that famous people can help international aid organizations to draw attention to important problems. Others believe that the celebrities can make the problems seem less important. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Popular individuals often endorse different charity institutions. Although it is claimed by some folks that celebrities are able to assist global charity institutions by publicizing critical issues, other public thinks that the engagement of renowned personalities in international aid groups is only diluting the significance of these difficulties. This essay will discuss why celebrity involvement is more important to spread the information of any problems, despite having a few reliability issues. Ċ To begin with, being a role model to society, celebrities can bring any issues to light more effectively than anyone else. Since celebrities can easily attract the attention of commoners, they can pronounce about growing difficulties in society. For instance, Sakib Al Hasan,a superstar cricketer of BD, has been working as a country representative of UNDP. Consequently, now, the public is more aware of the activities of UNDP. Thus, owing to massive acceptance to general people, celebs can be more successful in promoting any difficulties while working with the donor organizations. Ċ On the other hand, individuals are usually less likely to believe any statement of famous persons, due to their extensive involvement in commercial promotions. When people watch television advertisements or any other forms of promotion, they tend to skip or avoid these ads because of their exasperating contents. For example, as individuals often confront with the many commercial promotions of Sakib on television channel, sometimes Sakib’s announcement of donor organizations might be skipped by the public. Therefore, messages of celebs might be less reliable and often neglected by the general public. Ċ In conclusion, superstars are frequently endorsing different donor organizations. This essay discussed why celebs involvement could create more impact on the folk than making the issue trivial. In my opinion, famous persons have the ability to raise awareness about any growing matters in a society, so that they should participate more actively in spreading any information to the public."
10015,"employers' priority when choosing somebody to work. While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.","Employing the right person for the position is one of the key elements which makes companies more competitive. I believe that hirers should prioritize not only candidates` academic credentials and previous work experiences, but also their characters. Ċ On the one hand, it seems quite reasonable to hire the people whose qualifications are in line with the actual job. In fact, some occupations require specific skills and talents which necessarily involve a huge commitment. For example, for being a qualified doctor, one should get proper education and have at least 1 year of practical experience. If the recruiter fails to find the person who is a good match for the requirements in such sensitive jobs, it may have a negative influence on the reputation of the company in long-term. Ċ On the other hand, I think that personality should be taken into account while hiring a new worker. There are some jobs that are based on team work, while the others are more individualistic. That is the reason why character should play an important role for companies when they have to decide whom to employ. For instance, programmers don`t need to be sociable and talkative , whereas if you are planning to work as a salesperson, you should have excellent communication skills. Personally, when I was working as a salesperson, it took me quite a long time to adapt to the team spirit because of my introversy. Ċ So, in my view, both professional and personal qualities should be considered main criteria by the interviewers when they asses the candidates."
10016,"Prompt: ""Stereotyped beliefs have the power to become self-fulfilling prophesies for behavior."" Note-The tone appears a little less personal/stern in this essay, but I purposely did this because my common app essays are about humanitarian efforts and my music ( A flowery essay)","Stereotypes reflect the innate human tendency to conveniently group objects based on certain arbitrary characteristics. By constructing prototypes of different ethnicities, humans attempt to neatly organize their world into proper and improper, accepted and unacceptable, intelligent and idiotic, and a host of other groups. In reality, the complex variances between individuals are far too subtle and diverse to accommodate a stereotype. Ċ I view stereotypes as disrespectful not only to stereotyped groups, but also to society as a whole. A stereotype destroys an individual's true characteristics and replaces them with an inaccurate set of beliefs constructed by other individuals. Unfortunately, viewing a group from a biased perspective may actually elicit the stereotyped response, causing a self-fulfilled prophesy which pours fuel into the fire. Ċ From a global perspective, the saddest part about stereotypes is that they mar the beautiful diversity of the human canvas. Social diversity allows people to explore, grow, and mature by examining the beliefs and characteristics of other individuals and groups. Regrettably, stereotypes have stymied individuals from truly understanding each other, and the extraordinary qualities of many individuals have gone unnoticed under the crushing weight of the stereotype. Once people believe that a certain group can accurately be characterized through a stereotype, they no longer have any incentive to learn what differentiates the members of that group. The stereotype, which destroys singularity under a suffocating blanket of vague, inaccurate generalizations, promotes a distorted view of reality that is hard to erase from society. Ċ I firmly believe that breaking stereotypes requires a liberal and open mind. Approaching people without preconceptions will ensure that their true selves show through without the hindrance of the self-fulfilling prophesy. Thus, I always strive to maintain a broad, unassuming mindset because it allows me to understand and appreciate diversity and not the stereotypes that permeate society."
10017,"Some people view teenage conflict with their parents as a necessary part of growing up, whilst others see it as something negative which should be avoided. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There is no doubt that adolescence can be a difficult period for both youngsters and their parents. Although some people believe that conflict at this does more harm than good, I would argue that it is an essential stage of teenagers’ development. Ċ On the one hand, those who believe teenage conflict is harmful might argue that it can damage relationships between parents and their children. This is because such disputes can create tension in the family. To illustrate this point, it is quite common for young people to begin smoking at their age to impress their peers, but the resulting confrontations with parents can lead to difficulties with communication afterwards. In contrast, if there is no conflict between parents and teenagers, there will be a much greater sense of happiness among family members. Ċ On the other hand, my view is that this conflict is important because it can help teenagers to mature. The reason for this is by having disagreements adolescents can form and develop their own opinions. For instance, a child may grow up in a family of meat-eaters but feel very strongly about not eating meat. If this child does not voice their opinion, they will be going against their principles. However, if they are willing to engage in conflict with their parents, their conscience will be much clearer despite the agony of the argument. Ċ In conclusion, despite the danger of damaging relationships which teenage conflict can create, it is my firm belief that this time of friction is a vital step on the path to teenagers becoming mature and independently-minded adults."
10018,People are not paying attention to environmental protection. What is the cause and suggest solutions to deal with this issue? ANSWER:,"Despite the acknowledge of human about how serious the environmental problems are, we now seem to concentrate on something else, rather than on the persevation for the natural world. There are a number of reason causing this issue and each problem needs to be dealt in a particular way. Ċ It is likely that one of the most prominent cause giving rise to this problem is people now could earn a lof of money by exploiting natural resources at the hard-line. As a result, they almost neglect to save environment. In addition to that, in some countries, especially developing countries, there is the lack of serious efforts and law enforcement on environment protection. For instance, punishment to the ecosystem destruction is not determent and radical. Ċ Eventhough this issue is more and more consideralbly increasing throughout the world, there are some realizable solutions to cope with. Firstly, governments should apply the mineral exploiting standard to prevent misusing natural resources. As well as, authorities need to promulgate some serious laws to reduce the devastation and make all types of sectors in soviety coordinate more closely in protceting global environment. Furthermore, when every individual recognizes how serious the environment effects on their own lives, they will take interest in enviromental protection. Ċ To conclude, the profits from natural resources make people ignore to preserve natural world. However, the opportune interference of government could prevent the environmental destruction."
10019,"Teachers under the critical eye Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Others think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","The argument that supporting would-be undergraduates to be outspoken and critical to teachers if needed to boost academic development is surging. Others said its consequence would be moral degeneration in class. Both viewpoints will be considered prior to my insights as follows. Ċ Obviously, allowing tertiary students to be vocal in commenting or criticising teachers benefits learning process. Students and teachers will express their opinions equally and create productive classes. Additionally, instead of being indoctrinated, students perceive the world by their reasoning with teacher's help. For example, my art class design projects online and exchange ideas or even constructive feedbacks with tutors. Ċ On the other hand, entitled to criticising teachers, students will increasingly break the rules and show blatant disrespect to their supervisors. Since there is no clarification on how much intensity should be placed in a critique, students may unconsciously cross the line and demoralise educators by extreme criticisms. This would certainly degrade social system and threaten mankind. Ċ The common belief that everyone is entitled to their opinions is necessary in our free and fair society but I think it remains underdeveloped in class. The matter is there are students who oppose another's ideas use the phrase: 'well, it is just my opinion' without any elaboration. Thus, I believe to forward academic qualities, it is prerequisite that students provide justifications of their arguments predicated on rationality and evidence rather than bland assertion. Ċ Briefly, interaction between students and teachers is regarded as the major strategy to achieve superior education paradigm. Students can amplify their voice on issues or supportively remark teachers. However, providing students understand that it takes times to learn from mistakes, they will manage to perform better and support their teachers."
10020,Q.  Today's teenagers have more stressful lives than previous generations. Discuss this view and give your opinion. big pressure on youth today,"Although the standard of living has improved in the modern age, yet teenagers are going through the strain in their lives unlike in the past. As time is changing, more and more children are experiencing pressures such as financial, academic, social and peer pressure as well pressure due to poor time management. I believe some of these pressures were also present in the past but they were not too strong back then. Ċ Teenager of modern age is more stressed due to financial burdens. With the passage of time, more and more families are falling under the poverty line. This has resulted in stress in young children as they are directly affected by this. Furthermore, today's youngsters are experiencing stress as to perform better, compete with others, examinations, homework, getting admission in good college and meeting their parents' expectations are common these days. Ċ Another source of anxiety in teenagers is to get accepted by peers and social competition. They have to participate in certain groups, keep themselves updated with latest fashion trends, trying new things such as smoking, drinking and sometimes drugs. when they try to be what they are not, it becomes hard to maintain that image and exerts mental pressure on them. Also, adolescents of our time suffer from stress owing to poor time management. They do not have time for breakfast, school, homework or for playing games. They get interrupted easily by modern day technology like mobile phones and computer and are left with little time to do important things. This also results in extra stress. Ċ In conclusion, the modern-day teenager feels more strain due to pressure at school, financial stress, meeting social needs to remain accepted by peers and their inability to manage time well. I believe that these pressures were also found in older times but they have become more powerful and apparent currently."
10021,Some parent offer their school-age children money for each high grade (mark) they get in school Do you think this is a good idea?Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"Students should be encouraged whenever they achieve a higher grade. However, some parents offer money for each grade they get in school as an incentive. Although I agree to encourage students, I believe giving money for each high grade makes students dependable and it is not a sustainable approach. Ċ When a child receives money for getting high grades, she or he become dependable on getting money. In other words, if parents no longer pay him, the student will lose his incentive for getting a better grade. As a result, he becomes a conditional person which is not an appropriate personality. Additionally, this approach makes the child thinks that he should get better as long as his parents pay him and when his parents are no longer available to pay him, he will stop improving and become a useless person. Ċ Parents cannot pay the student forever because as they pay him, he becomes more greedy and wants more money. This is a popular attitude in many individuals that make this approach inappropriate. This approach also makes the student ask for money for other things he does well, like doing his home-works or even going to school. As a result, parents cannot continue doing this forever. Ċ In conclusion, giving money for each high score is not productive and won't make students an independent and competent person. This approach only makes them a conditional and greedy person which is not favorable in the society."
10022,The rate of crime committed by teenagers is increasing throughout the world Discuss the possible reasons and give suggestions on how to solve the problem.,"The percentage of crime taken up by teenagers is remarked rising all over the world. Here is an essay aiming to illustrate the problems and find the solution. Ċ It is caused by many reasons both about individuals and societies. Because the teenagers always want to prove their abilities or value, the young man easily do some illegal things when they lose their mind, which leads to people prefer fighting against others rather than staying in harmony with others. In addition, the lack of public attention for them is a reason, for example, the knowledge about teaching teenagers how to control themselves is not enough whatever school and family supports, which causes teenagers to choose a crime way when they are distinguished by the world. Ċ But the public can solve the problems from original to the final by some methods. First and foremost tolerance treat the teenager who is first making a fault or crime, then help them correct the fault, because the second criminal heavily affects the growing rate of crime. What is more, the government should adjust the laws about teenagers, such as different punishments between teenagers and adults, and establishing some schools in jail. Last but not least if the crime is committed, teenagers can get forgiveness from the victim who was hurt by them, also helping the teenager change themselves. Ċ In summary, families, schools, and social communities, no one can forget the responsibility for teenagers' crime. It is better to cooperate helping teenagers grow into a person who can lead to a brighter future."
10023,obligations to paying taxes Some people think that they should be able to keep the money they earn and do not have to pay tax. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Opinions differ as to whether residents should have the right to save their hard-earned salary and should not have an obligation in paying taxes. Personally, I strongly opposed to this statement. Ċ To start with, it's common knowledge that tax revenue is utilised to pay for the public services and facilities infrastructure such as road infrastructure or public transportation. Furthermore, there is a strong connection between tax and old age pension, unemployment benefit and other financial aids. In addition, the emergency agents are funded by state taxes. For those reasons above, I am of the opinion that each individual should have the responsibility to pay the share money to support the government. Ċ Another point to consider is the fact that the residents can reap a great number of benefits not only for each one but also for the whole society. First and foremost, tax revenue is used to spend on social welfare, which will be funded to offer access to education for children from low-income families. Therefore, this will eventually eliminate illiteracy and might shake off poverty. One more benefit is that tax is allocated to fund for the social security network. As a result, the society will be kept safe from social ills. Ċ Opponents of the above statement might argue that the amount of money, which they have kept owing to their refusal to pay tax, can become their retirement savings and they do not need the government's pension. This might be a reasonable claim on the surface, but with a great number of demerits of social issues, some need to reconsider. Ċ To summarise, I am firmly of the opinion that each resident should contribute to the social by paying tax."
10024,"In order to reduce crime, we need to attack the causes of crime such as poverty and lack of educational opportunities. It is not enough to simply have more police on the street and put more people into prison. To what extent do you agree with this opinion?","More and more people decide to take the evil path and steal or commit murders in order to feed their family. Written in the daily newspaper or presented on the TV news, these cruel acts have more complex reasons. I believe that the causes of crime should be attacked instead of putting people into prison. 55 Ċ To begin with, people are able to do whatever it takes when their own survival is threatened. This can be seen in slums, where the quality of life is extremely low: people live in poverty and food is usually a delicacy. To deal with their lack of money and food, people are pushed towards smuggling and shoplifting. For example, in London there are many beggars who, besides asking for people's mercy, also use tricky means to empty their pockets. Shoplifters also use shotguns to intimidate the stuff and murders are committed if things go wrong.94 Ċ Other arguments in favor of dealing with the causes of crime are the job opportunities that one gains after he graduates from school. Nowadays, if a teenager has no skills or knowledge, he does not meet the requirements for a job. Youngsters that do not have access to education are limited and are determined to earn their money using illegal means. This brings us back to smuggling and shoplifting. 69 Ċ All these being considered, dealing with the causes of crime would lower the crime rate and would also improve the individual's life. I believe that once the number of people living in poverty decreases, the number of crimes will also go down.42"
10025,"Some people think that all the lawbreakers should be taken into the prison, while others believe that there are better alternatives, (for example, doing some work or learning some skills in the community). Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is true that the penitentiary system proved to be not perfect with its current ways of treating the criminals. In addition, the outcomes of their treatment in prisons are often regrettable and to not match the expectations of the society. In my opinion, alternative ways in dealing with the lawbreakers are much better than a conventional institution. Ċ Firstly, the common prisons are not concerned with the results of their influence on the criminals. While they utilize all the possible measures to restrain and punish their patients, they undermine a likelihood for these people to remedy themselves. Moreover, those sorrowful humans become more criminalized after leaving the prisons than before. Although, they are made to perform some jobs inside the prisons, any possible positive outcomes associated with this work are effectively undermined by the punitive attitude to them. For instance, the majority of the criminal activity at present is accounted for the people who had already been to the prisons. Ċ Secondly, it is widely argued that a better treatment of lawbreakers may convert them to the better people. Even though they committed crimes, these humans still have the right to rehabilitate themselves. Furthermore, after having left prison, they should return to normal social life without putting an additional burden on its lawful members. Having learned some skills in the normal community and without any pressure from the penitentiary system, they are less likely to return to the criminal path. For example, recent research has shown that learning news profession in prison prevents criminals from continuing doing crimes again. Ċ In conclusion, there are many problems perceived in connection to the habitual treatment of the lawbreakers in the modern society. Provided that the criminals pay their price by being convicted for the crimes made, alternative ways in treating them allow the society to diminish the criminal activities in the future."
10026,"Some people feel that it is always wrong to keep animals in captivity, for instance in zoos. Other people say that there are benefits for the animals and for humans. Discuss both sides of this debate, and give your personal view","Certain individuals think that it is cruel to keep non-human species in confined spaces like a zoo whereas the other outlook points to the advantages for both human and non-human species. I tend to conform to the second view but both will be discussed in this essay. Ċ First and foremost, when animals are caged they are denied their right to wander and do as they please, just as they would do in the forest. They have rights too and this has been the main debate forwarded by many anthropologists and human rights groups in the world. For example, one zoo had to be shut down in Norway as environmental apologists argued that such places were going against the natural ecosystem rules regarding flora and fauna. Ċ On the other hand, however, there are benefits for both people and other animals when the latter are housed somewhere. Firstly, people can get to enjoy the scenery of nature whereas the animal species will no longer have to search for food or worry about their safety in the jungle. Many cannot get enough of the sight of snakes nor want to skip lunch sessions when lions are being fed. It is food for their eyes. Furthermore, animals are given food, medical attention and protection in these facilities and this even prevents their extinction. For instance, in my perspective, had the Pangolins been 'captured and confined' in the eighties, Zimbabwe would still be a tourist hub of Southern Africa today. Ċ In conclusion, therefore, I argue that despite rights-based narratives, the pros that can be singled out from domesticating wild beasts are far more important than the cons. This position has been explained further in the essay above."
10027,"In the past, when students did a university degree, they trended to study in their own country. Ċ Nowadays, they have more opportunity to study abroad. Ċ What are the advantages and disadvantages of this development? Ċ You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.","Prior to the year 2000, it was more than normal for many of the students to continue with their post-college studies in their homeland. However, this has completely changed with globalization. Let me explain my thoughts in the next few paragraphs. Ċ To start with, management of different academies from various countries started organising educational fairs across the globe to attract students and talent. For me, this is the most important factor which started influencing graduates to explore their study chances at overseas universities. Campus facilities including advanced infrastructure, work while pursuing courses, economical advancements compared to their homeland, I think are the few advantages offered by overseas universities compared to local. For example, one of my friends opted to pursue his post-graduate degree from the University of Illinois. He weighed in the benefits of the course including global platform, job opportunities post completion of the course. Ċ On the other hand, we need to note that travelling overseas and pursuing education is not easy for many owing to financial and family dependencies. For example, I always wanted to go abroad and earn a degree in business management from the University of London which is known for its fame and placements. Also, if every student plans to complete his education overseas then it can add a huge gap to the local nation on not making enough talent for the future. For example, today Indian government is requesting non-resident Indians who are settled overseas to come back and serve the nation. This is a perfect case of pupils who migrated from India to other nations are now being asked to return to their mother nation and serve. Ċ To conclude, I recommend that one should balance their career by exploring both local and global opportunities and serve homeland once you are an expert at your subject."
10028,"birth rate in developed countries have been decreasing Many people today, especially in the developed world, are choosing to have fewer children, or none at all. Why is this happening, and do you think it is a good trend?","Recently, there are more and more people in developed countries deciding not to have as many kids as before. However, I think this is not a good sign. In the following essay, I will explain the reason for this and present my own opinion. Ċ One of the cause may be birth control policy imposed several decades ago. At that time, there were too many new born babies, so the government call for family planning. This concept has been deeply rooted in many people's heart since then. Second, as the social values change over time, more and more young couples disagree with the idea that they are obligated to sacrifice their youth or freedom so as to bear and raise children. Instead, they have their own dream or goal to pursue. Ċ In my opinion, economically, having less children born means that there will be fewer workers in the future, which may cause a dramatic decrease in a nation's productivity and economy growth. Moreover, I personally think that though having a child or more than one is a heavy burden and can be exhausting, it is definitely worthwhile and a strong sense of accomplishment to see your own children growing up and enjoy the laughter during the process. Ċ In conclusion, because of some policy carried out years ago and the change in people's thinking, birth rate in developed countries have been decreasing, which may lead to some negative effects. Therefore, both the governments and the people should come up with some methods to solve this problem."
10029,People are less fit and active nowadays than in the past. What are the reasons for this? What measures can be taken to fix this? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relavent examples from your own knowledge and experience,"These days, physical fitness among all human beings is one of the major concerns. In this essay, I will discuss some reasons and their solutions for this issue. Firstly, I will discuss how a busy lifestyle affects the activeness of a person and secondly, I will explore how technology makes an impact on this, and solutions for these problems. Ċ It seems clear to me that hectic lifestyle is the main reason for this. Because, in today’s era, due to busy and irregular schedule one doesn’t get sufficient time to exercise and maintain a healthy body. For instance, a person working in the information technology sector is more prone to body joint problem. However, this problem can be resolved by offering mandatory yoga or exercise session at the office. As a result, this will improve efficiency of the workforce in the form of less absenteeism of employee due to illness. Ċ Another point is that, the most of the people are addicted to late night use of their phone and laptop, which causes a reduction in effective hours of sleep, as we are in a technology driven world. This is because of people spending most of their time on social media platforms and entertainment applications. For example, research study showed that the younger generation is spending almost 25% of their time on Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and twitter. Therefore, a possible solution to this is a self-motivation, which can be in the form of proper parenting, the atmosphere of the house and social life. Ċ In conclusion, various factors affect the way of living life, which results in laziness or activeness. Also, there are plethora methods to overcome these problems."
10030,Some people believe that children should be allowed to choose what subjects they study at school. Others argue that everyone should study the same subjects. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.,"The argument about what subjects school children can study has both sides. Some opiate that there should be a choice while others argue that there should not be. In my opinion, the choice of what courses to major in can be chosen at a certain level. Ċ People have the view that all classes should be taken by students with their reasons being that none is irrelevant. They argue that all have relevance in grooming the children, irrespective, of the career path to be chosen. However, I only agree with this point on the basis that this is only important in the early days of a child's educational life. For example, it is of the essence that mathematics is taught as it is a needed requisite in our daily life. Ċ On the other hand, some say ''No, this should not be the case''. That there should be freedom and flexibility to what is being taught. They make this debate with their points anchored that everyone have the liberty to decide on what they would like to be in the future. As such, what should be learnt should be tailored to individual preferences. Admittedly, this is right, nevertheless, this decision should only be made when a senior class is attained prior to college. The selected majors are based according to the intended profession in order to acquire the underlining knowledge required. For instance, in Nigeria, on the attainment of senior secondary class 2, the student is allowed to pick from the range of schoolwork he or she has been exposed to according to what suits them best. Ċ In conclusion, the selection of what should be learnt can only come after being taught a range of subjects. Therefore, I reiterate my points that all that is taught in the education curriculum is important, nonetheless, a child can be selective when a senior class in high school is attained depending on the professional desire."
10031,More and more people are becoming serious overweight. Some people think that a solution can be to increase the price of fattening food. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"People hold different views about weight control. While a number of people believe that the most effective approach is raising the fare of fast meal. I, however, would argue that is is not a definite answer to this issue. Ċ On the one hand, there are compelling reasons for those who bear a thought that raising ready-made food fee can mitigate the weight-related problem. This is because the processed food fare has an inversely proportion to the load of consumption of such meal. For instance, many reports indicated that when the fare of fattening meal increases, the load of high-calories meal consumption would alleviate. Therefore, the number of population who contract obesity could be reduced now that It is the fat and cholesterol content in the fast meal which are the root cause of overweight. Ċ On the other hand, I believe that exercising regularly to burn the fat is also the viable measure to cope with this problem. Due to the fact that the lack of physical activities which is a part of sedentary lifestyle, is considered as a culprit of overweight. Not to mention that following healthy and balance diet with more the volume of fresh plant-based ingredients which lower the great load of fat and cholesterol in daily meal, can mitigate the number of obese people. For example, studies have found that those who following vegetarian diets are normally in much better well-built body than people prefer the meat-based meal. Ċ In conclusion, It seems to me that obesity problem generates from many origins and there are some feasible solutions to deal with it."
10032,"Some people think that drug addicts should be jailed, while others claim that they should be rehabilitated. Discuss both views and give your opinions.","A huge number of narcotic users are the hottest issue in the world. Some would argue that addicted people to drugs should be sentenced in prison to make them consider doing inappropriate actions, while others say that they need a treatment in health care to cure their suffering. While both views affect them positively, I believe that the latter notion is the effective way to make them getting better. Ċ The general view has stated that drug users should be arrested. By doing so, it will make addicted users becoming aware. The Jakarta Post news reported in March 2015 that the government in Indonesia has created the policy related to putting drug users into the jail. Nevertheless, 50% of addicted people completely stopped using narcotics, while the rest decided to reuse drugs again after being freed from prison in the following year. However this is not the best way since this policy does not make all of them wary. Ċ Apart from the previous discussion, I believe that putting them in rehabilitation is a better way to make drug addicts conscious. Narcotic users should be rehabilitated to set their mindset psychologically. For  example, In London, a survey carried out by Keil Rom in 2014 found that 85% of drug users perceiving rehabilitation program totally recover from narcotics. Such program not only get rid of narcotics from users, but also they are given a positive doctrine. This results in they not using drugs again and  becoming  more useful people in community. Ċ In conclusion, although sentence addicts in house arrest can reduce the number of addicts, it does not mean that they will not do the same action in the following days. I think that taking care them in hospital should be taken into consideration."
10033,Some international companies are very powerful now and many people believe that it is a negative development. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your reasons and relevant examples.,"Nowadays, some transnational companies are turning into megacorporations. A segment of society is convinced that this is an adverse development. I disagree with this opinion. Although powerful companies pose a threat to local businesses, I personally believe that their advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The following paragraphs will highlight my opinion along with relevant examples. Ċ To commence with, transnational market players offer a better service and a bigger range of products. Megacorporations highly value their reputation because it plays a crucial role in boosting their sales. As a result, marketers and managers focus on providing high-quality services by periodically training their personnel and conducting quality control procedures. Moreover, as they already have contracts with overseas suppliers, they can make some goods available worldwide. Take, for example, Carrefour. It was difficult for me to find certain products before Carrefour was opened in Tashkent in 2021. I had to order some brand products online and wait months for my paid delivery. However, now everything is available and affordable. Ċ Adding further, international corporations create more prestigious workplaces with higher salaries compared to local ones. This is beneficial for both, the economy of the country and its residents. The economy rises because local employees getting higher wages can spend more on buying goods and services from other companies. For instance, in underdeveloped countries, transnational organizations offer on average two or three times higher paycheck, which in turn improves local people's standard of life. Ċ To conclude, I believe that powerful companies offer more opportunities to people and the economy. They make new products and services available and create job places."
10034,"In some countries, the number of people who are using bicycles as their main form of transport is decreasing, even though cycling has too many benefits.  Why is this? What can be done to encourage people to use bicycles as their main form of transport?","It is a fact that riding bicycle is good for our health and it is an environment-friendly mode of transportation, but the number of user still decrease. Ċ Discouraging number of people use bicycle caused by the variety of transportation. For instance, cars able to transport a number of people rather than only one as well as bulky time. Faster, comfort, and the facility of car, can make employee enjoy their time, when they want to work. This situation gives rise fewer person to use faster transportation than bicycle. Ċ In addition, car can more effort more than single at the time, and the elderly or those that need to converse their energy for they work. Ċ On the other hand, encouraging more people to cycle will reduce pressure on their car-parking facilities and, as cycling may be faster in rush hour traffic, get more workers to sit, on time more often. There are several ways to invite citizens using bicycle than other transportation for working, such as, provide safe cycle training, ensure they have security facilities, raise awareness of benefits of cycling, supply bike-way in huge to make them easy to across the way, and provide maps of cycling routes with journey times. These ways and benefits might be changing people way to use bicycle. Ċ To conclude, bicycle more beneficial inside to work than car do it, with providing facilities. Hopefully, it can increase the user of bicycle as a main transportation for working. It can be clear to see the benefits for cycling more than car, also the drawback is less than car."
10035,"Topic: Friendships are an integral part of a person's life. Unfortunately, some of these relationships do not last. Write an essay highlighting some of the reasons that friendships sometimes die.","Friendships have been an indispensable part in our lives. We work with, play with and even learn from our friends. However, maintaining a friendship is not an easy task and sometimes friendships cannot last very long. There are several reasons to such cases, which includes mismatch personality and money-related conflict. Ċ First and foremost, matched personalities often decide the strength of friendship through time. Friends who have such contrast characteristics can hardly find their hobbies in common and usually run out of topic to talk about. For example, a cheerleader can hardly stand sitting all day in a room with a computer enthusiast. Furthermore, matched personalities bring about understanding and tolerance. Of course, friends with different personal traits can also understand each other but it takes them a long time to get to know each other well. Friends with similar characteristics are able to get on well much sooner as they tend to tolerate their friends behavior more right from the start. Ċ In addition, financial conflicts are able to cause fragile in a friendship easily. It is common that friends help each other through difficult periods so sometimes one needs to borrow money from their mates. If the debt is overdue or unpaid, the borrower loses credit. And if the situation prolongs multiple times, the lender completely lose their trust. It is suggested that friends keep their friendship out of the pitfall of financially debt in order to remain reliability. Ċ In conclusion, mismatch personalities and financial problem are two of the reason cause friendship to break. Whichever the reason is, one should keep a genuinely heart and honesty, which can be the key to any fracture."
10036,"These days, too many people maintain their health by relying on doctors and medicine, rather than by following a healthy lifestyles.  To what extent do you agree with this statement? medical care protection","Nowadays, it is claimed that there are more and more people rather depend on medical care than look after themselves. I am totally agree with this point of view. As a student myself, I find that there are too many homeworks that I am lack of leisure time for another activities. Ċ The first reason is that people these days in shortage of time to take care of their health. Take the children in Vietnam as an example, they have to go to school every weekdays, from 7am to 5pm, some even have extra classes, and then at night they have to stay up late to prepare lessons for the next morning. Therefore, they do not tend to have enough time take part in some outdoor exercise, especially high school students. Not to mention the pressure of continuously examination, schoolworks and assignments. Ċ Another reason that people are dependent on doctor is that they seem to be indifferent to their own lives than ever before. There is an critical increase in the number of ""workoholics"" in the last few years. Morever, there are many cases that people have to go to the hospital just because they are over-working or having eaten too much junk food. In the same thing, it is common in Vietnam to see that teenagers or even adults spend hours playing computer games. Ċ In conclusion, the way people living these days are really concerned and this may become a crisis in some developing countries, where are in shortage of man to help the nation. The authority should take steps to improve the qualities of the people lifestyles."
10037,"Nowadays, there is an ever increasing amount of noise in our everyday lives. What are the reasons and what can we do about it?","Our present-day metropolises are no longer quiet as they used to be. The issue that there is an increasing amount of noise in our lives has drawn a widespread attention. I believe that several factors contribute to this phenomenon and some measures can be taken to deal with it. Ċ To begin with, the majority of noises are given rise to modern technologies. Since our modern society is based on continuous production, plants and heavy machines in the factories are twenty-four seven functioning. Engines as one of the greatest noise producers are being used in everywhere. Beside, sharp noises coming from construction areas, horning form cars and the huge echo from aircrafts have totally breakthrough the silence of modern human society. Ċ Secondly, growing population can be another factor that makes the city roaring. The greater number of people, the more human activities can be made which lead to noises. It is common to hear people yelling, shouting, celebrating or even fighting in the midnights, which seriously disturb others' lives. Ċ Therefore, I believe that this problem can be relieved through the following measures. Firstly, if technologies create noises, human can also use it to reduce noises. For example, we can try to use more skills to prevent noises from creating when producing. Also, sound-proofing material can be used in the construction. Walls with special material can absorb more noises, thicker windows can prevent the sound from spreading. More importantly, everyone should increase their public awareness by controlling their behaviors and try not to disturb public environment. Ċ In conclusion, although noise is a serious problem in the society, I convince that it can be controlled effectively through everyone's effort."
10038,an increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues  do you agree with this? give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian,"Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect. Ċ Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources. Ċ Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific [i'm not sure what is the best adj to use T^T]; however, i am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind. Ċ To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended."
10039,"When international media (including movies, fashion shows, advertisements and other TV programs) convey the same messages to the global audience, people argue that the expansion of international media has negative impacts on cultural diversity. Ċ   Ċ What is your opinion?","Same programs have been broadcasted or shown in different media throughout the world. It is often debated that limitless encroachment of global media has demolished the unique tradition and perception of society. As far as I am concerned, I entirely disagree with the statement and I believe that it creates an opportunity to learn about other country and civilizations. Ċ To begin with, each community has its own tradition, norms, and customs to follow within the civilization that can be significantly diluted by the aggression of global media. To elaborate, since communities have their identical rules and procedures to live in society, people of the community, influenced by foreign media, could mix up their own culture with the overseas cultures. For instance, drinking alcohol is prohibited according to the law of Bangladeshi society. However, it is permitted in other countries. For this reason, citizens of Bangladesh may incline to use alcoholic drinks without considering Bangladeshi traditions and customs. Ċ On the other hand, people can watch the contents of the international media right at their home that can enable them to learn and acquire knowledge of other cultures. In other words, as TV programs, movies, and shows of other regions can teach about the culture and heritage of other states, an individual can learn many unknown facts about other countries and their people. For example, a Bangladeshi is now able to know the culture of an Indonesian village due to the widespread use of satellite and the internet. Therefore, people can acquire knowledge about other cultures and traditions from global media. Ċ In conclusion, it is an arguable issue whether global media have negative influences on civilization."
10040,Topic: Many people choose to study at university in another country.What kind of problems do you think they would encounter and what are the positive aspects of a decision like this??,"Nowadays, Many students are interested to study abroad. Studying in foreign countries is not easy and is quite expensive . Aside of being costly, studies in other countries has its benefits as well as drawbacks of its own kind.By analyzing the problems faced by students in foreign universities will show this. Ċ First of all, Many of the young people who study in another countries will face the problem of language barrier because there would be always a difference between native and nonnative speakers. As a result, it sometimes may lead to alienation of residential students from nonresidential students. This in turn will make the students feel that they are a threat to each other.For example, recently there were news frequently in a news channel that there were clashes occurring between Indian and Australian students more often in Australia. Ċ Secondly, there will be cultural differences among students who hail from various countries and backgrounds. Thus, students who hail from same country with similar backgrounds try to form as a group. This will further worsen the healthy environment in a class and would tend to create a rift among students. As a result, the main qualities of students such as unity,friendliness and cooperative to each other will completely dissolve in their meaning.However, Being educated in abroad will provide a chance to youth to explore multiple cultures and learn different customs followed by foreigners and spread the importance of their own culture. Ċ To conclude, though students may have to face few concerns related to language and cultures, they certainly get benefits from studying abroad.I strongly believe that, one can have international standards of education facilities, which is the main purpose of students for going abroad."
10041,Games are as important for children as they are for adults. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Some believes that playing a game is completely waste of time or at least it is fine for spending spare time. However, from my point of view, sometimes some games are really helpful for individuals. I will bring my reasons in two main areas. Ċ To begin with, all scientists and experts say that all people from young to the old should exercise. It is acknowledged that because of busy life there are some people who do not have enough time or do not have mood to exercise. Therefore, some type of exciting games can encourage them to do exercise, and enjoy too. Ċ Moreover, nowadays many individuals involve in different kind of problems, and sometimes these problems make them tired. Also, sometimes their mind is too busy and involved that they cannot find any path to solve their problems. Nonetheless, playing a game might put their mind at ease so they can forget their problems at least for moments. Interestingly, it happened to some people that during this time or after that a solution ignites in their mind. Ċ All in all, I would maintain that in todays' world, games are as important for children as they are for adults and the old. With the help of some games, people can do exercise which is helpful for their health and with playing some games they might release their mind from problems for a few moments."
10042,"communication between employees in different levels of the hierarchy in a company. In most successful companies, some people think that communication between employers and workers is the most important factor. Other people say that other factors are more important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","These days, it is believed that communication between the high and low hierarchical levels is of the most paramount importance factor of corporations' success. However, some argue that there are other contributing factors that determine the success of corporations. This essay will shed light on both points of view and present my own position. Ċ Undoubtedly effective communication plays a crucial role in companies. In fact, frequent communication fosters strong relationships with the staff and the managers, thereby comprehending each other. Additionally, or maybe as a result, this can enhance employee motivation since they may be satisfied with their work. Nevertheless, when a decision is made by managers, if the workers misinterpret this decision, the consequences of faulty products or lower productivity could be occurring. Therefore, successful communication can not only reduce pressure at work but also boost productivity, which is one of the most necessary factors that contribute to companies thrive. Ċ However, there are other factors are significant in order to build a company's success, some of which include recruiting the best people and developing effective strategies. Firstly, when companies require and retain great employees, this may give them a competitive edge over their competitors. Another critical criterion of a successful company is that long-term strategies are well-devised by the manager. This may enable the company to develop since these strategic plannings make organizational goals and objectively real. Thus, this empowers both the managers and employees to generate their necessary motivation to achieve the sole aim; hence, this promotes the growth of the company. Ċ In conclusion, communication between different levels of the hierarchy in a company is an important element that may lead to the company's success. Nevertheless, there are more significant factors for an organization to thrive in today's market, including staff recruitment and planning a viable strategy."
10043,Some people think that importing movies and TV programmes from other countries is better for country . Others think that it is better to produce these locally. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is believed that TV programmes and movies produced in other countries are better for the nation. I completely agree with the given statement. I believe it is beneficial for the economy in many ways. Ċ First of all, when we watch the movies or series of another nation, we get to know about their culture. Most of the movies are inspired by the locally followed lifestyle. It increases our knowledge of those regions where scripts are written and directed. Secondly, the local producers start using the latest technology to mark their own performance in their country. For example, recently, a movie was produced in India in which the latest VFX technology was used. This technology was brought from Hollywood, where it is used in the production of all the action movies. Finally, the actors in the home country learn the advanced skills of acting from imported films and TV shows. Ċ Moreover, the audience gets a variety of content to watch. There are many Hollywood series which are famous worldwide. However, if we talk about the locally produced content, many people get bored easily because of the similar content shown and already known facts about the local communities. For instance, I have many friends who love to watch foreign contents online where they get knowledge about new subjects. Eventually, it does not bring boredom and is fun to watch. Ċ To conclude, I would say that movies and TV shows of foreign nations do not have any negative effects on the local industry, rather it brings motivation among the local actors and helps them to improve for better."
10044,"Nowadays e-books have become widely spread. Some people claim that e-books are bound to oust conventional ones, while others believe that traditional printed books will never be a thing of the past. Discuss both views and express your opinion.","The technological advancement has created an impeccable impact on electronic content people produce and consume, particularly, in the era of cyberspace, e-books are gaining popularity. However, some people believe that with the evolution of e-books, traditional paper books have lost their importance. While others deem that digital books cannot replace reading printed books. In my opinion, I believe that both reading means will continue to be used in the future, depending on what they are used for. Ċ On the one hand, people prefer using e-books due to its convenience compared to conventional counterparts. E-books are promptly obtainable via one's smartphone or tablet, thus making e-books easier to access and bring no matter where people are. In other words, a smart tablet such as an iPad can easily fit in a handbag in lieu of carrying a big heavy book, which can be a nuisance to some people. Moreover, e-books are retrievable online, which eliminates the intention of going to bookstores to purchase books. For instance, when a student urgently needs reading materials for the coursework, he can easily use his smart devices with an Internet connection to access and obtain necessary chapters of a certain book, which would help him save much time. Ċ On the other hand, printed books cannot be supplanted by virtue of some inherent advantages they possess. First, people can get some different experiences from reading physical books versus e-books. For example, pages of written books might have a distinct, authentic smell that some avid readers prefer, thereby making them more inclined to purchasing and reading printed ones. Besides, there are millions of books available in the market, and some of the ancient writings cannot be translated into digital forms. Hence, e-books can not provide the same impact as physical books to the bookworms, though they are quite vivid and colourful. Ċ In conclusion, I personally think that both traditional books and digital books have their own readers, and the choice of using them would depend on the intended use. As the younger generation is likely to access to top-notch technology, youngsters tend to choose the digital version of books. Even though e-books have a thriving future, conventional paper books will never vanish completely."
10045,"question: Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions. Ċ To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains. Ċ Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive. Ċ By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished."
10046,"In the past, the role of a teacher was to provide information. Today, students have access to a lot of information. There is, therefore, no role for teacher in modern education. Ċ Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays due to advent of technology like: the internet, people believe that their children have an access to everything they need to study,as per which they do not need any teacher, however, I partially differ in this statement. This essay shall present both the sides along with relevant examples. Ċ To begin with the positives of having an instructor are: firstly, better clarification of doubts could be done in physical presence of both the guru and the disciple. This is because it provide an environment to imbibe and learn better as students are accompanied with their class mates. In contrast, if teachers would not have been there, then this might take a long for pupils to solve their book-related problems. For instance, when going to the school, it is absolutely clear in a learner's mind that they are going there to learn. Hence their brains would function accordingly, and could perform better. Secondly, they do not only help in studies but also assist in developing new etiquettes. This is because they observe the habits inculcated in the kids and try to shape them in a more beautiful pattern. For example, I developed the deed of sharing meal with my friends after my teacher instructed whole of the class to ask each other to have-a-bit before starting to eat. Ċ On the other hand,today everything has become virtual. The reason being the technology. The parents as well as their cherub think visiting institutions as a waste of time and money. They say if teachers are available online what is the need to go to the school. As this could give some-more hours of sleep to their sprouts, such as, I uaually woke up at 5 am during my school-days as we stayed far from the building. Moving further, online doubts could be cleared anytime with no boundations of the day or night, while physically the tutor could not be available for this long. To exemplify,study hours in the schools are 8 am to 2 pm, after which the younglings have to focus on their own, in case of a doubt they often surf on internet rather asking their teachers. Ċ In conclusion,it is clear in the ambience of a teacher students learn more dedicatidly and develpe good etiquettes, while in their absence they use internet to rectify doubts and mistakes. But ,I ponder that despite of the advantages of each section, an adequate study without a tutor is not worthit."
10047,Many today feel that most urgent problems can only be solved by international cooperation. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree,"In today's globalized world, we are facing many major issues, which are not yet solved. It is often believed by a few sections of society that all countries should work together to find a solution to these problems. I completely agree with this view, and the following essay will decipher the various reasons for my standpoint. Ċ The most primary concern everyone facing is Pollution and global warming, which can be solved by international collaboration. Instead of facing environmental issues individually, if all countries gather together and share their advanced technology, there is a possibility to get a permanent answer for this global concern. For example, with the invention of the electric car Tesla, many car companies are using that technique over fuel cars, which eventually decreasing air pollution. Clearly, if technologies get exchanged, we can tackle pollution problems. Ċ The second concern in front of the world is rising health problems, for which wealthier countries should support poor ones. Developing nations and those under the poverty line cannot provide all advanced medical facilities to its citizens, which adversely affects their lives. However, underdeveloped countries can get all necessary medical support and can curb their health problems by international assistance. For instance, during COVID-19 pandemic, India has provided masks and medical equipment to many countries at a free of cost. Therefore, such an international understanding is essential nowadays. Ċ In conclusion, there is no doubt that the environment and health-related issues are rising enormously. As such, finding an effective solution is a number priority, for which all countries should cooperate globally with each other."
10048,Globalisation of trade can be said to confer advantages on third world countries on the one hand and increase the gaps between the haves and have-nots on the other.  Globalisation of trade is beneficial to the economicaly backward countries Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Due to advancement in technology globalisation has entered in each and every field. Even though it has brought many advantages for third world countries yet there are some disadvantages too that it increase gape between rich and poor countries. I believe that globalisation of trade is considerabely beneficial to third world countries. Ċ One of the benefit under developed countries have from globalisation of trade is that the standard of living of people has become high. people can enjoy variety of international markets in their own country. For instance, i-phone and Mc-donalds has brought people to live in a high standard. Socond thing is that globalisation has brought employment to third world countries. Many of people are employed in underdeveloped countries. At last, improvament in technology can clearly be seen here. It gave advanced machines such as health equipment and many more. Ċ Along with many advantages it has given disadvantage too to poor nations. Along with standard of living cost of living has also become high. the products sold in that nations are taxed more by that nations and then companies fill up by costing it highly. So indirectly all weight goes to the people of that country. Hence, only rich people can afford it not poor. Moreover, Although it gave employment yet the majority of profited amount goes to developed countries. This way the gap between poor countries and rich countries is increasing. Ċ All in all, I express my solidatory with the view that if poor countries and rich countries work hand in hand with not only concentrating on profit then it would be more beneficial for both developed and undeveloped countries."
10049,"Some people have the same type of job they do throughout their lifetime, while others prefer to change the type of job they do. Discuss both views and give your opinion","It is often thought by some people permanent activity is best for career progression, others think that with the help of temporary work most of the people can advance essential career experience in their life. In my opinion changing affair in different period gives a chance to increase our productivity. This essay will discuss both points of views. Ċ On the one hand, there are could be useful factors associated with staying in the same job, however, the main benefit is becoming part of a team. It means that if employees stay a same business they can improve their team skill such as working together, increasing competitive skills as well as leadership skills. Moreover, becoming a part of staff enable the personal profit financial promotions. For instance, in my country, the majority of officials, usually do not alter their struggle because of the risks of a new activity, in addition, their loyalty of a team. Thus, in such situations, the permanent work is pretty productive for the employees. Ċ On the other hand, due to globalization and modernization, most of the personality needs to be more flexible for their further career progression. This means that with the help of flexible affair the majority of workers can increase a range of experience and skills such as taking risks ability, deciding quickly skill. My uncle is a prime example, although he is an accountant he had worked at several jobs. Currently, he is working in an international company as a CEO. For this reason, such changing work allows workers to profit more profit than permanent activity. Ċ In conclusion, I completely believe that having been more flexible within our job we can increase a high level of experience and skill. Even if there are some merits such as becoming a part of staff, also the beneficial aspects of temporary activity outweigh the merits of a permanent job."
10050,Art is considered an important part of a society as well as an expression of its Ċ culture. Do you think it is important for children to be taught art? Do you think Ċ children should be encouraged to focus on art rather than other subjects?,"Arguably, art is regarded as a relevant asset of communities since it represents the non-verbal expression of the culture. Personally, I believe Boys and Girls should be trained in it. Albeit, I do not advocate concentrating them solely in it to the detriment of other subjects. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide anecdotal evidence to prove the arguments. Ċ On the one hand, art teaches youngsters to preserve the culture. In other words, making offspring know about art transmits the communities value to the next generation. For instance, the recent research carried out by UNESCO showcased the most efficient way to pass information from one generation to another was through earlier youngsters' instruction about the craft and wall paintings and other sorts of creativities. As a result, children were the guarantors of the continuation of the knowledge to the newcomers. Moreover, it is the overriding way to transmit acquaintance from one peer group to another. Ċ On the other hand,one subject focusing is detrimental to Boys and Girls. Because of the demand in global specialization, the heir should not regard artistry as the unique way to solve planet issues, other disciplines like maths, physics and Chemistry require attention. In Spain, where artistry is considered as its birth land, a quarter of the population invest in it to exemplify. However, a significant number of locals are well-succeeded. Hence, the overwhelming majority of them have led astray due to a shortfall of investment. Ċ In conclusion, indeed, artwork should be taught to children in earlier stages of their careers so that they disseminate as well as pass it to another age group. Therefore I regard it as pivotal to the children and it should be mixed with other relevant disciplines. In addition, I recommend the world-ruling power allocates art-related subjects in schools for youngsters' better understanding."
10051,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks. Ċ There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can't be always found in books. Ċ I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don't take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That's why it is important to take risks. Ċ In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them."
10052,"Some people believe that entertainers are paid too much and their impact on society is negative, while others disagree and believe that they deserve the money they make because of their positive effect on others. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.","A section of society often argued that entertainers such as movie actors and comedians earn huge money but public acquire negative habits from them. However certain masses believe that superstars deserve massive funds because they send a positive message among the general public. Personally, I support the former view. This essay will intend to analyze both aspects in detail with relevant examples. Ċ One the one hand, famous stars often do drink and smoke in public events. It has been observed that the public who follow them seriously, adapt these negative habits from them. As a result, their career and family life also do suffer due to this worse obsession. For example, the latest report by ""The Times of India"" reveals that 50% of the populace who do regular smoking and drinking admit that they develop these habits by copying their idle. Therefore, I believe that well-renowned personalities have a detrimental effect on society people. Ċ On the other hand, some eminent personalities regular do charity job for poverty-stricken people, which send a positive message in the community. Famous stars often support financially NGO or social groups who works for orphan children and senior citizens. As an outcome, for sake of copying their idles, the city dwellers automatically commence social service job. For instance, the recent survey by ""The Forbes"" magazine claims that on an average 40% of masses have started social work just to copy their role models. Hence, famous people should be paid heavily due to their significant work for the community. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that though eminent superstars do a tremendous social task, yet they develop a negative culture among masses. Therefore they should not be paid to much."
10053,Our personalities are predetermined as a result of our genes before we are born and there is nothing that can be done to change our character traits. Ċ To what extent do you agree?,"Research on personality development is a vast topic in the field of psychology. There is a view that nothing can alter our identity as it is determined by our genes before our birth. This essay elaborates, why I completely disagree with this view. Ċ To begin with, a man/woman's personality develops with experiences that he/she encounters. A small baby doesn't have much in terms of character, to start with. As he grows older, he faces numerous struggles, learns from them and develops his own responses which shape his personality. Even though the baby carries his genetic makeup since birth, it the surrounding struggles that ultimately shape his character traits. For example, identical twins carry the same set of genes, but are challenged with different scenarios in life, and thus end up having different personalities. Ċ Secondly, not only is personality development dependent on the situations that we face in the younger years, but it is also malleable. Though we choose to stay rigid about some of our traits, we can alter them according to the situation that we face. For instance, an introverted man who repeatedly fails at relationships might just become an obvious extrovert with practice and effort to succeed in his future relationships. Though our DNA is fixed since birth, even the most basic inherent qualities can be modified contradicting the argument that our genes determine our quirks and nothing can be done to transform them. Ċ Hence, in conclusion, I would completely disagree with the opinion that our personalities are predetermined and our character attributes are not amenable to alteration because our personalities are an outcome of our struggles (more than our nucleic acids) and the ability of a human being to change even the most basic of his traits (a quality not possessed by the genetic material)."
10054,"In some countries, governments provide payments for unemployed people. How does this impact people? Is this a positive or negative development?","It is true that unemployment citizens could receive benefits when they need them from the authorities in many nations. Although it will enable someone to go through the difficult times, I believe that it also has a negative impact on countries’ progress. Ċ The effect of unemployment payments is that struggling individuals and families are able to survive challenging periods. A good recent example of this would be the record unemployment rates in the wake of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic that millions of workers lost their jobs. To be more specific, many families can not afford their living expenses and without government , the support they might lose their homes or struggle to obtain everyday meals. As a result,the benefits allowed them to pull through a difficult period and use their time to look for a new job. Moreover, with a good amount of benefits, they can try to find a quality job rather than settling for the first position offered by a company trying to exploit the historic jobless rate to recruit workers with lower salaries. Ċ However, although providing benefits can help people sustain their lives, it has a largely negative development because it has wide-reaching effects on society. Firstly, helping the most difficult groups out of poverty may have a massive influence on the social workforce. It is likely that some people choose to claim benefits rather than working as they are no longer motivated to find a job. For example, some individuals found that the relief payments are even higher than their wages so they prefer to stay at home instead of going to apply for new employment . Furthermore, this will result in society not having enough labour to support its development because fewer people are willing to look for jobs again. Ċ In conclusion, unemployment benefits are a great boon for those without jobs in the short term, but I do believe that it will cause a shortage of social labourers and all citizens should be encouraged to work to earn a living and support themselves in the long term."
10055,"Now a days, in urban cities, a lot of people prefer living in large apartment blocks. Write an essay discussing the advantages and disadvantages of living in large apartment blocks. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge.","Living in skyscrapers is the most encouraging standard for this contemporary generation. Tier-2 & 3 city crowd prefer to stay in high-rise buildings to enjoy its positive outcomes. In this essay, I will discuss both merits and demerits and provide relevant examples to prove why benefits are more than drawbacks from my real-life understandings. Ċ High-rise towers have some issues which can be ignored in my opinion and also can be solved with proper planning. The primary one being, there is an increase in population density than expected because of many families living in a confined area. Beijing is a vertically planned city, for instance, has recorded a high pollution index due to a significant number of families living in a small geography. Adding to this, depletion of natural resources occurs due to heavy consumption which eventually leads to dissatisfaction among residents. The groundwater availability in a confined area, for example, will be sufficient for a limited number of people as per the research conducted by the renowned geological UK University. Ċ On the other hand, there are two important merits of these vertically constructed towers. A positive trend is observed in socialising and building relationships among gated apartment community people. A survey conducted by an Indian cultural artefacts institute, to illustrate, has revealed that families living in communities have recorded with high happiness index when compared with distributed colonies. Apart from this, the contribution towards environmental protection in the form of stopping deforestation because of these skyscrapers is an irrefutable benefit to mother nature. Australia has recorded the highest rainfall during the last three consecutive years, for example, because of its vast and distributed forest area. Ċ In conclusion, many citizens across the world are preferring to live in high-rise buildings because of their greater benefits. There are some drawbacks because of the apartment culture, however, the merits of this trend is having stupendous benefits to individuals and the environment altogether."
10056,Many processed foods and ready-made meals contain preservatives and additives . what are advantages to this? Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"In this busy world, more and more people would like to buy many cane food items. These products are preserved by additives and chemicals. However, I personally believe that this process has more pros than any minor cons. Ċ To begin with, there are some negatives that can be associated with these chemicals. One possible issue is the chance of provoking an allergic reaction, due to the ingredients of the additives. This reaction happens very rarely because most companies are regulated by the government authority, as a result, they strictly monitor these companies in order to provide safe foods. For example, these institutions are directly monitored by the food and safety department and those who break the rules and regulations have been punished. Consequently, the negative effects are minimum. Ċ Despite the above-mentioned disadvantages, I strongly consider the positive aspects of this process. Firstly, humans can store edibles for a long time since the ancestor period, thus, this has helped mankind not only to escape from famine but also saved many lives as well. For instance, presently, this method we use to make ready-made eatables, such as chapatis, bread and dosa are readily available, which is particularly helpful for working women with a lot of responsibilities. Hence, this trend has more benefits. Ċ To conclude, people are pessimistic about the chemical used to preserve bread. While there someAdd a missing verbare someIt seems that you are missing a verb. Consider adding it. Ċ show examples reactions that can be occurred from this, I consider this trend has more pros than cons. It is recommended that there should be more research on this for a better future."
10057,"The unlimited use of cars may cause many problems. What are those problems? In order to reduce the problems, should we discourage people to use cars?","Nowadays, many people have their own cars and frequently use it, which is clarified by its convenience and comfortable. Although, by driving cars, people has given rise to many serious consequences. In this essays, I intend to discuss both the serious impacts of using cars and possible solution to resolve this. Ċ It is undeniable fact that the unlimited use of cars is responsible for the range of problems that influence our lives negatively. Having driven in congestion of traffic waste many valuable time; it also lead to stressful and reduce our efficient quality in working or studying. Additionally, through the worlds, numerous cars using regularly have impacted negatively on our environment as the large amount of carbon dioxin emissions, which is responsible for detrimental to health and global warming. Furthermore, it is evident that car accidents over the past 50 years has seen a considerable increase in casualties. Ċ However, to address this issues of relevance, it is suggested that people should be restricted in driving cars. In my view, though, it is not a good option since this solution will effects noticeably in individual's schedule. Thus, the more relevant solution would be opening public campaigns to encourage people in reducing the use of cars by demonstrate a range of benefits in economic price and healthy life by using public transports and bicycle. Ċ To conclude, these problems are indeed incapable to address in the short term. Though, it is by no means insurmountable, and I believe that were people together attempt to reduce using vehicles, it would be significantly positive impacts on our life in latter time."
10058,Recent research has shown that within the European Union the largest difference between the earnings of men and women exists in the UK. Many equal rights campaigners believe that immediate action should be taken to close the gender pay gap. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?,"Gender inequality has been one of the most debated topics. Recent researchers have inferred that the difference between the earnings of men and women is huge in the UK. Eventually, equal rights activists believe that the government ought to propose a solution for this immediately. I agree that the gender pay gap should be eradicated as at work every employee is treated equally. Ċ To commence with, one of the prominent reasons behind making equal wages mandatory is that both men and women exercise the same job responsibilities irrespective of their gender. Hence, paying fewer wages to women as compared to men is an unjustifiable practice. Even though female employees outperform males they are still paid less. For instance, these days many managerial positions in MNCs in the UK are occupied by women and also get recognised for their good work. In such cases, paying them equal to men will encourage them to continue the same. Ċ Furthermore, women at work perform well compared to men. As a result, they have to be encouraged by giving them higher increments. For example, these days bigger companies like Microsoft prefer to hire women employees in order to promote gender equality and encourage them to work. It would promote equality if all are paid on the basis of the work they do rather than the gender. It is indeed an advantage to the companies if the top performer is encouraged. Ċ To conclude, salary, when paid based on the performance and the number of responsibilities undertaken will promote equality rather than paying based on gender, as there will always be low performers among men. Paying women less than men for the same set of responsibilities is an injustice and has to be stopped immediately."
10059,"Some people think that to reduce traffic and pollution, the government should increase tax on petrol (gasoline). Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","Nowadays, there is an increasing trend of mobilization within the society to fulfil their overall needs and this will lead to more congestions and bad air status. It is supposed by many that the regulators should impose more tax on fuel to offset that condition. I totally agree with the statement and this essay will discuss both sides of the argument. Ċ To begin with, there are some advantages in imposing more cess on petrol. Firstly, by doing so, there will be a change in the way people travel. A more expensive price of gasoline will make citizens think twice before deciding to drive their own private cars. For example, the data from the ministry of transportation stated that adding 5% more cess on these products will bring a significant drop in the overall usage of private vehicles. In addition to that, the community will also start to change to public systems to go everywhere. Thus, this program will cause a major drop in traffic and pollution. Ċ On the contrary, there is also a major drawback in implementing this program. By adding more fees to the fuel, it will also affect the other economic aspects, such as household. More folk will suffer from the increased expense of gasoline because it is also important in many businesses. For instance, a soaring fee of petrol will make many restaurants have difficulty in maintaining their previous food price due to the rising fees of production. Consequently, fewer citizens will be able to afford food. Ċ To conclude, increasing tax on gasoline will impact the reduction of congestion and bad air status. However, it will also make the life of people more difficult in many aspects. Although, based on the factors mentioned above, the advantages of the statement still outweigh the bad ones."
10060,Some people believe that living in big cities is becoming more difficult. Others believe that it is getting easier. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"In the present time, large towns become the predominant living places chosen by many people who chase their ambitions. While some people believe that being urban immigrant is becoming more challenging, others think the converse opinion. In my point of view, regardless living cost, dwelling in major city makes people get a better education easily. Ċ Living expenses is believed as worrying issue by some metropolitan people. Some people think that living cost is difficult to fulfil. Taking an article from times magazine for an example, living cost in some large cities such as London, Hamburg and California is skyrocketing in recent years, making people hard to afford their daily needs. This also leads to the increasing numbers of the homeless. As consequence, many people think that dwelling in big cities is hard. Ċ Although people have to spend much money dwelling in large town, I believe that the difficulties of living in urban area are encountered by some counter-arguments. There are plenty of education opportunities in major cities. Several prestigious tertiary educational institutions are centred in these urban area. Students will get their better education experiences in major cities. According to Professor Ivan, head of MIT department of urban studies and Planning, several big cities are designed to become education centre area in order to attract more students. Therefore, many people choose to live in large town due to its easiness to get proper education. Ċ In conclusion, even though settling in large cities will bring up several difficulties, I believe that the urban life difficulties will be far outweighed by the merits of living in urban area.

10061,What are the benefits of requiring young people to serve the army? Does participation in community work qualify as an alternative?,"Nowadays, there are an increasing number of countries require young adults to be trained in the army for at least one year, which has sparked off an intense debate among people. Some people claim that working in communities can replace serving the army.Personally, I disagree with this opinion. Ċ To begin with, this action exerts a positive impact on strengthening and improving the national defense system. Unarguably, every country in the global community is gravely threatened by a series of destabilizing factors such as terrorism, arms proliferation and so forth. Recruiting young individuals into the army can enable them to master the professional and systematic skills of armaments, which is conductive for countries to effectively and sufficiently prepare for those possible crisis and threats. Ċ In addition, this measure contributes to career developments of young individuals. It is simply because that simple and poor living conditions of the army can efficiently shape the characters of those who have already been accustomed with comfortable and cozy lifestyle and make them to become much tougher. Consequently, they are more likely to overcome various hindrances in their careers and to achieve their career successes than ordinary people Ċ Admittedly, young adults not only can gain a variety of practical and transferable skills but also can develop their communication techniques and cooperation abilities by means of undertaking community works. However, all the capabilities and knowledge which are acquired from the army cannot be obtained from community works. Thus, community works cannot serve as an alternative. Ċ To conclude, I concede that participating in community work possesses numerous unparalleled and compelling advantages.Nevertheless, I am still convinced that young adults and the entire society can become the major beneficiaries from this measure."
10062,"Some people think that women should have the same right as men to choose profession. Others, however, believe that women are less able than men to do certain jobs. Discuss both those views and give your own opinion.","People have discrepant views about women's right to choose profession. In my opinion, though men are more suitable than women in some jobs, it does not deprive women of their equal status in the job market. Ċ It is true that some professions tend to be more popular with one gender than the other. For instance, men are more likely to become software programmers and drivers, while women are more likely to become fashion models and nurses. This is due to their different characteristics. Men are better at logical thinking and physically stronger, while women do better in arts and delicate work. Although opportunities of education have been provided equally for both sexes in recent years, we cannot deny that males and females still appear to have different preferences when picking majors. Therefore, it is natural for some people to think that women are less able than men in some areas. Ċ However, accepting the difference between male and female is not the same as sex discrimination. I believe people should be recruited according to their ability and qualifications, and gender is unlikely to be included as a job requirement on most occasions. Furthermore, a considerable number of women have proved that they can also be excellent in men's traditional fields. Examples of female scientists and generals can often be found in history books. Therefore, we cannot deny women's right to be successful in certain fields in their own ways. Ċ In conclusion, it seems to me that profession should be chosen on the basis of gender equality, despite the fact that men and women are sometimes talented for different jobs."
10063,"18.	The range and quality of food that we can buy has changed because of technological and scientific advances. Some people regard this change as an improvement, while others believe that it is harmful. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","A variety of food products these days showcase an evolved change. Due to advancements in science and technology, the quality and range of food-related products have wider benefits. Some consider it harmful, while others see it as an improvement. In today's essay, I will be discussing my notes on both views and provide my opinion. Ċ Firstly, let's discuss the harmful effects. Most packed food items in recent times are frozen for which chemical formulations are used. Apart from this, many farmers tend to spray pesticides on fresh vegetables and fruits. Albeit, such solutions keep them fresh and long-lasting, it is not considered healthy for our human body. For example, Hydrochloric acid is used as a disinfectant but proved poisonous to mankind. There were reported cases of allergic reactions to the consumption of HCL used fruits. This indeed decreases the quality of the produce and ascends the harmful effects. The amount of humans diverting towards organic cultivation is an example of itself. Ċ Conversely, in ancient times, due to a lack of preservatives, most cultivated crops were rotten. Farmers faced severe damages affecting them psychologically and financially. With the recent advancements in science, the quantity of the harvest is improved, as well as with technological developments, the harvests can be stored for a much longer period of time. For instance, rats, snakes and earthworms eat the plants. Because of the chemicals and pesticides, we are able to control them from entering the fields. Also, frozen food products are most convenient to store and use. Ċ To conclude, there are two sides to a coin, so does this raising argument. It definitely has multiple views attached to it. Scientists are working towards eradicating those harmful implications. Therefore, In my opinion, it is a considerable development but does affect our health."
10064,More & more fathers are taking a break from their careers so that they can stay home and take care of their children while their wives work. This is better for the family than having both parents work full time. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion.,"Many fathers give up their profession in order to take care of their homes and families . Also, it might be good for their family rather than working both of them the whole day. It is true that a parent should stay at home to look after their children. This essay doesn't agree with the statement that fathers should give up his job. This essay will discuss why fathers should not give up his job & both parents should work to earn more income. Ċ Firstly, fathers giving up his race might be unhappy with his decision. He might miss his tough & challenging job which he has sacrificed for his children. Moreover, children are not usually at home as they are the whole day in school. Fathers might get boredom by doing household works. For instance, my cousin brother who left his career for his children & entire day waiting at home. In exchange, he does households works such as mopping floors, cooking & feeding to his children. Ċ In addition, fathers & mothers, both are working for their children to earn more salaries. In fact, if parents are working they have a better lifestyle than a single working parent. Furthermore, the situation is that both parents should work in this expensive world to have a desired lifestyle. The condition might be if a single parent is working, she is not earning enough money due which has an impact on living style. For example, according to the survey of Business Times in 2017, both the parents are working the whole day to have a standard of living as well as for children's future. Ċ To conclude, parents should have a career for the well-being of children career & family. Parents can spend togetherness with their kids during holidays or on a family trip or at evening."
10065,Nowadays air transport is used to export a wide variety of food to countries where the food is out of season. Some people think this is a positive development. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"People in many countries today can enjoy various kinds of food from other places of the world due to the advancement of transport, especially airplane. I agree with the view that this is a positive development. Ċ First, people's lives are greatly enriched owing to the increase in the variety of food. In the past people's dinner was restricted to the local seasons. Especially in cold districts, very few kinds of food were available in markets and people could only put food in storage by freezing or curing them. The nutrition and freshness were consequently reduced. With the help of air transport, fresh food can be delivered to any corner of the Earth, and people can eat the food out of season without worrying about the quality of the food. Ċ Furthermore, transport of food between countries is also a nice way to promote economic and cultural exchange. Food corporations, airline companies and governments can all make money through international trade, air fare and duties. For consumers, it is also a chance to learn about another culture, which may arouse their interests in travelling to the country where the food are produced. Ċ However, some people may argue that there are other alternatives to provide people with out-of-season food. For example, advancement in agriculture technology has made it possible to simulate the climates in other seasons in greenhouses so that many kinds of food do not exclusively belong to one particular season any more. But in my opinion, compared to the rapidity and convenience of air transport, more time and space are supposed to be consumed by this approach. Ċ In conclusion, people, companies and governments can all benefit from air transport of food, and this kind of business should be encouraged in a world-wide range."
10066,TASK2: An increasing number of people are choosing to watch international television shows and films. Less nationally produced entertainment is being made each year. What do you think is causing this trend and what are the potential effects for national identity? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experiences.,"Nowadays, the figure of people who enjoy watching international programs instead of national shows, which leads to less entertainment by film-maker annually. This essay is going to discuss this trend caused by many reasons and seriously affected national character. Ċ There are many obvious factors in terms of expanding knowledge and ensuring profit for entertainment companies. Firstly, the knowledge-implementing need about cultural foreign countries is necessary for revolution so people often pick up international channels to enjoy as well as study. For instance, if you watch BBC news, you can listen to many real and humorous stories and comprehend cultural behavior of different countries. More importantly, the producer predicted the needs of most people so they produced an outside-country program and limited funds for national ones to make more profit. When interests of people change, provider need to transmute old type into new type to caught in time tend age to exist in entertainment market. Ċ This trend influences considerably on national identity in many ways for different kinds of people. Firstly, it may be a positive sign for characters if people maintain cultural value when watching more international products. In other words, although they approach many different cultures, they still select and enhance valuable identity for friends in the world, which express patriotism, intelligence and creation of people. However, if people were over-interested in other countries, their national character would gradually fade and disappear. Ċ In my opinion, despite being only an entertainment type with a new trend that is quite suitable for circumstance today, it is formed from far-reaching reasons and affected deeply national identity. This trend can be taken into consideration as measure of character's judgement."
10067,Topic: Somes believe that individuals who have graduated from university deserve a higher salary than those who have not. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? better education should mean higher wages,"People have different views with regard to the opportunities earning better salaries between those who have a university certificate and who have not. while I argue that the bachelor certification would be more interested in high-level positions, I believe that the worker who did not attend any universities may deserve more income. Ċ There are various reasons why those who have graduated from the university may have the golden chances to find better salaries. Firstly, freshmen graduated from the university may certainly have a strong background. From a personal perspective, I believe that the many hours of sacrifice required to achieve a university degree shows that individuals have the abilities to maintain a focus for the duration of their studies. Secondly, the university may offer subjects that will be useful in the future careers. the students, for example, who major in electronic engineering would be taught in details about basic as well as expert subjects such as Integrated Circuit and Electromagnetics Engineering by the experts that the worker who did not attend university never have. Ċ In spite of these arguments, I believe that individuals are successful in completing a course of study at university does not necessarily mean they will be good at employees. In my opinion, it may be that employers begin to value the creative thinking skills above practice or technical skills. Furthermore, there are a lot of tasks in the university differencing from the tasks in the workplace. timing schedule and environment, for example, in the university are less strict and stressful than in the office. Ċ In conclusion, although the views of the workers who have a university degree should earn more money than who have not, we should not dismiss all those who did not attend university but superb at their job as irrelevant"
10068,"Some people think that high salary is important when choosing a company to work for, while others think that good working atmosphere is more important. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The dispute about the priority of the high monetary reward and the cosy environment of the job has been there for years. Some people claim that the pay should be the main consideration when searching for the jobs, while others argue that the significance of working mood is more than its treatment. The idea of both sides with my own opinion together will be further discussed and elaborated in this essay. Ċ To begin with, satisfying themselves with the desire of substances like the latest fashion or fancy cars has always been the primary reason for people who are looking for the higher wage. For instance, I am a nurse in the medical centre, Chang-Gung, which offers a better remuneration and benefits than other local hospitals. The earning enables me to support my family financially and afford the fees of travelling and learning language or the instrument. Consequently, with the high income that can ensure an individual to acquire better quality of living. Ċ On the contrary, working under the comfortable ambience that would enhance the enthusiasm and satisfaction of an employee. Besides that, the research has indicated that the working atmosphere is associated with one's productivity. By example, many technology companies such as Google or Apple allow their employees to wear comfy clothes as well as providing the entertainment room, with the 24 hours catering services in order to increase the creativity of the staff. Therefore, the good surrounding feeling in an office is not only helping to boost the morale among staff members, but also creates more profits for the firm. Ċ In conclusion, after analysing two sides of view, it is clear that both have its own advantages and the weight of them are equal. From my perspective, it depends on what is your priority and need. However, according to my personal experience and consideration, the salary would be the decisive factor when I am looking for jobs."
10069,Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"A certain number of the public believe that conducting international games programmes brings advantages for a nation.In my opinion,I strongly agreed with this statement and will discuss further details in the following paragraphs. Ċ First and foremost,these ceremonies give several positive waves for a nation since it increases the opportunities for job and several businesses.Moreover,this helps to raise economic growth tremendously.For instance,Qatar going to arrange all facilities for the common-wealth sports next year and they made some well-equipped stadiums and hotels to gather this moment and it has been increasing their financial capacity day by day.Secondly,the government gets high revenue through the taxes from such programmes while some investments are required initially for decorating items.In addition,it affects the stock market booming and many investors deposit huge amounts since they attracted on these enormous growths of the economic condition of that region. Ċ On the other hand,a number of social feels insecure about this topic because they may change their shops or markets for the expansion of new buildings at this time.For example,one of my friends who has been running a mobile shop near the extent of an apartment and the authorities gave notice to him to shift his office to another place,upon this issue he faced a lot of issue in terms of finding additional money for it.The government takes such responsibility since these programs assist them in terms of gaining a good economic situation. Ċ In conclusion,there are many pros and limited cons when this happens but I agree and support these advantages surpass the disadvantages."
10070,"As people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate","At first human made technology and nowadays technology dominate not only us but also our lives.There is no doubt that technology has had a huge impact: some of them have brought benefits for us and some of them have been adverse. Unfortunately today's people rarely can see the disadvantages of technology, and i imagine because of their busy life, they can not sense them. Ċ First of all, most of people have an individual cell phone. They do a lot of their work with it: people set their cell phone to remember them some something, for instance their dates, important days ( date of births ) , etc .Although these are positive points of technology people gradually become unable to member or remember the things even merely things . Ċ Secondly, it is acknowledged that a huge number of students use calculator to solve math problems. Though it helps to save their time, sometimes they can not answer a simple problem such as subtraction of two numbers.They have relied on calculators, therefore they are unable to do something simple on their real life for example when they go for a shopping they do not know how much is their change. Ċ Thirdly, an enormous number of devises have invented throughout history that can do a lot of work instead of people, and people have extremely relied on them. For instance if one day one of gadgets do not work in an office, workers refuse form working until that devise be repaired and start to work again . Ċ To sum up, technology has made our life easy. We can enjoy from our moments with them ( listen to our favorite music, what television, meet our friends via webcam and Internet ) , but sometimes it cause some problems for us too.From my point of view technology can be used in different ways, and it depends on people to how use them."
10071,"The range and quality of food that we can buy has changed because of technological and scientific advances. Some people regard this change as an improvement, while others believe that it is harmful. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The advancement in science and technology has led to the production of enormous types of food products. It has been argued by many that it's beneficial, whereas others believe that it's detrimental to our health. I support the former view, as I think that the quality of these products has improved due to strict assurance. Ċ In this era of science and technology, the eateries have changed so much that the items are readily available regardless of the season, and I support this improvement. There is production of different types of materials that have a unique taste and improved nature. Secondly, these edibles are easily available globally due to free trade. Moreover, due to strict checks on production, storage, transport, sale, and purchase of products, the result is of the finest condition and has a good nutritional value. For instance, Australia is the largest exporter of the dairy products. Thus, with the use of new techniques, humans enjoy a vast range of food articles. Ċ On the other hand, the orthodox belief is that the processed eating materials are harmful for the body. This view has the support of many social activists, who have a faith that the current raw material has carcinogens, which ultimately produce tumours. Furthermore, the genetically designed things will later on bring change in the genetic make-up of the humans, thereby making them vulnerable to many diseases. For example, the nomad groups of the Indo-Pak subcontinent follow the same principles. So, the increased number of cancers in the world is due to the commercially available artificial feeds. Ċ To conclude, with the advancement in every walk of life, humans have discovered a variety of beneficial items. The states have to keep a constant watch on the processes and should not compromise on the trait for a better future generation."
10072,"It is important to be concerned about international events, even if those events have no direct impact on our lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","It is widely believed that people do not necessarily need to pay attention to international events unless they have direct impacts on them. However, in my opinion, it is significant to be aware of events happening around the globe because we can still have indirect effects and we can come up with reliable measures when we are faced with similar issues. Ċ To begin with, even indirect implications from other countries' events can engender pernicious outcomes. For example, due to careless and reckless economic development by advanced countries, developing countries are now faced with climate change. Even though efforts to develop economies have no direct effects on other countries, their indirect implication is fatal: the threat to the humanity on earth. As a result, people around the globe are struggling with unprecedentedly high sea levels, extreme heat or cold, or depletion of the ozone layer. This climate change issue clearly represents how indirect effects can have lethal results on people in other countries. Ċ On top of this, by taking heed to international events, we can come up with reliable policies to deal with our own issues. For instance, when we witnessed how the United States and European countries coped with the Covid-19, we could learn lessons from them and were able to remove unsuccessful measures. As a consequence, we were successfully able to prevent significant virus spread into our communities around Australia. This example shows us why it is so important to pay attention to international events even though it does not have direct ramifications. Ċ To sum up, it is very important to be concerned about events occurring around the world as we can still have indirect but pernicious implications and also as we can come up with practical solutions to our own problems by learning from other countries' practices."
10073,"Today, many people do not know their neighbors in large cities. Ċ What problems does this cause? Ċ What can be done about this?","Nowadays, most people have little time to socialize with their neighbours. This is happened due to the busy life of individuals which is caused by economic problems they tackle with. This essay cites a few causes and provides some solutions to alleviate this issue. Ċ The main reason for this problem that the public does not know their neighbours is their busy lives. These days, individuals should work hard in order to provide well-fare for their families. For example, in a nuclear family, both man and woman might have a nine-to-five job in order to earn high revenue. On the other hand, there are always traffic jams in metropolitans, especially in rush hours. So employees are stuck in traffic and spend most of their time commuting. As a result, they have no energy to communicate with their neighbours on weekdays, and at the weekends they want to rest and regain their energy to start the week energetically. Ċ However, there are some solutions to make free hours to socialize with each other. Firstly, most countries have some traditional events nations celebrate. People could plan a ceremony to celebrate these special events together. For instance, they could gather in one’s home or if the building has a garden they could meet each other there. In addition, families who have children could let them play with each other and strike a friendship. In this way, the child’s parents meet and get to know others’ parents as well. Ċ In conclusion, economic situations and bustling lives are caused society to have less time to know the next-door families. But there are some suggested ways to rectify it, such as celebrating traditional events together or by allowing their children to strike a friendship."
10074,Many employees work at home using modern technology today. Some people think only workers and not employers benefit from it. To what extent do you agree or disagree? today's technology provides the new working methods,"As per the famous quote from Bill gates, ""We are changing the world with technology"", technological changes in the 21st century has brought a greater impact among the people. Some believe that the concept of working from home is advantageous only to employees and not for the management. I would state that it is beneficial to both the parties. Ċ From the member of staff perspective, it is definitely a boon. One gets their own flexible timings to finish up the work where a work-life balance can been maintained. For example, if someone is traveling from long distance to work daily, he/she can take the job from home. Thereby avoiding tensions like road traffic while traveling, to reach on-time to office etc., More than everything with the flexibility provided, workers tend to be loyal and their bond with the company grows for years. Ċ Providing work from home opportunities is not only helping the workers, but it is giving an upper hand to the management as well. During this fast communicative world, we use computers, laptops and mobile phones to attend to the work-related issues even without attending office. For instance, during an emergency situation at office, where it is already late night, manager can just ring up the worker to look into the issue from home. Instead of driving to office, the same time can be utilized to work on the problem where you get a chance to please the customer by solving the issue at the earliest. Ċ Having discussed about the benefits on both the sides, I would say that work at home can be encouraged which brings happiness and satisfaction to both employees and employers."
10075,"""The best way for a nation to prepare for the future is to invest more resources in its young people. How true do you think about it? What are the best ways to spend these resources?""","Young generation has a say in the destiny of a nation. While I agree that they should be largely invested, I personally think that this uncertainly guarantees the long - term development of a country. Ċ On the one hand, nurturing young generation well could be a feasible investment for the future. The young are often equipped with updated technology, being creative and enthusiastic. Therefore, they would easily to come up with new innovative ideas to heighten productivity of organizations. A country which pours money into the young could gain back high - skilled labor for years to come, making contribution to the sustainable development of the nation. Ċ However, I would argue that this way might have several risks if governments do not wisely invest in the young. Owing to being too young, they sometimes could be disoriented in their career paths. For example, if governments grant scholarships for distinguished students to study medication, but some of them later turn out to pursue their passions of working in other fields, like photographing or being a socialist; this would be a waste of money and effort. Ċ To prepare for the future in the best way, I would offer a suggestion that governments should invest resources in right subjects and emphasize on orienting students' future career. For example, before granting scholarships to outstanding students, universities or colleges should value their sense of purpose to make sure that they are investing in right potential talents. Also, there should be more job orientation workshops, guiding students to find out their passions early in life to avoid wasteful investments. Ċ In conclusion, young generation deserves to be most invested for the sake of the growth of a nation, but this policy should go hand - in - hand with career orientation for them."
10076,"Some people say that television is a very useful tool when it comes to education. Others argue that television is much overused, ineffective teacher. Discuss both of these views and give your opinion as to the usefulness of television as an educational tool.","Many people consider television as a beneficial tool for education, whereas others claim that TV can not be used as a teacher because it interferes a learning process and has insignificant positive effect on a child. This essay will show my opinion for both views. Ċ No one can deny that TV is an inevitable source of information, as it has suitable programs for different age groups with distinguishing backgrounds. Quiz shows, for instance, the most useful program for a teenager or student, because it can broaden one's mind. Apart from a real teacher, TV can explain the information as well as show it for a clear understanding. Taking children's playfulness into consideration, TV can attract their concentration by its vivid pictures. Therefore, TV is a necessary and effective tool in child's education. Ċ In contrast, the majority of people consider TV as a relaxation item, resulting in a higher demand for films and shows rather than educational programs. Even remaining TV programs with educational purposes are becoming complicated for children, because they are orientated a certain group of people. Moreover, the expansion of violent and brutal films has their negative impacts on children's behavior, interfering them from a learning process. Ċ To sum up, I have an impression that TV is mainly used for leisure purposes, Therefore, it is better for a child to avoid using TV as a tool for education."
10077,War has been around since the beginning of mankind. There have been many reasons for a war to start.  Discuss some of the reasons why wars are begun.,"Wars, which lead to environmental and economical damages, have become one of the most concerning issues for many governments all over the world. There are several causes of this alarming problem, which will be discussed in this essay. Ċ To begin with, natural resources might be considered as a primary reason for wars. When the number of inhabitants of a country increases rapidly, this puts a large amount of pressure on its natural resources. Therefore, countries, which have much more resource and weaker military, become the targets. A good example of this situation is Middle East countries, which rich in oils and land. They have been suffered from wars for many decades. Ċ Next, racial conflicts have resulted in wars for many centuries. In other words, biological differences lead to hostile and aggressive behaviors between nations and areas. For example, many civil wars took form of ethnic and national conflict in Australia, the USA and Vietnam. Even though in most cases ethno-national conflict seems to owe to claim over land and strategic resources, racism may lie behind these wars. Ċ Finally, religious clashes seem to be another reason for wars between countries or within country. Due to complication between Hindus and Muslim beliefs, individuals and groups within each religion often have different views. For example, citizens in India have been suffered from violence and high death toll as well as poor national development. Ċ To conclude, natural resources, racism and religions are three prevalent causes of wars that require urgent actions to alleviate their severe consequences."
10078,"As the number of private cars has increased, so too has the level of pollution in many cities. What can be done to tackle this increasingly common problem?","Up to the present time, the number of people driving private vehicles showed a dramatic rise. This has caused the environmental problems such as exhausted fumes of cars hampering life in urban areas. From my perspective, there are many factors that are required to develop evenly solving air contamination issue. In addition to, the government should ameliorate the situation. Ċ One potential solution of this problem is that the government should encourage car manufacturers to produce friendly-fueled transportations such as electric cars. For instance, for the past few decades, the government of China has offered monetary incentives to car manufacturers for each electric car they produce. Recent study showed that in Europe and in Asia, electric vehicles have grown in popularity. Therefore, all electric cars will help to reduce exhaust. Ċ In the other solution, the government should concentrate to maintain the comfortably public transportation with cost less expensive than using a private car. Recent survey showed that two in three people in London have been using public transportation because the cost of public transportation is more inexpensive than driving a private car.  In addition to, the British government has used the system since the twentieth century to restrict the number of private vehicles in the cities during the rush hours. Hence, this is all part of an effort to decrease greenhouses gases emitted from personal vehicles. Ċ In conclusion, the increasing of private cars harms the social environment by its encouragement to the higher level of pollution. In this case, the government, one of the policy makers, should be relied on, as the problem solver."
10079,Topic: Some people think that economic growth is the only way to stop the poverty and hunger. To what extent do you agree or disagree ? (write approximately 300 words) Solutions to curb the poverty and starvation,"It is believed that only economic progress can put a stop to the poverty and hunger. From my perspective, I disagree with this point of view. As far as I am concerned, there are many factors, which are more decisive and vital than economic development, can give rise to the decrease of the poverty and hunger in a country. Ċ First of all, In order to make a country become wealthier, an out-standing education system is a key factor. As we all know, education provides people many useful skills to develop and become talented. For instance, people are taught numerous moral lessons, which deters them from committing the crimes, and therefore become good residents for the societies. Additionally, well-educated people are also equipped with specialized knowledge. With know-how they have gained, people such as workers, doctors or engineers will have abilities to work efficiently as well as make great contributions to their countries. Ċ Another criterion to curb the poverty and starvation is the authority's policies. It is inevitable that the government's decisions will have tremendous impacts on the developments of the country. The authority's orders and plans are much more important than economic progress, simply because the leaders' strategies will lay the foundations for the nation's growth. If those in control focus on solving the starvation and allocating national budgets on supporting people who from low socio-economic background, the poverty and hunger will certainly decline. It is obvious that the authority is the root of every nation. The positive contributions of the responsible leaders will, therefore, lead to the country's prosperity and set a limit on hunger and poverty rate. Ċ All in all, even though economic growth is crucial to the development of a nation, I personally think that an excellent education system and the responsible government are much more important in reducing the poverty and hunger."
10080,"In many parts of the world, families were larger in the past because people had more children. Do you think there were more advantages or disadvantages to being part of a large family in the past?","In the past, there were several people to live with many members in home, so they had lots of children and big families. They felt comfortable even had to share everything with the members and took more advantages than possessed in a small family. Ċ The greatest challenge for parents who had a lot of children was money. They tried hard to earn big incomes, so they could fulfill daily necessities of all the relatives. After their children in school ages, they had to spend more dollars to send them to qualified schools as education would very important for young generations in the future. Parents also needed money to build their houses larger to accommodate relatives, extended the rooms for them, and bought some stuffs. Moreover, parents had to pay more attention which was shared to their children. They might be difficult to managing their tasks of works and listening stories of their children. Ċ However, I argue having bigger families give more benefits for people. Firstly, Children would learn about responsibilities when there were some activities in home because members could divide it. This character would bring them to be more mature. Owning large families also upgraded intelligence of individuals. For example, when they discussed some issues, they would give knowledge or views one and another. Finally, when children had grown up, parents would not feel lonely because the members would be more and bigger. Furthermore, the children could collaborate to work together. Ċ To sum up, big family would give some problems money and attention in particular. On the other hand, I believe the advantages outweighed the drawback because it created stronger relationship, supported and helped each other when they got the problems."
10081,Machines are taking over more and more jobs previously done by humans. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages and give your own opinion.,"Nowadays there is a growing concern over the substitution of humans for machines. A great number of positive and negative aspects of this revolution are being discussed by experts. I believe that the disadvantages clashes with the advantages. I will discuss some of these incentives and drawbacks in this essay. Ċ On one hand, machines have undoubtedly brought us a lot of benefits. First, the arduous occupations which are not only dangerous for employees but also implausible are being done by vehicles now. Secondly, it has resulted in manufacturing products in huge amounts with faster and better outcomes. For example, it takes about a year for a human to weave a carpet by hand while machines are producing hundreds of carpets with various designs in a day. lastly, a portion of expenses of products is being paid to the staffs which can be omitted and result in cheaper products. Ċ On the other hand, although there are definitely some benefits with machinery product, it has brought us a lot of problems. For years artificial intelligence had been viewed as a safe substitute for mankind but recently people are taking a fresh look at it after mistakes that have been made by it. For instance, surgeon robots were expected to provide better surgery on patients; on the contrary, they have resulted in many deaths. In addition, watching machines doing our chores might be preferable to doing them by ourselves but it suffers from disadvantages that put a lot of people at risk of unemployment. Moreover, laziness will ensue. Ċ To sum up, designing vehicles to do the human's responsibilities concludes to a faster job with less effort and expenses. I am not completely in agreement with the above-said view because more defects, unemployment, and inactivity are inevitable drawbacks that should be taken into account."
10082,Local governments are pushing companies to move from large cities to regional locations. What are the benefits and drawbacks of this? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience,"Nowadays, governments are trying to encourage companies to migrate to the countryside from urban settings. And, there are many pros and cons of this transition. Both the sides will be elaborated in detail in the further essay. Ċ To begin with the advantages of this migration, I think the pollution emitted from large factories and industries in cities has increased alarmingly in recent years. So, with this displacement the citizens will be benefitted largely as the air, water and soil would be pollution-free. Secondly, tremendous growth in the macro and micro-businesses can be expected if the factories shift to regional areas. For example, the poor or illiterate daily wagers who live in faraway areas can get opportunities to work. Ċ In contrast, there are also certain drawbacks which cannot be ignored, such as the prospected destruction of Greenlands. If the companies are moved to regional areas which are lavishly green, need to be cut down to make room for the construction of huge buildings. Moreover, wildlife would get affected as they would lose their habitat in this process and this might badly affect the bio-cycle of wild animals. For illustration, the polar bears of Australia had to shift to South Africa in the process of urbanisation. Hence, there are also a few disadvantages of this change. Ċ In conclusion, the relocation of industries from urban settings to rural settings has its own benefits and drawbacks. But if the authorities make certain rules and regulations, then it can be implemented in a positive manner for all."
10083,"Some people think that genetically modified (GM) crops are a positive development. Other, however, argue that they are potentially dangerous. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","It is arguable whether the advantages of genetically modified (GM) crops outweigh the disadvantages. Ċ Some people believe that laboratory-modified seed would bring many positive benefits in the future. Firstly, GM crops will provide a higher level of production which is in favour of satisfying the demand for more food due to the ever growing world population. Secondly, by adding vitamins, the food becomes more nutrient-rich and thus, after a meal you feel satiated. Moreover, genetically engineered plants are adaptive to the adverse weather conditions in some regions, which is a step to the solution of the global hunger problem. Ċ On the other hand, people who oppose the widespread GM techniques claim that there might me a lot of potential dangers. They are concerned because scientists have not proved yet if gene modification is fully safe for people, and also if there will be long-term consequences of the environment and the wildlife. For instance, there is evidence that pollen could be spread by the wind to the GM-free plantations. As a result, people would not be sure of the quality and content of their products. Another aspect, people are being worried about is the chemical pollution from the products used on crops and if animals would be contaminated by eating GM crops and further constitute a danger for humans who consume fresh meat. Ċ As a conclusion, I think that to address this issue people should raise awareness of the possible effects. More studies must be conducted on the long-term consequences of genetic modification in order any speculations to be avoided."
10084,Punishment is a good way to address the behavioural problem in children. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that to tackle the children's behavioural issues, corporal punishment is an effective measure. However, I disagree with this idea because of its various negative consequences. Ċ One main reason to avoid punishment to the children in various body and mind problems. Firstly, as some parents and teachers use whips and sticks to leash the adolescents, various physical problems such as bruises, scratches and even fractures can happen. For instance, the death of 16 children in the last fiscal year is an example of such events, in which they were beaten by their teachers to death. Secondly, punishing a child can result in numerous psychological problems. The confidence of children can lose having born frequent punishments. It is because of the fear punishment that they might not be bold enough to take steps to tackle the day-to-day activities. So, punishing the child can lead to an ill generation. Ċ Moreover, giving punishment to control the behaviour of offsprings may not be good for society. Owning to the monkey see, monkey do mentality, they learn the things from the owner observation. In other words, after getting punishments often, the might think that it is the only way to carry out the things. In short, aggressiveness becomes their second nature and the like to treat aggressively for every member of society. Furthermore, children can forget how to respect educators and parents after being punished by them. Obviously, a negative image of elders is generated in their minds after getting bad treatment even after minor mistakes. Therefore, they lose the virtues of respect and love that is must for a healthy society. Ċ In conclusion, although it is believed that children's bad behaviour can be better handled with the corporal punishments. I assert that it should be avoided because of its demerits like less sociable generation, physical and mental ailments."
10085,"The use of violence in music lyrics, video games and films seen by children is causing concern in many societies. What problems may be caused by this type of violent imagery, and what steps could be taken to lessen the impact on young people?","In the modern world, children are given many opportunities, and because of this, they are faced with problematic issues that have severe effects on them and cause concerns. Using violence in music lyrics, video games, and films seen by children is one of the problems. This essay will discuss the most serious problem arising, and also two ways in which the situation can be improved. Ċ Arguably the gravest problem is that youth, at a younger age, imitate and act every behaviour and action they see. Inappropriate movies and games for their age allow them to learn behaviours that they can not distinguish right from wrong. Talking with the wrong tone, weird eating habits, or breaking house rules can be due to improper behaviours in the movies. A further serious impact is that it can affect their mental health. Violent music can make them overly excited, and movies or games can make them aggressive and jeopardize their relationship with those around them and their families. For instance, many studies show that the rate of crime has increased among youngsters, and watching unfit scenes can be one of the reasons. Ċ To counteract these dangers, the most effective and immediate solution would be controlling, which means parents should supervise their youngsters to avoid harsh scenes. They should be careful that kids do not watch violent sceneries in different types of movies or programs. Furthermore, they should not give kiddies too many gadgets, such as smartphones or computers, and Wi-Fi passwords that juniors can easily access everything. Another step is for the government to monitor the programs that are broadcast on television or the games that are sold. For example, through the media and public relations, families should be informed to pay more attention to the programs that their children watch. Ċ To conclude, violent scenes are seen everywhere and cause aggression and inappropriate behaviour. The government and families must have more control over young adults to resolve this issue."
10086,Today's children are living under more pressure from the society than in the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.,"Many people believe that social life in this globalising era have pressured children more than they used to be in the past. It is true that in recent age many children are striving to reach their bright future. However, from my point of view, children in the past had experienced more social disturbances such as racial issue and lowborn family status. Ċ These days, many people have considered global competition as the biggest obstacle for children's lives. Compared to the past life which almost everybody can live only by traditional field work, in present the children have to prepare their future more carefully. William Dunbar, an economist, reported that average living cost in Europe had risen by 20% each year from 2002 to 2010. Therefore, the kids must study hard in order to get a proper occupation which can support their future lives. In all, high competition rate can be disstressful for children these days. Ċ On the other hand, there are a lot of reason to say that in the past, children strived more than today's kids. It is a common knowledge that racism is one of the biggest issue faced by society, particularly in 18th century. For negroid children, this case was extremely depressing because they had been looked down by the society while they had to work as a slave. Not only that, homogenous society of the middle age also gave a huge pressure for the children. The local children had no choice but worked hard for their land lord for free, so that they just had a little time to enjoy their childhood. Ċ To sum up, it is evident that children in the past received much more pressure compared to today's kids by the presence of forced labour. In my opinion, societies should not give children a lot of pressure to prepare their future lives because the kids need to enjoy they childhood first."
10087,"Many people feel it is a waste of money to try to save endangered animal species, for example the tiger or the blue whale. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","People have different views about whether it is necessary for using money to attempt to protect threatened animal species. To a certain extent, I agree that spending money to preserve these kinds of animal is totally worth it. However, I also think that there are other existed issues in the world need to be solved. Ċ First of all, wild creatures play a significant role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. The loss of ecosystem balance may cause huge impacts in many fields of the globe such as economy, education or science. For example, it can create a lot of catastrophe like a thunderstorm or tsunami which destroy any financial center and cause economic collapse. Secondly, younger generations may lack knowledge about some kinds of species and lose the chance to analyze them. Just imagine how bad it is if our next generations have no clue about panda when they see a picture. Lastly, the planet needs the diversity of species and animals all depend upon each other for survival. Ċ At the same time, in addition to protecting the endangered creature, I also believe that our Earth has many other problems that we need to work on. For example, with Covid-19 pandemic, the world needs to deal with a lot of problems: loss of human life, economic and social disruption, employment and labor issues and every single problem is in a state of emergency. The Government and authorities need to consider what is the most essential issues at the moment, so that money can be used rationally not only for animals but also for people in the world. Ċ In conclusion, while I disagree with those who claim that it is a wastage of money when using for preserving wildlife, I also think that there are other concerns that need to be solved. If we can work on these logically, we can improve the world generally."
10088,Should Schools Require Foreign Languages? Question: Students who are not talented in foreign language learning should not be required to study a foreign language. Do you agree or disagree?,"Learning a foreign language is difficult for a student who does not have the talent. Some people think that government schools should provide courses of a foreign language as a mandatory subject, but other people argue that students should spend their time on other subjects if they are not gifted in foreign language learning. I agree that learning a foreign language in government schools will give students a good environment of education and develop their competitive skill. Ċ Schools can provide students a good education to learn a new language, especially for not gifted students. Firstly, they can be taught a fundamental knowledge of a foreign language from the teachers in government schools. Teachers can stimulate their interest in studying the language and help them to develop a skill of the language. Secondly, they can practice with their classmates who learn the language better. Those not talented students can get benefits of learning a foreign language from the mandatory subject in school and their classmates. Ċ People, speaking a foreign language fluently, obtain a competitive ability in the global employment. Although some people are not good at learning new languages, they can gain a basic knowledge of a foreign language in school. When they work in the foreign country or serve consumers of the foreign country, they could manage their duty better than the others who have never learned the language. People can have better employment opportunities if they studied the foreign language in government schools. Ċ In conclusion, Students maybe pay a lot of effort on learning a foreign language. However, the mandatory courses in school are the basic way for them to obtain a useful ability in the future."
10089,Do you agree or disagree that the effects of increased global tourism are more likely to be more harmful than beneficial?,"The flow of global tourism has been dramatically increased for the past few years because of the help of media and technologies. I agree, that the increased of tourism of one's country has no beneficiAls effects because it can lead to environmental distraction despite of earning profits in it. Ċ The positive effects of tourism has big impact in one country because of economic growth. It also attract more investors to put more business and facilitate more employment rate especially who live in the province whereas, opportunity is less and not establish compare in the city . For example, they can build establishment like malls and give more people jobs other than agriculture and fishing. Ċ About negative effects of tourism it can lead to environmental distractions. To give illustration in these, like in the zoo and resorts .Although, they can attract more tourist and promotes one places however people can never seen the other side effects in it. It can endanger of natural resources Because of to much using it likewise, mining and killing exotic animals for money. Aside from these example, the increase of prostitution because of influence of other cultures. Ċ In my views, there is a positive and negative effects of global tourism in one country but I think that the government can provide resolution to minimize the employment rate and poverty of their people like developing their natural resources and agricultures."
10090,"Some people believe that children should spend all of their free time with their families. Ċ Others believe that this is unnecessary or even negative. Discuss the possible arguments on both Ċ sides, and say which side you personally support!","No one denies the idea that parents play a pivotal role in children's development. It is even strongly suggested that they ideally use most their spare time with their parents. However, there exists an opposing view, assuming that children should also spend part of their childhood with their peers. This essay will discuss both views and reach the conclusion. Ċ On the one hand, it may appear advisable for children to live with their parents exclusively. Some parents believe that this the best way in which they educate ground rules, such as character, code of conduct and other proper behaviour. Furthermore, parents can monitor children’s development directly and even can make some necessary anticipations if their children misbehave. This also minimises the children to receive any bullying both verbally or physically from their peers which may lead to distract the children’s mentality development in the future. Although the children are strongly suggested to spend most of their time with their parents, this does not mean that they are not encouraged to interact with their peers because they also need to develop their interpersonal and social skills through interaction with their friends. Ċ On the other hand, we also have to ask whether this view is applicable or not in modern society since the parents tend to work eight hours a day (for instance) in capital cities where its living cost demands them to produce more money to meet their basic needs. Consequently, the parents could not be always available for the children during rush hour. Therefore, childcare will be a viable option for them. The children will have a lot of times to socialise with their peers in the childcare, meaning that they will develop their social skills naturally. This appears to be a suitable learning environment if it is conducted under careful supervision of nurses, hopefully bullying can be minimised among children during the class in the childcare. Ċ To sum up, while children should expend most of the time with their parents, they also need to have more space to interact with their peers, hoping that they would develop their social skills through interaction. It is all about balancing portion between spending time with parents and interaction because both of them are crucial for the children's developmental phase in the early age."
10091,Fewer and fewer young people are choosing to become teachers. Why do young people not want to be teachers? How could this be changed? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is a large drop in the number of graduates applying in the field of pedagogy year on year. It is worth analyzing the reasons for this worrying trend and discussing innovative strategies to reverse this matter. Ċ The reduction in the popularity of teaching is related to economic, and social factors, as well as health issues. Firstly, it is clear that salaries for those working in education are significantly lower than other sectors such as the finance and banking sector, or even the industrial field. Unversity-leavers are invariably reluctant to become teaching staff with accepting lew incomes while well-qualified graduates can receive well-paid incomes and higher career prospects. In addition, university lecturers and tutors are of the opinion that they no longer benefit from the respect they used to have. Their jobs had had the same social status in society as doctors, scientists, lawyers. Finally, a considerable number of academics have undergone pressure from the workload and been tired of poorly behaved students in the classes. Ċ A range of new approaches might be used to arrest this decline. The authorities ought to permit tax-free to those working in the educational field, and give more incentive incomes to those teaching with dedication and commitment. Funding more money for schools will be hugely beneficial to head-teachers and principals, who can employ more diligent and gifted graduates. A large number of awareness-raising campaigns and events should be organized to honor talented individuals and those contributing extreme efforts in training and teaching. Ċ In conclusion, the reasons and the ways to reverse the reduction stated earlier above. This dilemma will continue to fall unless the government takes action immediately. However, I fervently believe that civil servants will not prioritize this issue."
10092,which professions need more appreciation? Doctors and nurses make a great contribution to society and should be paid more than entertainment and sports celebrities  Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, with the evolution of media, it seems that idols and sports stars are paid largely more than those who contribute to society like health care workers and instructors. Many debates have been raised. Some believe that contributors should earn more than entertainers. I'm in line with this idea and would express my opinions below. Ċ First and foremost, the major rationale for providing well pays to doctors and nurses is that they are the one who has a considerable contribution to the public community. Every day and night, medical personnel make the best to take care of and cure the patients sent to hospitals. Always bearing heavy pressure on people's lives, medical workers are frustrated and tortured by every working day, including dealing with death. Furthermore, nurturing a doctor or a nurse takes much time. When a person decides to work in a hospital, at least 6 years are gone in life for more studies in school. Ċ Owing to lots of adversities which they would encounter and the contribution they make, I believe they should earn more money than other careers, especially entertainers like actors or singers who always receive a higher salary. Although others might think that idols can bring their fans much love and passions, especially when they feel desperate in life. That means, idols are kind of incentives for some people to be alive. However, I still believe that saving one's life needs more technical processes and knowledge. Ċ All in all, although I fully recognise the role superstars play to make people laugh and induce them to enjoy life, I reckon that medical workers deserve higher pays because of their work and contribution."
10093,"When employers choose the best person for a job they should consider personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Getting a job opportunity in the current competitive world is a challenging task. It is believed that when choosing the right candidate, instead of considering the experience and the education, the employer should focus on personal qualities. I disagree with this statement for two reasons. One is why the qualification is important, and the other one is how experience plays a vital role during employment. Ċ Firstly, a company should focus on relevant qualifications according to their roles and responsibilities. It gives fundamental knowledge about the subject that people study. For example, to work in an automotive industry production line, the person should be qualified either in the mechanical or automobile field. This helps the employer to train the person as quickly as possible rather than spending more money on training. Moreover, the individual character is one of the criteria’s during the interview ,and not the deciding factor. As a result, companies’ vision can be easily achieved. Ċ Secondly, job experience is highly required than self-qualities. Many companies are struggling to find the right candidate for a specific role. This cannot be achieved by recruiting a fresh employee considering the individual strength and give him/her training for a number of months. For instance, to fulfil the requirement in the field of software development, a highly experienced professional is mandatorily required to finish any project within the timeline. Therefore, it is vital for an employer to recruit a candidate with some set of skills in the relevant field. Ċ To conclude, nothing can compromise in considering the required field of study and on the job exposure for a particular role. It is recommended that one should have exposed themselves in their field of interest and gain knowledge."
10094,"In some parts of the world, the rate of divorce has increased dramatically over the past few decades. Explain some possible reasons for this problem and suggest some solutions.","In line with the shift in time, a recent phenomenon on dramatical increase in divorce indicates some concerns in terms of problems from getting married. This essay will elaborate on some probable causes and positive solutions which can improve this situation Ċ There are concerning reasons leading couples to split up and even go to divorce. Firstly, many married couples live with extended family, therefore, conflicts may occur between the young and the old generation during daily activities. For instance, young couple likely to have parties with friends at home but their parents assume those activities as ill-manners need to be fixed. Hence, young couple feel unhappy and depressed in their relationship. Secondly, having child costs married people more than when they are single. In the past, family usually helps pairs with taking care of their kids and helping them with expenses. However, present married duos have to manage everything, especially when their kids are still newborn, they look after their children and work to pay the bills at the same time. For that reason, they get much burden and depression. Ċ However, this situation can be improved by some possible solutions. The young and the elderly in extended family can confess with each other and find out a way to neutralize the lifestyle and bridge the gap between generations. Besides, married pairs may have therapy with psychologist before and during their marriage. These activities help them to relieve the stress and concerns they hold in their relationship. Ċ In conclusion, , by conducting some positive solutions to resolve common negative thoughts and feeling of married people, this situation would be better."
10095,"Topic: Nowadays, most large companies operate multi-nationally. To what extent those companies should have responsibility towards local communities in which they operate? businesses and their responsibility","Due to the globalization, several firms establish their branches in many different countries throughout the world. These international companies , nevertheless, should be accountable to local citizens in terms of the environment and the native culture. Ċ First factor that the multinational enterprises should take responsible for is the national ecosystem. It is obvious that the international organizations need to safeguard the native environment, which means they cannot pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere or tip hazardous waste into rivers. Due to the fact that local residents depend on natural resources to survive. If these firms threatened the ecosystem, the inhabitants may not have health food or pure air to develop . For instance, the company Formosa, which is located in Taiwan, invests in Vietnam and they harm the living conditions by releasing domestic waste into rivers. Their actions killed an excessive amount of marine creatures and exert adverse impacts on local people's health and quality of life. Ċ More importantly, global operations ought to respect the national customs where they set up. In other words, the firms should discover insights into the native cultures and deter themselves from offending indigenous people or what they respect. For example, when running business in Thailand, the organizations cannot advertise their products by using pictures of royal Kings as Thai citizens extremely respect royal family. Therefore, international operations should develop carefully and stay away from some taboos, which offend the inhabitants. Ċ Another aspect global companies should take into account when investing in other areas is to create more careers for local people. The leaders have to guarantee local workers' rights, including paying enough incomes for indigenous employees or pay for workers' insurance. Ċ In conclusion, companies who operate multinationally should have responsible for the local communities in which they invest in in many aspects, ranging from living conditions and native cultures to job opportunities."
10096,Since traveling abroad has become relatively inexpensive more countries are opening their doors for foreign tourists. Is it a positive or negative trend? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.,"Nowadays,people usually travel to foreign nations as moving abroad has become cheaper and the countries are providing visas without too many restrictions for travellers.I profoundly assert it is a positive trend because of multifarious factors like economic development and introducing skills to the region.However,I would like to explicate my views in the upcoming paragraphs. Ċ To commence with,the first and foremost benefit is the circulation of the money flows fastly in the economy because of the elevating number of tourists.It will not only diminish unemployment related issues but also it will improve the country's GDP.For instance,the countries like Dubai where the tourism sector plays a paramount role in regional development.According to a survey by the ""International Agency of TourismAdd a comma,TourismIt appears that you are missing a comma after the introductory phrase According to a survey by the ""International Agency of Tourism. Consider adding a comma. Ċ show examples"" it was crystal clear that around 40% of the country's income is generated from the tourism sector.For this reason,countries have opened their doors and are promoting tourism that will act as a blessing for the nation and its denizens. Ċ In addition to it,the youngsters travelling to then developed countries often carry certain skills that will benefit some sectors of the nation in spite of providing educational loans the nations are giving huge rebates to attract the youth.For example,in ,Canada they have opened their immigration department even in the pandemic and were providing numerous benefits to the students like unlimited part-time working hours.As a result, their major factory related work and IT sector jobs were fulfilled by giving myriad benefits to the people outside their region. Ċ In conclusion,I certainly believe that in this contemporary world people are usually moving to the developed nations in search of better employment opportunities as well as it leads to the generation of income in the society.Subsequently,different nations are promoting tourism in their countries besides it they are providing several advantages to the youth that makes it cheaper for the teenagers to settle in the country of their choice."
10097,"Many people say that human society has developed into a “throw-away” society, which is filled with plastic bags and rubbish. What are the causes and solutions?","it is argued that the world has tended to modify into a throw-away society, which contains plastic bags and garbage. There are some reasons behind this phenomenon and several solutions should be adopted to improve the situation. Ċ The main reason is the convenience of using plastic and lower costs, numerous human beings prefer to use various these products, which is seen as more efficient and hygienic. However, used plastic products thrown are detrimental to the environment of water and soils, which further causes the problem of protection of animals. Studies reveal that plastic bags are often used once and be seen in sea and soils giving rise to about 100,00 animals deaths each year. In addition, another important factor contributing to this phenomenon is over-packaging. Packaging has become an important part of selling. Therefore, the producers are more likely to attract consumers by using more splendid packing made in plastics that are non-degradable materials. Ċ To solveChange the verb formSolvingTo solve doesn’t seem to work here. Ċ show examples this problem requires concerted efforts. Firstly, individuals should adopt the habits of purchasing eco-friendly products. For illustrate, instead of buying mineral water packed in a plastic bottle, we could use a glass bottle that can be repeatedly used. A second measure is that enterprises, as the main culprit, should decrease the use of plastics in the packaging of their products. Lastly, the government also plays a vital role in slowing this trend, such as putting legal limits on over-packaging, which has proved an effective way to reduce the production of plastics. Ċ In conclusion, consumer society and over-packaging have given rise to this throw-away society. Individuals, governments, and enterprises should take the responsibility to reduce the amount of waste and save the earth."
10098,Scientific research should be funded by the government rather than the commercial organisation. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"It is important to consider why scientific exploration is important for the advancement of a country. While some people believe government funding for scientific studies instead of private industries. In my opinion, the local authorities should have absolute financial responsibilities on the studies. Ċ First and foremost, the public tends to believe the credibility of the foundings by the public institutions. Because the government authorities must be accountable for their people protection. On the other hand, private sectors trustworthiness suffers. For instance, the investigation of tobacco proves there are severe health issues. Even though, the private corporation funded explorations won't provide favourable outcome on that. As a result, people put their confidence in the unbiased analysis. Ċ Another importance is that government conduct researches are purely for improving real people's lives despite the monetary benefits. The knowledge gain by the explorations is freely available to the public because they are funded by their tax money. Therefore, they can apply knowledge to enhance or improve their living standards. For example, researches on solar energy and space exploration granted immense improvements for publics. Moreover, universities and academics can participate in researches for free of cost to improve the research. However, if, private industries invests in researches purely in gaining profit. They will not launch any researches that valuable to the public, because there is no fiscal gain. Therefore, for the progression of society, public officials financing is paramount to take control of scientific research. Ċ In conclusion, I believe local authorities are the right partners for implementing scientific researches. While Official authorities will consider benefits the whole community, private corporation invest in such research gaining commercial results is predominant."
10099,medical professionals such as doctors and nurses from poorer countries often migrate to richer countries to work. what problems arise from this situation? what measures can be taken to deal with it?,"Health care workers have to struggle a lot to earn a better lifestyle in the developing nations. Therefore, a large number of them are seen to be moving to the developed countries. This essay will discuss the issues that will emerge from these conditions and will talk about the various methods that can be adopted so as to ensure that the home country is not left without any medical professionals. Ċ Some of the major problems associated with the economic migration of health workers are, that the nation will be left out will less number of the people with medical expertise. Additionally, the experienced staff to train the students will be lagging, thereby compromising on the level of services provided to the people. For example, clinical knowledge and its practical application can only be passed from an experienced expert. Hence, shortage of the medical knowledge in a country can be extremely damaging for its society. Ċ Even though these are severe problems, solutions for them are available. To begin with, government can provide better financial aid to the medical professionals which would help them grow economically, for instance, sixth pay commission, which is available to the government employees can be employed for them as well leading to their financial growth. Moreover, the movement of the doctors to other countries can be restricted by imposing strict laws, for example, higher fees for the immigration process. All these solutions may help in limiting the movement of health care providers. Ċ In conclusion, these days medicos are leaving their home country to foreign land for lucrative job offers. This essay discussed that lack of experts to treat and train will be some of the major issues which can be solved by providing better pay and making strict rules for immigration of health workers."
10100,"Some people feel that manufacturers and super markets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Other agree that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views, and give your opinion.","It is controversial issues as to whether the public abstains from purchasing products with lots of wrappings, or, whether the producers and supermarkets should be careful in packaging any goods that several Styrofoams, papers, or plastic do not go in one product. From my perspective, packaging is, completely, depending on the companies' manufacturers so that they ought to be attentive in this regard rather than clients. Ċ To begin with, these days, most of the manufacturing industries are producing different types of products such as gift hampers, household appliances, fabrics et Cetra that are wrapped with various sorts of foil papers. The reason is that if they cover their products with different substances, like plastics, papers, Styrofoams respectively, it will be protected during transportation time. However, they should have to observe the negative consequences of extra packaging, which causes pollution in the environment. Moreover, if they use less plastic over in products, it reduces the greater amount of the costs of producing goods. As a result, it will be carried in a facile manner. Therefore, all the shoppers and product management teams have to be concerned with excessive wrapping of products. Ċ On the other hand, it is justifiable to say that clients need to avoid buying items, which have lots of wrappings. However, at times, it becomes essential for the people who cannot abstain themselves in taking those extra-wrapped objects. For example, in the USA, the kitchen tools are level with different types of extra layers, which the client has nothing do to but buy these electronic appliances. For that reason, the company has to be careful not to use too many extra boxes at the time of transportation. This is because clients will neither avoid purchasing the necessities of life, nor throw this extra paper in safe places which would help not to pollute the atmosphere. Ċ In conclusion, although how much extra packets should add to a product rely on the manufacturers and high raised markets, some people believe that the public must retain products which are less in wrapping. In my opinion, companies have better look into products as if it contains only one wrapping instead of the public."
10101,Fast-food companies should not be allowed to give away free toys with their food. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"For years complementary toys that were provided by restaurants had been viewed as an incentive for parents and children but people are taking a fresh look at it recently. Some people argue that this strategy should be banned due to some concerns regarding health. I agree with such a statement; however, offering gifts to entice children to eat food might be acceptable in some conditions that will be discussed in this essay. Ċ On the one hand, the negative impact of the twenty-first-century diet, which contains a lot of high-fat and high-salt dishes, is out of the question. Fast food as the most popular meal among children is being prepared with overused oil and a non-standard amount of salt to taste better. Consequently, it has brought us plenty of disadvantages, like obesity. Fortunately, with an increasing level of education on this predicament, parents have been trying to reduce these dangers by avoiding those types of meals. In the meanwhile, the big companies have started to encourage the public to buy their products again with the new tempting offers. For instance, calming down a crying girl with a cute doll that comes along with french fries convinces parents to pay for it and have a peaceful dinner. Ċ On the other hand, convincing toddlers to eat properly is challenging for most families. It is noteworthy to bear in mind, tempting our offspring to be fed with such incentives is a brilliant strategy. Although the initial aim of this plan was not in the best interest of youngsters, we can take advantage of it by appropriately deviating its purpose. For example, giving away these presents with vegetables and salads. Moreover, the truth is that these toys are not our main problem, the way of preparing junk food is the most serious issue. Imposing policies to comply with franchised restaurants to healthy standards needs to be located above all. Subsequently, complementary toys would not cause any harm. Ċ To sum up, I agree that the growing concern over fast-food consumption and their intrigues are coherent and should be addressed. Furthermore, offering presents as a motive can be used to promote healthier cuisine in restaurants."
10102,"People these days watch TV, films and other programmes alone rather than with other people. Ċ Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages","Nowadays, online platforms of streaming are becoming popular among certain adults and adolescents. While the majority of people tend to watch entertainment with others, some people feel that it’s common to watch alone. In my opinion, the drawbacks related to watching TV do not outweigh the positives. Ċ More and more people fancy enjoying their programs on TV alone due to their insular viewing habits. Firstly, they can concentrate on their own movies without consulting others. Secondly, watching shows alone allows great flexibility. For example, choosing entertainment that matches their taste. An individual can pause, stop and switch to other programs freely. In my opinion, watching entertainment without disturbing others can be more convenient. Ċ The main disadvantage of individual watching personality is loosened social bonds between family members. Moreover, in the past, the family might watch TV together, joke about it, discuss ideas, exchange feelings through the films and then have a common point of reference for later conversations. However, when it comes to the modern era, everything seems to be a more self-reliant society. Taking Netflix for instance, this application has been created for individual users. This streaming platform picks up some movies from individual subscribers’ interests, not from all members’ interests. These issues might be affected the relationship between members and may be difficult to reverse. Ċ To conclude, enjoying the shows on TV together has benefits in terms of maintaining the connection between family members. Personally, this is a negative development of social media platforms despite it isWrong verb formbeingIt appears that your sentence or clause uses an incorrect form of the verb is. Consider changing it. Ċ show examples extremely convenient for you."
10103,"Many people believe that TV news and media in general have a detrimental effect on our life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion, including relevant examples.","It is believed by many of the people that the Television news and media have a negative effect on our life. We cannot deny the fact that Television news and media serve all the information and news without any delay and it helps to improve our General Knowledge and update ourselves about the current affairs. However, In my opinion, I feel that a lot of detrimental effects on people's life are caused by the diverting, inappropriate, and manipulating news showed in the TV channels. Ċ Firstly, the news we get is not always the highest priority news happening in the world, as the channels decide what to show the people and what opinion the viewers should have on that incident. For example, If there is a news on a scam on bullet proof jackets purchased for the Army men, the news channels that are directly or indirectly funded by the ruling party, will avoid showing that content. Rather, it will highlight a news report on an actress playing the role of a Goddess and received threats by the leaders of a particular community or religion. Ċ Secondly, when the news agitates, they will not follow up on that issue. Instead, they will focus on some other interesting issue, that can give the channel the most viewer ratings. Although the channels are swift in delivering the news, I would say that they are not responsible enough to focus on what is relevant to the society. For instance, a protest on the methane extraction project in Tamilnadu, which may cause serious drought in a decade, will not get the continuous follow-up and highlight as it loses an entertainment factor. This news can be over-shadowed by any news that has a religious new or a news from the film industry. Ċ In conclusion, the TV channels can be more accountable for what they show and they should realise that their job is just to report the happenings and not to take any side of the issue. Moreover, they should take care whether the content is appropriate for the audience and provide priority to the ones that will have a huge impact on the society."
10104,Many people believe that increasing levels of violence on television and in films is having a direct result on levels of violence in society. Others claim that violence in society is the result of more fundamental social problems such as unemployment. Ċ How much do you think society is affected by violence in the media?,"Nowadays, violent activities are on the rise at an alarming rate, and this has a massive impact on our society. Several individuals are trying to scour the root cause of it, and some believe that actions shown on television and movies are the main reason, whereas others think that it is an outcome of unemployment and other social issues. In my opinion, both are responsible for propagating such ideologies among people. In this essay, we shall discuss this topic further. Ċ Television and movies have gained a tremendous amount of popularity over the past few decades, and in a way it reaches the human mind. Furthermore, many people idealize such films and characters and try to replicate the fictional scenes into reality. For instance, action scenes on movies broadcasting fighting, shooting or theft as a piece of cake, and most people fail to realise that those works just imaginative, and have taken place in a controlled environment. Additionally, the accessibility of such channels has made it even more difficult to avoid such negativity. Ċ On the other hand, some situation is out of people’s control, unlike movies and television which is strictly under viewers discretion. Moreover, social and economic conditions of an individual also lures an individual in the wrong direction. For example, unemployment has led to extreme distress and discomfort among individual and this affects their mental health and ultimately draws them towards criminal activities. Ċ In conclusion, the aetiology of such violence cannot be confined to a single opinion, rather it is the combined levels of different events and circumstance."
10105,It is becoming increasingly expensive for museums to be open to the public. What would be the best solution to keep them open in your opinion,"Historical houses demand a high budget revenue on its renovation and restoration of the prestige artifacts.So it is quite hard for them to provide free exposure to mases.However,there are some measures dicussed in upcoming dissertion which i believe can be really helpful to provide free ticket for people to experience history. Ċ To commence, the most prominent reason for this trend is the mammoth expenditure on musems and that is why the authorities find difficult to raise the budget for proper ongoing of such places.Therefore, funds should be raised by government for the repair cost of ancesrtorical buildings, this can be done by : making populace aware about historical and by managing ceratin instituonial trips to the muesems.Consquently, if people are aware about the pivotal role of history they will tend to donate; if students will join the expedition not only they will know about the crucial past but the tour fees can be given to infratstructer owners for a sound regulation. Consequently, less is the debt on these places more are the chances for public to experience for free. Ċ In addition one of the obstructive effect is , demand for fees by keepers of heritage so the question arises ,wheteher the fund should be used on cultural products or on the workers ?.Perhaps, both requires a substantial fund, and for proper balance certain taxes can be imposed on the tourists for giving the priceless cultural and traditional knowledge.For example, recently opened partition muesem in Amritsar demands for 100 rippes for a foriengner and the rate for locals are only 20 rupees.Hence, some measure of taxing can be followed on outsiders but not on nearby residence beacuse they are rightful proponents for there ansectors role in the past. Ċ To summarize, denizens truily deserve a free pass to historical buildings this will really pivotal for nations development."
10106,"Some people think that to have a successful life you have to have university education, while others think it's not that important. Discuss both views and give your opinion based on personal experience and knowledge.","It is not uncommon for some youngsters to give up on university education due to either their preference to work or their incapability of affording the tuition of higher education. It is my view that young people should be encouraged to attend university if possible. Ċ The benefits that college education can yield for the young are truly overwhelming. The most significant one is that college students are able to acquire theoretical knowledge through taking a variety of lectures, which enables them to get a basic perspective of everything in life. This will be very helpful to youngsters' future life. Also, the campus life is generally regarded as a precious part of a person's life because college students develop maturity, independence and important abilities in university. Besides, young people can obtain degree or certificate after graduating from the college, which makes them more competitive in the modern society where the competition is increasingly stiff. Ċ On the other hand, some individuals argue that people can succeed even without university education. It is true that there exist some successful people who have not attended university or drop out of college. This can be best illustrated with the example of the great businessman Bill Gates, who, though dropping out of Harvard, has ever become the wealthiest person in the world. However, not everyone can become another bill gates. As an ordinary person, we would be well-advised to attend university to gain knowledge and skills as well as the degree and certificate that are still very essential for us to get a good job. Ċ My view is that university education is necessary to the young. I think it would be a great loss for us to miss the campus life. Therefore, young people who can afford to attend college should cherish this precious opportunity."
10107,"Some people say that schools should spend more money on computers, others say that more money should be spent on teachers' wages. Discuss both views and state your opinion.","With the advent of modern technology, schools have been superseding their manual methods of teaching with computers. Many experts opine that more money should be spent on computers rather than money spent on teacher's income. Personally, I am in consummate disaccord with the aforementioned notion and the following expository paragraphs will expatiate both the stances with lucid examples. Ċ On the one hand, the computer is considered to be an essential factor for expanding the horizon of student's knowledge. To elucidate, the profuse information present on the internet can be accessed with the help of computers that eventually, assists students to understand their subjects more immaculately.Nevertheless,in this prevailing competitive environment across the world, it is imperative to grasp as much as possible and develop the desired skills. To illustrate,the international news about the events happening across the globe can be fathomed by the usage of computers. As a result, it prepares the students for future challenges and the work environment. Ċ On the other hand, it is apparent that the teacher is a driving entity behind any kind of machine.In other words, the teacher is responsible for inculcating the right set of information and helps students to gain knowledge in a sagacious way. Every student would need a teacher and undoubtedly, teachers put diligent efforts to make their students more intellectual.For example, from the first standard to high school,it is a teacher who informs students about the perfect material to study online and also instils the required skills to operate the systems. Therefore, one cannot neglect these teachers in any way. Ċ To conclude, I reckon that there should be equilibrium maintained between the wages of teachers and the money invested in computers. Both are indispensable to create a synergy of the superlative education system that will create a better future for the students."
10108,How widely do you think the problem spreads that people Ċ spend too much time on work than their personal life and experience Ċ time shortage? What problems it cause?,"One of the most conspicuous trends of today's world is effecting personal life due to spending too much time at work in all over the world. There is a wide range of factors that account why this is happening. In my opinion, this situation can be remedied provided that some effective measures are taken. Ċ There are a myriad reasons of this soaring concern, unlike everyday problem, which can be dealt with easily, shortage of time, which is extremely perilous can lead to an array of issues as a relationship problem and growth of children. Thanks to the aforementioned predicaments, it can not only people, but also society can suffer immensely. For example, most of the companies put workloads on their employees with tight project deadlines. Therefore, in order to meet the deadline, they have to work late night. Ċ Steps to deal with this problem are many, but the most important is in fact not only remote and unexpected, but also accessible and practicable. The primary one stem from the facts that by ensuring implementation of fact and policies, government authorities can help a native thrive. Besides, international organization and local authorities should take all necessary initiative cumulatively. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see some considerable progress in curbing the issue. Ċ To conclude, dealing with work-life balance is one of the prevailing problems that faces people all over the world. Nevertheless, concrete steps discussed above can effectively strengthen the fight against and alleviate this growing issue. Its potential impact is indeed too dire to ignore."
10109,"ull title: Some people believe that robots are getting increasingly important in our lives. However, others think robots are extremely dangerous. What is your opinion? Why?","In today's modern life technology have contributed in people's lives in many ways. Especially robotic systems with artificial intelligence can perform many industrial duties and getting to be increasingly important for some people. However, there are those who think that robots have negative affect for people and can bring extreme danger in the future. These points of view must be addressed accordingly. Ċ Today, it has been proven, that robotic systems have benefited in many ways. For instance, few robots have helped children with developmental disabilities; others have improved the health status of people with different deficiencies. People who have experienced therapy robots in their lives have commented that robots brought confident in their lives as well as solved problems with their health. The other fact is that in some industrial countries robots are helping children with deficiencies to develop faster and have influenced positively to their behaviour. Ċ However, some people consider that robots may be extremely dangerous for people. One reason for this is that robots have artificial intelligent and they cannot replace human intelligent in solving different problems. For instance, few robots have started to operate in some hospitals and it is very dangerous for patients, as robots cannot be responsible for their action. Secondly, robots may pose the possible increase of unemployment in the future. This can be evidenced, as employers will choose robots' work force instead of human beings', because robots do not need any salary, moreover they will not complain or feel sick. Ċ After analyzing these two points of argument I think that robots should not replace human beings with doing different kind of jobs, because no machine can replace human intelligence as well as cannot be responsible for their action. Moreover production of high number of robots can increase unemployment rate in the countries."
10110,"Nowadays more and more people are using cellphones and computers to Ċ communicate, so they are losing the ability to communicate with each other face to face. To what extent do you agree or Ċ disagree with the statement?","Modern technology has revolutionized people’s ways of talking to each other Some people advocate that the wide use of high-tech messaging equipment namely cell phones and computers impairs an individual's ability for face-to-face communication. As far as I am concerned, the masses are likely to lose interpersonal skills in the real world if they get addicted to this communication method. Ċ Firstly, it is obvious that technology removes opportunities for real-world socialization. People today mainly rely on search engines like Google for information acquirement, instead of real people. Consequently, there are far less interpersonal communications in daily life such as question-and-answer conversations, discussion and arguments between students and teachers, between colleagues and even between children and parents. Ċ In addition, it is also recognized that communicating via cell phones and computers makes people deficient in face-to-face contact lies in the fact that it decreases the dimension of socialization. For example , the online conversation space is very narrow since the majority of messages exchanged in social networking like Facebook, Twitter and text are only on a simple verbal level. Therefore, other non-verbal levels of interpersonal skills such as body language and social psychology are totally invalid and then ignored, hence making people incompetent and unskilled when talking with others face to face. Furthermore, there is no denying that participants’ true sincerity and atmosphere between people when holding a conversation cannot be expected from a phone call or online chatting. Admittedly, a contract between firms cannot be signed without rounds of negotiations and bargains; a couple falling in love is by no means satisfied with voice calls. Ċ In conclusion, the separation between people is undeniable in terms of the fact that it eliminates the possibility of face-to-face and emotional communication as well as failure to train the practical interpersonal skills supposing that they excessively depend using these methods is highly detrimental to real-life discourse."
10111,"Prompt: Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised. Ċ International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support. Ċ Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth. Ċ In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary."
10112,Unemployment is one of the biggest problems of contemporary society. Ċ What do you think are the main causes of unemployment? Ċ What solutions can you suggest?,"Individuals are always seeking work to earn their livelihood. One of the major challenges faced in today’s world is unemployment. There are various aspects to this current situation. This essay will discuss further details on causes and put forward a few solutions to overcome this issue based on my view. Ċ To commence with, the main causes of being jobless are lack of skills and work opportunities. People often educate themselves in their academic field, however, neglect the fact that an organisation usually looks for individuals who are well-versed with expertise, such as technical skills. In addition to this, due to a larger number of people competing for relatively fewer spots available in the market may also be considered as one of the reasons associated with a high rate of unemployment. Ċ Furthermore, we might be able to resolve this concern in society by encouraging the eligible candidates to train themselves as per the requirement of a company before appearing for an interview. If a candidate is competent in the required area, there is a high probability of getting employed. Similarly, globalization has given us a chance to attain jobs all over the world. Advancement in society offers us to travel abroad and gain a career. For instance, if an individual is originally from India, he/she can apply for the desired occupation in Australia by sending an application through e-mail, and permanently migrating to pursue his/her career. Ċ In conclusion, although it is impossible to deny that the public is suffering from idleness without any means to provide for their families due to the absence of mastery and comparatively low options in the market, we can mitigate this issue by attending the required training to become proficient along with seeking opportunities across the world."
10113,Should old man live with young people together or should they live in the clubs for the elder? Discuss.,"Due to the improvement in living standard, life expectancy has substantially increased for recent years. As a result, nursing the elder is now a great concern not only of family but also the government. Some people argue that family members should directly take care of the elder while others believe that it will be better for them to participate in clubs for the elder. This essay will explore both views. Ċ People who support the former explain that no one can perform the role better than their relatives. This is because family members who are supposed to take responsibility of nursing the elder definitely know what their parents or grandparents need. in addition home is said to be the safest place to live as at that ages the thing they really need is the children's love. It is the fact that many young people suppose that they can make their relatives happy by supporting some money each month. However, no matter how good is the service is, it can not replace family feeling. Ċ on the other hand, others feel that they should live in caring service centers. What the supporters of this view contend is that because of the modern lifestyle, young people have less time with their parents. Consequently, they can not fulfill their responsibility. By letting them participate in clubs, they are served full service including diet, medicine and entertainment. Another advantage is that they have many friends what are at the same ages so that they can talk together, share stories and ideas. Ċ To conclude, in my view, no matter how hard the work is, young people should spend more time with their parents or grandparents who have raised them up even though they live in clubs for the elder. Obviously, at their ages material can be valueless without love."
10114,"In the last 20 years, there have been significant developments in the field of information technology IT ,for example, the world wide web and communication by E-mail.However,these developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive in the future . To what extent do you agree with this view?","Many people believe information technology is boon in the last two decades among other developments. Even, this has played as a vital aid for the communication to reform as a substitute method. In this essay, I will discuss the merits and demerits of IT and what I state my opinion. Ċ In the wake of the global access world, the modern method of being online has brought the automation in data's availability and many ways into the communication patterns. Additionally, this connects the people worldwide and educates the people for numerous know-how processes. Many people who live alone, and away from their family are felt to be disconnected. For instance, previously, migrants such as students, who reside in a new culture and new society, leaving their native place often feel homesick. The underlying reason was due to no connectivity of email or social media in past tradition. It was learned as a challenging issue limited with their sources and use of restricted technology. Nowadays, this has overcome with the solution of emails, video calling, social media websites etc. Ċ On the contrary, the negative impact comes when this is overly used by the people and physical appearance has been replaced with the electronic system. The human touch and convincing ability of emotional intelligence are driven by the mixer expressions in words. Additionally, it has provided an adverse impact on stealing the info by hackers of one's personal data. Thus, it has become vulnerable to use the essential data on the Computer device like passwords or GPS location-enabled applications. For instance, in many countries, children kidnapping has become a source of leaking data that is designed to locate one's personal clue with IP address and they get trapped in. Furthermore, it is the most negative side of this IT which is emerged as a source of crime and not deemed to be beneficial for the future purpose. Ċ To conclude above, any advance technique tends to bring both as positive and negative attributes to the system. It is more likely to be aware, how to include this as the automation for betterment, and less usage will anyway prevent unevenly use in losing the data and personal info."
10115,"QUESTION: Crime and conspiracy rates have been increasing through the years. Whistle blowers, who are accomplices to the crime, reveal information on who the principal suspects are, in return of immunity from any punishment. Others, however, argue that such people must also suffer the consequences and be put to jail just like any other criminal. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your reasons why.","ANSWER: Nowadays, people say that whistle blowers should be protected and others say that they should endure entire life in prison. Predominantly, I think they should be defended from danger but that does not mean they have full exemption from a criminal offense. Ċ Whistle blowers reveal a great value of information. These people have first hand details that can support a lawsuit thereby, making them vulnerable to potential harm from the opposition.They should be protected as they serve as a trump card of the case. Ċ In addition, these informants are vital to the resolution of a crisis. They want to expose themselves to correct a wrongdoing as they hope to stop the crime. Maybe, some conscience is still left with them thereby, wanting to correct their mistakes. Ċ Al though, these people want to have full grant on immunity from the law, I reckon that they should still be penalized. Maybe they can receive a minor punishment instead. It is still a fact that without these accomplices, crimes would not happen. It would be unfair if there would be a full immunity. Imagine it if every accomplice will try to volunteer to become a whistle blower, they may try to use this as an escape goat. Overall, this should be studied first and should depend on a case to case basis. Ċ To sum it up, I think having people like whistle blowers are of great importance and in return should be sheltered. Nonetheless, claiming full immunity is nonsense. I can accept though if their court sentences be lowered, these should be considered since, they can serve as a key to a major decision in court."
10116,"There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.","Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues. Ċ Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible. Ċ However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it. Ċ Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species. Ċ In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction."
10117,"When a new town is planned, it is more important to develop public parks and sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time in. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is said that when a new town is developed, public parks and sports facilities take priority over shopping malls. After analysing the environmental, health and economic factors at play, I will conclude that this statement is indeed, correct. Ċ Firstly, public parks provides greenery for local people, which is seriously lacking in modern city life. Despite this, there are usually not enough incentives for commercial developers to build these spaces, as they are normally free of charge, hence offering little profitability. Commercial and residential complexes, on the other hand, are lucrative investments, holding special allure for businesses. It is, therefore, incumbent on the government to plan public parks ahead of the development of a new town, or there would be too many apartment buildings, which may necessitate the authorities’ intervention. For example, the construction of many apartment buildings in my city, Hanoi, were forced to stop at the green space–population ratio of the area would have been below a healthy level. Ċ Sports facilities are another aspect of a new metropolis that local governments should prioritize. With obesity rising and even being put on political agendas in some countries, efforts are being made to discourage sedentary lifestyles while encouraging active ones. Sports facilities should thus become integrated in any residential area. In fact, I believe we need more of them and fewer shopping centres, as the former promote health and the latter may even have an opposite effect, being places that generally involve little physical activity and high consumption of food. Ċ Of course, I argue that there will be those who say shopping malls are needed if a township is to function properly. After all, we all need to go shopping for the sake of personal enjoyment and shared economic development. While this may be true to some extent, as demand rises, shops are bound to appear in a populated area anyway, with or without the planned support of governments, so it only makes sense to leave shopping centre development in the private sector. One may argue that parks and sports facilities can be commercialized too, but most residents view them as public assets that should be provided and paid for by the authorities, not themselves. Humans, for instance, balked and protested at the prospect of having to pay to get in the Thong Nhat park, one of our city’s major parks. Ċ In conclusion, I believe it is essential that public parks and sports facilities be included in urban planning. Shopping centres are also necessary, but should be left to commercial developers. Hopefully, in the future we will see more towns with balanced arrangements of public spaces and shopping areas."
10118,"The internet has brought about many changes into our day to day life. Nowadays we are Ċ doing things such as mailing, communication much faster. Do these developments have more advantages than disadvantages?","Nowadays, technology plays a vital role in our day to day life. The development of the internet has made communication much easier in comparison with earlier days. Although it has various advantages, there are few notable disadvantages tailored to it. In this essay, I will discuss both of these aspects with an explanation for each of them based on my personal experience. Ċ Firstly, modern-day technology is rapidly developing. The Internet has become the main source of communication in every industry. E-mails are one of the first developed means of interaction; however, the development of social networking has taken a whole new turn. It is of great advantage as these means of communication keeps people connected no matter from which part of the world. For instance, in the olden days, individuals had to write letters and post them, it took an average of one month for the other party to receive them. As a result, there were very few people who intended to keep in touch with their loved one's. Therefore, It is an undeniable fact that these advancements have made things much easier. Ċ Secondly, on the other hand, constant browsing and efforts to contact someone is setting people away from their own families and is challenging their social abilities. It is evident that most youngsters' are lacking social skills. For example, my nephew spends most of his time browsing and he hardly likes sports or physical activities. Though it might not seem like a big issue, I personally feel it plays a tremendous role in their near future. In such cases, it is the responsibility of their parents or guardians to encourage kids to explore the outside world by introducing them to camps, sports classes and community services. Having said that, it is impossible to completely eliminate the effects but regulations can be set to control them. Ċ To conclude, there are great advantages associated with it. If proper use of it is made, it can definitely overweight the disadvantages. Hence, I think the internet plays a crucial role in the present generation and surely makes life less complicated for humans."
10119,"Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.","Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons. Ċ The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that` a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia. Ċ Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem , not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate . Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. Ċ To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence."
10120,International travel makes people prejudiced rather than broad-minded. What are its causes and what measures should be taken to solve these problems?,"It is often said that universal travel creates the population norrow_minded instead of being broad_minded. There are multiple causes for this trend and there is much that can be done to tackle the problem constructively. Ċ Firstly ,one of the main causes is the culture of different publics around the world. For example ,people may travel to another country where they can not see the same culture such as clothing ,eating food and making conversation. Also ,most of the population on the globe habitually claim ,their own traditional culture is better than others. They commence imposing their beliefs on others. This would probably create many norrow_minded humans around the Earth in 21 century. Therefore ,this makes it clear there are conspicuous reasons for this issue that we can not escape from them. Ċ Secondly ,apart from these issues, humans have an opportunity to solve these problems. For instance ,one possible approach is merging into other cultures that we are seeing in countries where we travel. We all know all the population in the world have different beliefs and cultures. When humans decide to accept them the problem is tackled quickly. Another feasible approach is making conversation with other people to start understanding them. This would probably solve the trouble of this content. As a result ,it becomes apparent this is true that the problems are noticeable ,however, the communities could find a suitable solution for them. Ċ To summarise ,there is no denying that the troubles of this issue are numerous ,however, this is not a reason to avoid taking action. It is predicted that by putting diverse ideas via societies this will tackle effortlessly."
10121,"In some countries, younger people are neglecting their right to vote. Ċ What problems does this cause and what are some of the possible solutions","The usage of private transportation is tremendously increased owing to the development of technology.This essay elucidates the multifarious factors which attribute to these problems and the solutions to resolve it. Ċ The reliance on cars for commutation has elevated certainly. The fumes emitted from the vehicles cause a grave issue like air pollution, which is a threat to the environment. Not only that, it may lead to dreadful problems like respiratory disorders, asthma or lung diseases. Furthermore, it has paved a way for the rise of traffic congestion.Because of this issue, the transit time has increased significantly. For instance, people are spending more time on traffic signals and roads even though the distance to the destination is relatively short. Ċ On the contrary, we can combat these problems by following some effective measures. Government can provide some percentage of tax exemption for the people who commute by walk, bicycles, buses and trains. As a consequence, the usage of cars will drastically decrease. Can you imagine a city without cars? Though, it is highly impossible to avoid private transportation, it can be alleviated remarkably.New metro lines can be laid to connect all parts of the city. In addition to this, trains and buses should be maintained properly to offer a comfortable journey to the public. For example, air conditioned buses are introduced in metro cities have received appreciation from people. It will foster the individuals to prefer public conveyance over owned cars. Ċ To conclude, there are several unanticipated problems caused by over relying on the cars. But it can be mitigated by implementing effective measures by government."
10122,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship between people.Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"Telling truth has been a debatable issue among people from the past till now. Sometimes, there is a situation that people prefer to lie or hide the truth. They justify themselves that telling truth is not only appropriate and reasonable but it makes problem occasionally. Nevertheless something former is said, in my opinion, it is very important that people tell truth to each other in any relationship they have. Ċ To begin with, I believe in no lie between friends is very helpful to friendship. It is common among People tell some white lie to their friends avoid making them sad. They think that if they tell truth, their friends become upset and their friendship goes on ruin. For example, brad desires to be an actor but he has no gift in acting. His dream is not accordance to his talent. But his friends because of satisfying him tell him lie. They give him compliment. As a result, brad thinks that he acts excellently and can be a successful actor. He becomes ambitious and destroys his opportunities. Ċ Second, truth make people rely on each other. Believe or not, lie builds a wall of separation among people. For instance, in advertisement, if a company tells lie to people and promotes a product in a tricky way, after that people do not buy its product. This company obtains a negative reputation among people and goes to a wrong direction. Ċ In addition, it is everybody's right to know the truth. May be people hide truth to keep their friendships well, but their friends will know the truth eventually. After it happens, they blame them for not telling truth. Ċ Finally, it can be said telling truth has a significant role in any relationship between people. People with telling truth can rely on each other. This makes their relationships steady and secure."
10123,Essay Topic: Some children nowadays take sports seriously while others play sports in their free time. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples.,"In recent times, some children consider sports to be a mandatory activity in their daily routine while others neglect it to be an optional one. It is felt that young generation should treat sports to be a positive phenomenon. This will be shown by looking at how a child gets benefited from health and behavioural perspective getting involved various sports. Ċ Firstly, an outdoor sport demands a lot of physical activities that in turn help players to be fit and well built. So, the kids who get engaged in any such games are thought to possess good health. For example, youngsters who play rugby regularly, stay far away from obesity problems. Thus, this example makes it clear how sports assist children to maintain fitness. Ċ In addition to this, many team sports teach the players the art of delivering unitedly. When people start participating in such sports from younger age, they learn how to perform best in collaboration with other team members and this acquired skill later on help to prove themselves as efficient team members. For instance, game like soccer where coordination with other players is important for winning, gives lessons to acquire team skills. Thus, there are merits to encourage children to get involved actively in sports. Ċ It can be concluded that children who are inspired to take sport seriously are at an advantageous position than those who do not. It is recommended that sports schools should take an active role to make the students aware of the benefits of sports."
10124,"Some people think that the government should strictly control the supply of fresh water, as the resources are limited. While others think we can use as much as we want. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Water is an utmost important natural resource gifted by nature to humankind. While a few people think that freshwater consumption to be controlled with stringent rules by the government, others think that it should be available for people as much as they wanted to use. In this essay, I will discuss both views in detail and provide my supporting examples to prove the former statement takes precedence. Ċ There are two reasons for the supporters to believe that freshwater availability should be abundant for the common people. First of all, freshwater is the basic necessity for humans for daily activities and to be provided free of cost. Different purposes, for instance, like drinking, washing clothes, bathing, etcetera are the minimum amenities for every individual, without which they cannot survive. Adding to this, they feel that governments should make sure the rainwater harvesting pits to be constructed at required places to increase groundwater availability during the rainy season. The average rainfall recorded in India, for instance, during the last academic year was 76% which is way higher than the previous years, but could not be stored by governments due to the lack of storage bodies. Ċ On the contrary, the others, including me, think that strong policies should govern people in the right direction to use water in a limited way to save it for future generations. Due to the lack of proper ,governance pure water facilities are enjoyed by only the richer communities, leaving the poor people in thrust. Many independent gated communities, for example, are never bothered about it, as they are consuming 77% of water in Hyderabad city as per the statistics of the renowned News channel. Apart from this, the misconsumption of this natural resource is another reason for this phenomenon. Many resorts and hotels, for instance, are using Millions of Gallons in games and swimming pools for recreation and entertainment purposes. Ċ In conclusion, many people think that freshwater delivery to be controlled by the government policies, while others think that they should not charge any amount to use it. I completely opine that local government should closely monitor its usage as it is the basic necessity for everyone and to be shared between poor and rich with equality."
10125,Some people say that too much time and resources are spent on the protection of wild animals and birds. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today's world, many species of wild fauna are endangered or on the brink of extinction. It is believed by some that humans are spending excessive amounts of resources and time on protecting these wild species. In this essay, I will explain why I disagree with this opinion as wildlife is important for the environmental balance and it is our moral duty to protect it. Ċ To begin with, wild animals and birds should be protected as they are a crucial part of the ecosystem. Earth's ecosystem is dependent on all these different living beings in various ways such as the food chain. For instance, birds such as owls and eagles usually eat rodents like rats which in turn help in keeping the population of rats in control. If such birds of prey become extinct, human farms would be infested by these pests which might lead to a shortage of food. Thus, it is crucial to conserve wildlife to keep the environment stable. Ċ Moreover, it is a moral duty of people to help conserve these wild species as they have an equal right to stay on this planet. The wild fauna is endangered in the first place because of the exploitation of wild habitats by humans. For example, human practices such as deforestation and poaching have dislocated and killed many animals and birds over the years. Therefore, it is the responsibility of mankind to restore and make up for these destructive practices by conserving and rehabilitating wildlife. Ċ In conclusion, I absolutely disagree, that too much time and money is spent on the conservation of wildlife as it is important to protect it to maintain a balance in the ecosystem and it is the duty of humans to protect these birds and animals. In fact, more efforts should be put by governments into wildlife conservation."
10126,More and more people do not ride the bicycle as a mode of transportation even though it has a lot of benefits. Causes and solutions.,"Nowaday,there are so many kinds of modern transport in the social community.It is obvious that the citizen are using less bicycle than they used to do in the past.There are several reasons for this trend and important solutions for this case. Ċ At first,the major cause is the more and more popular appearance of cars and motorbikes are taking place the role of cycling,one of the basic private vehicle.People are getting more interested in machine than using their own foots.The second idea for the reason,why bikes are disappear,is the danger in traffic.As can be seen that controling low speed vehicles in order to enter the busy roads,which completely full of fast transports,for instance,trucks and cars,is too dangerous for the user.If the accident happen,it will be very serious damage. Ċ Nevertheless,it is not impossible to make the bicycle be more popular for the human again.Firstly,the government ought to create more necessary law to encourage the change in the people 's behaviors,particularly replacing the system using unrenewable source by renewable source one.Secondly,parents need to teach their children about protecting environment.Futhermore,children and youngster are the new generations of every countries and they need strong health to grow up so cycling is the most powerful habit.They also need to know how modern the other vehicles are,bikes still play a crucial role in life. Ċ In conclusion,Although bicycles are being forgotten, it still is possible to encourage more people enjoy travelling by bike and make it more popular in the society."
10127,"In order to improve a country's education system, young students should be allowed to openly criticize their teachers during class time. What is your opinion? What are some other ways education systems could be improved? how to improve teaching methods","There is no doubt that education system has an important role in the development of a country, hence, it should be kept improving. Receiving feedback from students is one of the best way to enhance the education system. However, I am against the idea that young students should be allowed to openly criticize their teachers during the class time. This could lead to unwanted consequences and we should consider other way to transform the classroom environment for the better result. Ċ First of all, allowing children to criticize their teacher in the class might affect the quality of the lesson. For example, criticism from the students might take considerable time for studying and learning objectives of that lesson might not be reached in such limited time. Other students who might not be interested in the subject would lose their attention for the lesson. Hence, this notion though innovative but not very much applicable in a normal classroom. Ċ Besides, in order to improve the quality of education system, we could extend the time of a normal lesson. This time should be used only to receive students opinions and queries, either in the means of feedback form or conversation. This way, the teacher would be able to understand the students confusion and response immediately or privately if necessary. This solution would give students a chance to raise their voice without wasting the time of the class. Ċ In conclusion, letting the teachers be freely critisized is not an effective way to improve teaching. Instead, we should have a separate time right after the lesson for students to raise their opinions. I believe this is a way to ensure the amount of knowledge taken in in a lesson and still, improve the education system."
10128,"The following topic is from one website which is for practicing IELTS writtings Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. Discuss this view and give your own opinion. exams and performance evaluation at school","Everyone knows that most of examinations for certificates or tests in school are all done by pen and papers. However, I side with the view that to carry out the examinations which focus on professional practices is more important. Ċ Educational achievement is an essential step for the way to a workplace, so some tests is a proof of the experience in school and can show how much efforts you did for studying. Furthermore, the purpose of examinations in school is to make students acquire what they learn. Pen and paper examinations can not completely work it for the effect of learning because it is better to solve some solutions by actions and practices, not merely get the view or concept of knowledge. Learning needs doing by yourself, so that you can really get it. Ċ While others are against of my view, contending that only pen and paper examinations can evaluate the capabilities of students for specific tasks or subjects. It is evident that the scores show the degree and level of examinees and that's their ability. It is true that the more scores you get, the more your level is. However, scores can lie sometimes. Answers can be filled in by guessing, cribbing or any improper ways. Only practices and applications can really show examinees know about solutions and how well they can do. Ċ Overall, I firmly conceive that pen and paper examination is not the best approach to assess educational achievement."
10129,Question:-  Newspapers have an enormous influence on people's opinions and ideas. Why is it? Do you think it is a positive or a negative situation? people's thoughts are affected by newspapers,"Answer:- The newspapers have a strong effect on an individual's viewpoint and ideas.There are various reasons behind this positive trend. Ċ The main reason for a profound influence of newspapers on the opinions of people is that these have become an essential part of most of the people's daily life.Every morning many people like to read a newspaper to know about the current affairs and latest news , local, national or international. This keeps them aware of even the social issues prevalent in the society which makes them sentimental and sensitive. Although this is possible through TV and the internet also, but because majority of people are habitual of reading a newspaper daily rather than using TV or the internet as a source of news, this printed media is far more influential. Ċ In my opinion, this kind of impact of newspaper in forming people's opinions is beneficial. When the newspaper editors print the true news of any issue in the newspaper, the readers can form a right opinion about the people. In other words, the news about scandals or scams can inform the public about the deceptive people who are part of it. There have been many bribery scandals by political leaders and when such incidents are read by the readers in the newspaper, they easily come to know that the leader is corrupt and should not be trusted. Ċ In conclusion, people's thoughts are affected strongly by the newspapers because they read it daily and this situation is beneficial for them."
10130,The government should allocate more funding to teach science rather than other subjects in order for a country to develop and progress. To what extent do you agree?,"Education acts as a fundamental to the progress of a nation, community and an individual. The subjects involved express the trend of job opportunities in the field to some extent. However, I believe that every subject is equally important. Hence, the funding should be well distributed and not just focussed on science. Ċ To commence with, the subjects such as arts, physical education, literature etc., are equally important for the all round development of a kid. For example, performing arts such as painting, dancing etc., can be soothing for many because they decrease stress. Similarly, physical education teaches us some yoga poses, healthy eating habits, sports etc., which increases the physical activities and make a person fit. All these subjects deserve grants so that any student who wants to pursue them as a career does not face any difficulties. Ċ On the other hand, science and technology needs more public grants so that scientists, researchers can perform their experiments. If these experiments are successful, then this earns the country fame worldwide. Some of these inventions may reduce the existing costs of production. This creates a positive influence and, thereby, improving investments from the other countries. Secondly, this sector generates more jobs every year, which helps a country to grow. The investments in the sciences, will make students more equipped for these jobs and thus, decreasing the unemployment. As an example, the IT sector generates most of the jobs in India every year. Ċ To conclude, I think that there is no doubt that the investment in the science is very important for any nation to make progress as it generates jobs and creates a positive influence in the world. However, I do believe that the other subjects need equal attention while funding."
10131,A lot of social problems can be related to teenagers these days. Some feel that this is because parents are not able to spend enough time to take care of their teenage child. Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, many social issues link to young adults. Some people claim that the main reason for this is parents are not looking after their children properly. However, I partially agree with the above statement and throughout this essay, I will explain it in detail. Ċ On the one hand, when parents do not have much time to keep eye on their children they have massive freedom and it can lead them to do unwanted things. To explain more, some adults have no idea what their teenagers doing with modern technology. There is various way to get involved with unnecessary websites and it could mislead them to use drugs or smoking activities. For example, my cousin uncle's 13-year-old son addicted to drugs at a very young age and doctors said that it because he had enough freedom and mother and father could not keep eye on him. Hence, it is certain that a lack of attention from adults can be related to children's social issues. Ċ On the other hand, social status is one more possible factor that could cause this issue. To clear up, the environment we raise our young generation also matters such as your neighbourhood, school mates and relatives. If youngsters growing up with an environment which is full of violence, bullying and harassment it could affect their future. For instance, my neighbour’s teenager was bullied at school and due to the impact of bad habits later on he becomes one of them. Thus, teen adult's community issues can link to the surround that they grew up. Ċ To sum up, lack of parent's attention and the social environment can cause social issues related to young adults."
10132,"It is thought by some that a school teachers role is to motivate and inspire students. However, other people believe that a teachers primary role is to pass on knowledge . What do you think is the role of a teacher?","School lecturers play a very important role in students motivation and the drive to learn. It is considered by many that sharing their understanding is the only job required from tutors to school pupils. However, I strongly believe that albeit one of the key functions of teachers is passing knowledge, there are still various other duties required from students to help them become whatever they want to in the future. The essential task of an educator is to assist a schooler in all aspects possible. Ċ Firstly, educating is the major factor for creating schools, hence the task of all instructors is to teach learners whatever syllable given to them. Nevertheless, different students don't assimilate the same. Some need close monitoring and additional care for them to understand what they are being taught. For instance, studies affirm that academic professors that communicate and interact amiably with scholars influence them positively to aim to learn and be productive. Ċ Furthermore, some children studying might be going through social or psychological problems that deter them from participating in class effectively. For example, bullying or family issues can affect a pupil mentally consequently resulting in low grades. One of the responsibilities of a classroom teacher is to observe changes in each student behaviour and find solutions either by talking to them personally or recommending a therapist. Ċ In conclusion, it is true that the required work of a lecturer is giving information. Moreover, there are other methods that can help learners acquire their dreams and gain crucial skills for development."
10133,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Advertising can tell you a lot about a country. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"Advertisements is used for marketing any products and services, it's a wide - spread marketing concept diligently fallowed by global market. This method of preluding products also reflects the various trend prevailing in a local market of the country, thusly advertisement contribute to acknowledge populace about any country. Ċ Every country has different format and pattern liked by their local public as such companies are bound to consider various aspect while designing advertisement. Seller consider aspects like taste, fashion, current trend, preference, demand, and financial capability of their consumers that precipitates an easy expectancy of their product in the market. On the bases of content and design of advertisement at least one can have idea about the preference of people, glimpse of their culture, mentality of people and language prevailed in the country. Ċ I was viewing an India channel, I have perceived their facial cream product add claiming themselves best for whitening the skin. By viewing the model in the advertisement and by whitening feature, I analyzed that people of India probably has warmer skin tone. Likewise in the America, I have noticed almost all edibles add promoting myriad range of non- vegetarian food item, consolidating that I concluded that American people are more inclined towards non - vegetarian food. Advertisement did helped one to have an idea about countries. Ċ Geographically the advertisements methods and its substance differ reflecting the prevailing style and like and dislike of people as well highlighting superficial knowledge about any country."
10134,Young people say that travelling to different countries benefits them and the society. Do you agree or disagree. Give your opinion.,"Most youth contends that foreign tours are extremely beneficial for the public and community. There are certain pros and cons of this phenomenon and I will discuss them in the next few paragraphs. But I believe that the positives of tourism are far more than the negatives. Ċ To begin with, there are a few drawbacks to travelling. When students visit other countries, they waste their valuable time which has devastating impacts on their studies. For instance, if young learners of an institute go on a recreational tour to remote places, they could not study their books during that period. Moreover, some students don't respect the local traditions of visiting places because their minds are still immature. That is why this can create awkward situations sometimes and local people would ban outsiders. Ċ On the contrary, there are enormous advantages of the world tour. First and foremost, tourism is incredibly important for the grooming of adolescents, as they learn multiple things about other cultures and locations. For example, if the pupils of the geography department of a university go to different geographically important places, they will automatically learn several facts. Secondly, it also enhances the intercultural interactions that lead to harmony among people of diverse ethnic backgrounds. It could decline racial and religious discrimination that would prevent dangerous conflicts amongst civilizations. Ċ In conclusion, I think that even though travelling abroad can affect the academic performance of youngsters, their personal grooming and harmonious effects on society are beyond the imagination. It is the need of the hour to maintain the delicate balance between amusement and education activities."
10135,University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the Internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of the Internet in formal education is a good idea? What future effects will the Internet have on academic study?,"Nowadays, sharing lectures on the Internet is very helpful not only because graduates can read them online and study at home but also because they can read them how many times they want to. Ċ On the one hand, there are some disadvantages about uploading lectures on the Internet. Visiting university make students more responsible and independent. They have timetable and should follow it, while, for example, graduates who study at home wake up later in the morning than those who attending university. Also, scientists believe that everybody memorize information much better if they heard it from lecturer, instead of reading it online. However, visiting university is harder than studying at home, but students can ask their lecturers some questions and get quick answer, while using google engine to search for them will take more time. Ċ On the other hand, positive aspects are more significant than negative ones. Firstly and most importantly, everybody can try to attend university and study at home at the same time. Then it will be easier for students to get their exams. Secondly, they can search for data in Google that their lecturers did not know or just study more about the lecture online. This can only help them to prepare for their tests. Thirdly, some students forget very quickly and it is better for them to read lectures every day. Ċ In conclusion, I am inclined to think that using Internet for uploading data and lectures is beneficial and advantages of it outweigh disadvantages."
10136,Team activities can teach more skills for life than those activities which are played Ċ alone. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the contemporary era, globalization is affecting every aspect of life. A coterie of the masses thinks that cooperating as a team will benefit individuals in the future while others believe that accomplishing tasks isolatedly has much better potentials. From my perspective, team-building activities surely will be good foundations for further developments. Ċ It is undeniable that working as a group is the origin of many advantages. Firstly, overcoming challenges by cooperating with people make individuals be more open-minded, self-controlled and sympathetic. Thus, these will be important attributes for recruitments in the future; moreover, employees with such soft skills will be more respected and prioritized for promotions. For instance, employers will completely be more captivated by employees who perform more productively while working in a group than workers who isolatedly do the tasks quietly and boringly. Achieving goals with other people is a process that edifies every human to be more well-roundedly developed. Ċ On the other hand, activities being manufactured alone are bringing about numerous drawbacks. These exhort people to rely on themselves which will paramountly cause individuals not to trust other co-workers. Therefore, they will be slowly but steadily introverted and badly depressed. Eventually, this will inhibit workers to be as productive as usual. In addition, working all alone thwarts people from being amicable and makes them excessively praise individualism. Hence, this will be a serious detriment for people's future careers. Overcoming challenges individually is nothing but an impairment that prevents humans from for example being compatible with the world which is tremendously affected by globalization. Ċ In conclusion, collaborating with a group of people appears to be a better method to train individuals since it is more pragmatic to the world's circumstances. Companies should focus more on enhancing employees team-working manoeuvres in order to flourish in a globalized world."
10137,Topic: Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for child's education than going to school. But others believe that school teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"No one can deny the importance of computers and the Internet for children during their study progress. Although these means bring to users a large number of advantages, I believe that learning at school and interacting with teachers are much more vital for children's learning. Ċ It is true that students can get a variety of benefits from using successfully computers and the Internet. To begin with, the Internet is the endless source of knowledge including all areas namely science, literature, math, etc. With solely simple movements, users can easily get all needed information and use time to full potential. In addition to this, the Internet is the global forum for all people around the world to share thoughts, exchange ideas and gain experience from others. Starting with one question, people can get lots of answers which can be accurate or not. Ċ Despite the above arguments, I still stand on the belief that teachers are much more essential than computers or the Internet for the promotion in study of children. The first issue is that teachers are able to not only give them the vast knowledge but also direct them thoroughly how to face difficulties and to become good citizens. Another point is that lecturers in schools always observe clearly their students' learning process so that learners can handle problems with the assistance of their teachers. Finally, teachers often give only one exact answer for such a question, which is different from the numerous equivocal responses we could get on the Internet. Ċ To sum up, a computer equipped with the Internet is one of the greatest inventions for human beings in discovering this amazing world. However, it cannot take place the importance of school teachers to children. This is the reason why we still keep going to classes for learning and just use computers as an effective study device."
10138,"Some people believe that unemployed people should be made to work for their welfare/benefit payments. Others, however, see this as cheap labour. Discuss the possible advantages and disadvantages of making unemployed people take any job. Do you believe that making unemployed people work is a good idea?","Some citizens make an assumption that the people which do not have an occupation should be made to work for obtaining some benefits as if they apply for a job it will decreasing te poverty numbers since they found an appropriate job which provided by the government. However, the people health percentage also show a dramatic decrease because they should work the most of their time and forget to take a rest. Ċ Such a massive transformation about people being more industrious and obtaining some abilities with their job. Due to the fact that they insist themselves for working much more a long time in work venue. In the 2014 recent University of Indonesia disclosed that 50% of Jakarta population which does not have labour have being occupant which has the ambition to broaden their horizon and therefore some of them become richer than others and also more diligent for collecting fund. Ċ Apart from the previous discussion, it also brings drawback for several societies, such as the quality of people's health percentages will be predicted decrease dramatically as they ignore to take a rest for rejuvenating their body and mind. In 2015 the novel Oxford University research revealed that 35% of Britain population have become much more vulnerable to prevent the virus as they forgot to keep their health and therefore some of them will become poor as they should spend the great number of money to hospitalize more often than others. Ċ In conclusion, I am more likely to believe that gaining any jobs are pivotal aspect due the fact that the people need money to continue their entire life. However, it also brings advantage and disadvantage and thinking twice before do your decision."
10139,"In most successful companies, some people think that communicaton between employers Ċ and workers is the most important factor. Other people say that other factors are more Ċ important. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.","A company is successful for various reasons which are collectively working towards the success of the goal. Among the reasons, many people think communication between top-down or vice-versa impact the most while others think the factors like finance, operation and innovation in working process are more important. In my opinion, if effective communication is done throughout every layer of the company, other factors will work simultaneously. Ċ To begin with, a success of a company is the result of a combination of several factors. Firstly, the company should have a clear roadmap to reach the destination of the end goal. For example, studies have shown that many startups, without having a clear goal the entrepreneurs give up the venture due to the inability to fight amid difficulties for which they might not have been prepared at the beginning since they did not make any long term roadmap. Secondly, the company should have a financial basement to deal with all costs, ranging from employees salaries, raw materials and machinery. Finally, to be sustainable in the competitive market, an organisation needs to expose innovation to its consumers. That novelty will attract new customers and ultimately increase the portfolio. Ċ Apart from all the factors discussed above, the link among the employees who will actually accomplish everything is a significant factor. If the information flow is clear from top to down and down to top it will work like blood circulation into the vein. And how far the circulation of information is smooth, the company will develop further. For instance, If the top employee asks field employees, who are directly dealing with the consumers, about the real queries about how the product is performing, they can have a crystal view of the overall picture about the preference of the end-users, pricing reaction and future demand of the venture. Moreover, the easy information flow gives greater motivation to the workers, that they do not hold any fear about losing a job which ultimately leads them to provide the best effort according to management goal. Ċ In conclusion, although many factors are responsible for the achievement of the success of the company, communication from top to down contribute the most towards the goal. So, if the employers behave positively to the worker, the company is far more closer to success."
10140,"school take time from children In many countries, children are spending several hours each evening doing homework. Should children be given homework?","Educational students are really important for their entire life so the ways to teach are also extremely important.In many nations, young people are spending a lot of ò hours every night studying at home.This method has many dí advantages and some advantages. Ċ First of all, Doing homework in several hours each evening í wasting time and harming brain by many reasons.First, Relaxing state, which is the best state to study and easy to get the highest productivity,cannot receive by studying a long time without relaxing.Next, emotions are the core to keep living will be lost by trying to study during days.Task Satisfaction, which keeps people feel happy during holde life os very hard to figure due to spending a lot of time for homework, which doesn't mean everything with young people's future.Childhood is the beautiful time in the life so if students use it just for studying it is going to be the worst rue when they grow up. Ċ Second of all, Homeworks are important as many causes. Firstly,Theories, which students learn from schools, need to practice to be achieved. self-study, which is really important for life, can be built by doing homework. Stability, which is important characteristics, is prating while doing homework during hours. Ċ To sum up, Doing homework is important, however, we should spend enough not too much time for it to get all benefits and avoid failures."
10141,Teenagers should never be put in the same prison with adults no matter how serious their crime is. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?,"Nowadays, youngsters are getting involved with various crimes in society which warrants a jail term. It has been suggested that they should not be kept with the grown-ups for specific reasons, and I agree entirely with the opinion. This essay will discuss why these two groups should be separated in jail. Ċ For several reasons, teenagers should not be confined in the same place as the adults in a correction cell. Firstly, when older inmates are locked with the younger ones, they tend to feel a sense of superiority, and their abusive nature can be switched on, which might lead the youths to get abused and assaulted, for example, in Nigeria, where a nineteen years old boy was beaten to coma by oldsters in the same place for refusing to wash their clothes. Moreover, some of them ended up getting molested sexually, which would not have happened if they were kept separate. Ċ Furthermore, a lot of adolescents may come along with behavioural problems if they were allowed to stay with people above their age group. Some may end up picking bad habits, learn antisocial behaviours, develop an attraction towards thrilling life stories of the seniors, and may even come out from custodial worse than how they went into it. For instance, studies in the past decade have revealed that about 70% of the youths who were convicted came out worse than before going to jail; thus, society continues to suffer. Additionally, some of them have also reported being enticed by these persons into engaging in practices such as smoking. Ċ In conclusion, at least to not make the situation worse, I think it is safer and wiser for prisons to have different cells for adults and youths."
10142,It is generally accepted that families are not as close as they used to be. Give reasons why this change has happened and suggest how families could be brought closer together?,"Nowadays, the family connection is not considered to be the most important aspect of life ,especially in the younger generation. Several factors are believed to be responsible for this issue such as resentment between generations due to different points of view, miscommunication, etc. However, this problem is not too late to solve with the right approach which will be discussed in the following essay. Ċ First of all, it is undeniable that age difference plays a crucial role in family relationships. Evidently, the majority of parents in the present time belongs to Millennials or Generation X who prefer a sense of security including stable jobs, unchanged schedules and likely maintain old traditions or stereotypes that they were taught when they were young. Meanwhile, offsprings in this era are more flexible to new possibilities and capable of thinking outside the box due to the influence of the internet which allows them to explore new ideas from across the globe. For illustration, an idea of same-sex marriage may seem weird for older adults as it does not fit with their beliefs and stereotypes while juveniles see this as a freedom of choice. Hence, the communication method is also various as most offsprings tend to be more straightforward than adults which elders consider as rude to them. For example, elders usually just do what they are told to do whether they like it or not but for juveniles is the opposite. Ċ In order to ease the problem, mutual respect and open communication between children and parents are needed to bring closer together. Likewise, it takes equal effort from both sides for sustainable solutions. For instance, families who are open for discussion from every household member are found to have better relationships according to numerous researches. Evidently, it allows members to know each other ideas and find common ground by talking about individual likes and dislikes. Furthermore, respect toward one another is the foundation for a healthy relationship. Therefore, children's opinions should not be neglected despite their lack of experience. Even though their lack life experiences, they are full of fresh ideas and do not fear to try new things. it is important that family encourage curiosity to promote confidence in oneself, creative thinking and trust from children to seek advice without feeling being judged. Ċ In conclusion, different attitudes toward life and poor communication are the primary cause of this situation. Consequently, consistent discussion within the household without judging each other is essential to support the trust and understanding in the family."
10143,"Many university students live with their families, while others live away from home because their universities are in different places. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both situations?","Many students enjoy living with their parents even when going to university, while others prefer moving out and living near their schools. I believe both options have their benefits and drawbacks. Ċ On the one hand, some individuals choose to stay with family for one primary reason. These could devote quality time to their study and acquire a good grasp of specialised knowledge because they are free of distractions associated with financial problems, such as the rent for accommodation. However, the major disadvantage of this choice is that living in their comfort zones would not provide them opportunities to gain practical skills, which would stand them in good stead in later life. In many Asian countries, employers often complain about their new workers who do not have any working experience and soft skills. Ċ On the other hand, numerous students are in favour of living away from home due to the studying environment they can enjoy while staying with classmates or roommates. Moreover, during this period, youngsters would encounter many hardships and find a way to tackle the vicissitudes of life. Nevertheless, these individuals may be concerned about their financial issues, so they spent time working as waiters, deliverers, which divert their attention away from the study. For example, in Vietnam, many young adults start to work while in university, then fall behind with their studies, leading to dropping out of college, which is a waste of time and money. Ċ In conclusion, each of these opinions has its own positive and negative aspects, students and parents should take into consideration and plan properly before making a decision."
10144,"TOPIC: ""Some people believe that time spent on television, video and computer games can be beneficial to children. Others believe this has negative effects on a child."" future generations in the 4.0 era","Nowadays, the massive development of the media has made a great contribution to society, which includes edfuture generations in the 4.0 erawever, whether studying on television, video and computer games can bring more benefits than negative effects is a controversial issue. I believe that we should make the most of those materials to support children to study better. Ċ First, it is true that the information resource from the Internet is enormous and in every domain in life. This means that there is no obstacle for pupils to discover the world around and fill up their minds with just a computer or a television. The lessons applied the progressive technology allow students to visualize lively and experience in the most practical ways. For example, with the presence of 3-D technology, parents now are able to bring a Jurassic world with all types of dinosaurs into their child's room. Therefore, the media is an essential tool that plays a critical role in schools. Ċ Those who harbor the view that the Internet, television and computer games negatively affect their children are partly right. These days, many adolescents are addicted to playing online games and gradually drifting away from the society outside. Moreover, the world on the Internet is also very sophisticated that the learners may neglect the study purpose to sink themselves into the virtual experience. This, notwithstanding, can be circumscribed if youngsters are guided to utilize the Internet properly by not only the teachers but their parents. Thus, in spite of the potential risks, the pros still outweigh the cons. Ċ In conclusion, what schools and families should do is to get technology involved in education programs of future generations in the 4.0 era. Simultaneously, it is crucial to supervise the activities of children in order to ensure that they do not misuse the media."
10145,Forests are the lungs of the earth. Destruction of the world’s forests amounts to death of the world we currently know. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is common knowledge that the earth breathing with the help of green areas. By cutting trees out from the entire world it would change beyond recognition. I strongly agree with this statement, because, if the ground doesn’t have plants on it, that may cause the desert formation and higher level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Ċ To begin, in places where the forest was destructed it is more likely to see the desert a few years later. In other words, trees are a protection system for the earth from natural phenomena such as rain, sun lights, wind, furthermore, owing to trees’ roots the ground condition is always in a balanced condition of humid-dryness. However, if deforestation is observed, then strong wind and sunlight will cause dry out of the land. For example, in Armenia, people used forest sources inappropriately, furthermore, they cut trees without any planting of new ones. As a result, a huge area of the country turned out to dryland. Ċ Another issue is that without the greenhouse a level of air pollution would increase even rapidly. Due to industrialization and globalization, the modern world produces a vast amount of waste not only contaminating rivers and the earth but also the atmosphere. Fortunately, trees have the ability to absorb carbon dioxide that enhances air purity. Recent research shows that for the last fifty years the felling of threes had risen dramatically in many countries such as Russia, Mongolia, the US, in addition, it was shown that proportion of pollutant growing as well. Ċ In conclusion, our planet has its own lungs that are forest. By their destruction, it would begin an irreversible process of harmful changes. I firmly agree, owing to the earth’s drying and inferior of the air purity without forests."
10146,"The pandemic situation emerges worlwide and Uzbekistan may face different risks in different fields. As Uzbekistan education system has been transferred to distance learning, the attitude of students may change towards the education. What is your opinion about this phenomenon? Give your opinion with examples.","Quarantine measures nowadays require different countries such as Uzbekistan to separate students from face-to-face classes and do them online. Hence, there are some risks according to this situation as the quality of education may be lower. Ċ Generally, the global pandemic extends to almost all fields besides education. It covers amusement, healthcare, production industry e.g. and equally affects them. However, schools and universities are likely to have more complications coping with the consequences we face at the moment as there are some aspects that illustrate it: poor quality and cover of the internet, lack of highly-educated staff that can adapt to distance teaching as well as living conditions of the population of Uzbekistan giving no opportunities to afford proper distance-study devices. I truly believe that these circumstances do not only enable pupils to obtain knowledge but also demoralises them. Ċ Another issue is that online classes are way inefficient than in-person ones. The reason is people mostly feel inconvenient attaining online as I can remember myself hesitating to ask for additional information about the new topic during this. Even though we can overlook this thing, there is another. For example, most of the students may not conceive full information about crucial aspects of the topic and it can commonly wind up with misunderstanding between them and their teacher as it is pretty challenging to state a clear case on the online platform where it is impossible to use body language to direct someone to your very aim. Ċ To conclude, even if there were perfect conditions to study online, an informal atmosphere and additional ways to interact with an instructor is able to lead to detrimental outcomes for either student or teacher."
10147,"Some people think that government should ban dangerous sports, such as sky diving and rock climbing.Do you agree or disagree?","A vast majority of people believe that regime should ban sports which are lethal for the individuals, such as bungee jumping, mountain climbing.This essay disagrees with the given perspective because these are adventurous games and furthermore, provide courage to overcome the phobia of height, water. Ċ To commence with, there are lots of thrill and adventure associated with dangerous sports activities.Since our youth has innate desire to explore the world, and want to experience all the dangers, therefore they indulge themselves in the games which can even prove fatal.For instance, a recent study reveals that these days popularity of sports which may even result in physical disabilities, has increased about 80 percent more in comparison to the past because of thrilling and exciting experience.This way people often take part in such activities in order to face the dangers of life. Ċ However, there is one advantage of these sports despite the dangers involved.If an individual takes participation in any of the lethal activities, such as river rafting, scuba diving, and many more, then they will be able to come out of the fear of altitude, water.To cite an example, there are lots of famous celebrities who were initially not able to cope up with the risks of life like Paragliding, but they achieved victory over their terrifying dreams.To elucidate, although these sports are in association with risks, help in overcoming certain thunders of the life. Ċ In conclusion, while it is true that sports such as rock climbing have danger inextricably linked with them, the government should not ban these.I think that these games act as a wonderful recreational activity for the youngsters as well as instills a feeling of courage and dedication in them.It would be wise to put some restrictions, but complete abolishment is not appropriate."
10148,"Write about the following topic. Ċ In the past, most people spent their entire career working for one company, whereas people nowadays move from one job to another. Ċ What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Which do you think is better? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.","Previously, the dominant culture about jobs was to choose a singular place throughout life compared to these days where people in most cases are swinging from one job to another. From my perspective, I think changing workplaces is a positive trend although it has sometimes a huge risk. So in the upcoming paragraph, I'm going to light the pros and cons of each. Ċ Generally, years ago individuals preferred to stick to a singular career at one spot for their whole life because of two main reasons. the first is having a stable income which ensures that there is an amount of cash they are going to receive at the end of every month. the second why was triggered by the sense of loyalty which was a value for folks at that time. For example, if someone chose to change his career path in past, he would end up unemployed because of the scarcity of opportunity 30 or 40 years ago. However, the routine is the main cons of being at the same work until retirement which is deprive these persons of broadening their thinking. Ċ On the other hand, current generations are trying as many jobs as possible and this is stem from the variety of works and opportunities nowadays. in other words, the abundance of firms is creating dozen of jobs with different ranges of salary. Therefore, individuals are aiming to increase their salary by changing the workplace whenever is possible. For instance, it is common nowadays that human resources departments send offers elsewhere with a few dollars rise to attract persons who are employed in other companies. In contrast, there is a sort of risk of changing careers frequently for people who rely on the monthly paycheck which thaغ may end up without any source of money. Ċ In conclusion, stable living condition with a sense of loyalty is the pros for grasping one job entire workforce age while routine is the main drawback of this behaviour. for those who are able to change their workplaces, the huge of companies that are open these days is the trigger to choose another job while the risk that evolved in the movement is a clear disadvantage."
10149,national pride or international effort? Some people argue that space exploration has had more to do with national pride than international effort. To what extent do you agree with this? How do you think space exploration will change in the future?,"Space exploration is no longer a mere idea. People now can go back and forth from Earth to space in the light of the advanced technology. However, some people believe that such activity seems to reflect on national pride rather than international effort, while in my opinion, it is more likely to be in reverse. Ċ The early era of space exploration was driven by a space race between Soviet Union and United States. Both countries attempted to maintain their national pride by executing more space exploration projects. However, by 2007, about 14 space agencies from different countries had agreed to share their interests, plans and activities in space exploration together under the name of ISECG (International Space Exploration Coordination Group). This cooperation had proven that the idea of national pride behind space projects is utterly unjustifiable. Ċ The fact that scientists have successfully overcome some major problems associated with space exploration such as equipment and cost, it is predicted that space projects will greatly improve in the future. Recently, more scientists and engineers have been keen on exploiting space in order to find some energy alternatives. They have come up with an idea to mine the asteroids and interestingly, the whole process will be done in the space. Although many people are a little bit sceptical, these scientists believe that such idea will be able to tackle the natural resources depletion in the Earth. Ċ The aforementioned evidence reveals that nowadays space exploration has nothing to do with national pride since the establishment of international organization. This also indicates that more countries are interested in space projects, therefore it is forecast space exploration will immensely evolve in the future."
10150,"Being a ""responsible tourist"" has been paid attention to protect both environment and cultural of the place visited, while someone believe it is impossible to be a responsible tourist. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","When it comes to the discussion of responsible tourists, people's view points differ vastly, rendering this issue the highest complexity. Some people argue that tourists should take responsibility to protect the place, not only in the environmental facet, but also to the extent of culture, while other people hold the view that it is almost impossible to be a responsible tourist. To the extent of my observation, the former view holds water. Ċ Our time has witnessed a society which is developing at such an unprecedented rate that anything we take as normal thing this second might as well turn into treasure right the next. In other word, it is required by our society that the tourists should try their best to protect the attraction keeps the same after their visit. Many local traditional cultures have extinct due to the proliferation of modern concepts, so it is absolutely the visitors' duty to protect native culture of the attraction from being impacted by their own points. Ċ Admittedly, it is quite hard to keep the famous spots from being damaged unless someone isolated it. The increasing number of tourists makes it even more difficult to protect the local environment and culture from being influenced by human behaviour. However, we still should try hard to keep them as the original views. It is undeniable that if those attractions are distinct, who will be influenced most is no one but the tourist. Ċ In conclusion, tourists are responsible to protect the local environment and culture. Only in this way can human beings benefit ourselves."
10151,The movements of people from the villages to the cities for work has caused a lots of problems in both places. What are the serious problems associated with this? What measures can be taken to solve these problems?,"The Industrialisation of megapolis has led to an increase in the percentage of persons migrating from rural to urban areas in search of greener pastures. It has therefore led to serious problems such as overpopulation, but there are a number of solutions available to tackle it. This essay will discuss the causes of rural-urban migration and profer solutions to it. Ċ One negative effect of rural exodus is the overpopulation of the urban areas. As more people leave the villages to the municipalities, the proportion of people in the city increases and consequently population explosion occurs. Lagos State ,for example, has become the most populous State in Nigeria due to the high influx of people into the State, resulting in several environmental problems including air, land and noise pollution from industrial and human activities, thus affecting health negatively. Furthermore, there is an increase in the rate of crime, as most urban dwellers are unemployed, a lot of them resort to illegal activities like as stealing and cybercrime. Ċ However, there are ways of tackling the situation. Firstly, the government can make life better for those in the rural areas through provision of basic amenities like hospitals, schools, potable water and electricity, and also by making sure these are available for all, as it will help curtail the number of persons trying to leave their present locations in search for a better one. Secondly, jobs should be created for all citizens, because, when everyone is engaged, it will drastically reduce criminal acts in the metropolis. Similarly, individuals can learn a skill for themselves, so they can earn a living without support from the government. Ċ In conclusion, although problems of overpopulation and increase in crime rate are common in the city due to rural depopulation, the government can tackle these issues by creating a better environment for its citizens to thrive."
10152,Many people argue that smoking should be banned due to its harmful effects on human health. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"In recent years, the devastating consequences of tobacco consumption on human health have been reached an alarming level. Therefore, some emphasize to impose a strict ban on consuming tobacco products. I partially agree with it as a complete restriction would not be possible since this industry has grown its roots deep down in our system, hence putting restrictions on smoking in particular areas is still a possibility. Ċ First of all, it is certainly true that smoking not only affects the user itself but also put the health of others at-risk, thus it must be banned. For instance, the recent research has shown that passive smoking, where a person inhales the smoke of a cigarette while being around a smoker, is relatively more harmful than active one because one could infect himself without actually doing it. With that said, it is imperative to legally restrict smoking at public places and other market places where people visit often. Ċ On the other hand, it seems impractical to illegalize tobacco due to the fact that it has grown as a huge industry now. For example, a sudden shutdown of it could destabilize the businesses attached to it and could raise a huge unemployment spike, which could be a challenge to cope with. Consequently, a partial prohibition might be a feasible option. Ċ In conclusion, the detrimental effects of smoking on human health are undeniable and this practice must be banned in certain places; however, I oppose the total ban of it as this industry is providing a source of income for a lot of people."
10153,"In many developing nations, the rush to become industrialized has created major problems with air and water quality. Ċ What are the problems that this has brought about and offer some solutions to these problems?","In this modern era, there is a tremendous increase in industrialization in developing countries. Due to which, air and water pollution has become the major problem not only in emergent nations but at the global level. This essay will discuss, what are the difficulties the community is facing and how these problems can be solved. Ċ Firstly, because of the increasing number in the manufacturing sector, the massive amount of chemical waste is being thrown into rivers. Moreover, it affects the quality of water and also impacts the natural habitat. For an instance, in India, the death by drinking unsafe water has risen this year as compared to the last year. Secondly, smoke which comes out of factories contains harmful gases, which is injurious for health. Furthermore, it affects at the larger level. To illustrate the above statement, in the year 2018 scientist has discovered, that air pollution is the main reason for ozone layer depletion. Ċ There are a plethora of solutions to overcome the above-stated problem, authorities should come up with an alternative process to produce the material which spread a massive amount of pollution. One clear example of this, in the USA government, has asked all the companies to re-use the plastic items other than producing it. Additionally, few countries have started using commercial air filters to purify the air. For example, Chain has installed ten thousand huge air purifier in Hong Kong. As a result air quality has improved drastically. Ċ In conclusion, this essay has discussed both views and gave reasons as well. Air and water in the essential element for all the living being on earth. To prevent these resources is our major responsibility. Countries should share their ideas with each other, how to overcome these issues."
10154,University lecturers are now able to put their lecturers on the internet for students to read and so the importance face to face lecturers has been reduced.  Do you believe the use of the internet in formal education is a good idea? What future effects will the internet have on academic study? The Effect of the Internet Use on Students,"The technology has changed the different ways of studying. One of them is using the internet for holding lecturers without going to the universities. There are mixed ideas about the Internet has a positive influence on the formal education. And the internet will change the style of academic learning. Ċ The internet has changed the style of academic leaning and teaching. The bachelor and postgraduate students do not use as many text book as the students used to do. Because, now students use the internet and the online journals and books for their researches. And for the report they do not give the lecturer hand writing report. They type their final researches. Also in the future, they will just stay in their houses or work places and follow their seminars and lectures with high speed internet. Therefore, they do not speed time on journey from houses to universities. Ċ On the other hand, using the internet has many disadvantages. The communications among the students will be disappeared. Therefore, there will be no information exchanging among these students and they could not evaluate themselves in comparison with other students during a term. So, they do not have huge among of motivation to study hard. Also, studying is a scenery activity which needs considerable time to be alone. If the students do not need to go to the campus, they will face some mental diseases or they will become depressed. Ċ In conclusion, the internet has positive influence on omitted the extra time and money which spend on going to the universities. But, being in the campus can help students to have high level of social connections."
10155,These days people prefer to eat ready food outside of their home rather than home made food. Do you think this has more advantages and disadvantages,"Nowadays people opt more to eat ready-made food from a restaurant rather than a healthy homemade dish. However, in my opinion, it is always better to consume self-cooked meals because it is rich in nutrition and the outside foods are expensive. Ċ When a meal is planned and cooked, it is more healthy for everyone having it. Preparing it by ourselves will give us a chance to incorporate all the healthy ingredients into it in a proportionate manner which will provide all the nutrition required for a human body in day-to-day life. For example, planning a particular dish by including the necessary ingredients consisting of vitamins, protein, carbohydrates, minerals and fat can only be achieved when it is self-made. Hence, the food made at one's house is always a better choice to stay naturally fit. Ċ Additionally, purchasing lunch alone every day is quite costly and if choosing it for all other times of the day, then it will be very expensive for a common man and buying the groceries is a lot more affordable compared to it. Especially, if you trying have a healthy one; for instance, a salad bowl or grilled chicken are sold at a high rate than the other oily and unhealthy ones. Therefore, people must not spend much money on a pre-made dish which can be easily made through the items bought at a less price. Ċ In conclusion, although, people throughout the world these days enjoy having their dinner and lunch at a restaurant , it is always more advisable to prepare it at home as it is way cheaper and healthier."
10156,"Rising university fees and limited employment prospects for graduates have led some people to say that universities should not teach arts subjects, like philosophy and history, and should only offer practical degree courses that maximize chances of employment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In today's competitive world, there are almost twice the students as compared to the number of jobs in the fields like philosophy and history. Certain people believe that institutes should close such arts courses and should include more practical degree courses. I completely disagree with this and think every subject has there own value and should be taught at higher levels also. Ċ On the one hand, I believe that students should be allowed to study arts subjects because of freedom and options. In other words, children should have the freedom to choose what subjects they want to study. For example, my friend's Raj parents wanted him to become a doctor but he wanted to be a photographer, but his parents forced him into MBBS. He dropped out after two years as he was forced to do something he did not like. Additionally, by giving more options to study, students can be divided into different subjects equally. this can help them to understand things better in class. Ċ On the other hand, some people want arts subjects should not be taught at universities because of the limited number of jobs and higher fees. But this approach can have several drawbacks. Firstly, there will more students in all other courses, hence increasing competition among students to get limited employment. For instance, currently ,ten people interview for a Java developer job but after this ,the number of students might go to a hundred. Secondly, there would be no expert on these subjects and by the time might disappear from our study course. Ċ To conclude, I strongly believe that schools should be allowed to teach all subjects as it gives students more options and freedom to choose from. moreover ,if this does not happen, we might end up losing arts subject permanently from our study course."
10157,Some people claim that many things that children are taught at school are a waste of time. Other people argue that everything that children study at school is useful at sometime. Ċ Discuss the both views and give your opinion.,"The education at school or teaching at home has been a major bone of contention for parents as one group supports that subjects taught at academies are redundant while others believe that learning at school is important for a future of a kid. In my opinion, sending children to learning establishments should be encouraged as not only do they impart theoretical knowledge but prepares students with essential skills required in life ahead. This essay shall discuss both the views of why people believe sending children to schools is a time waste while others argue that learnings from school life never goes in vain. Ċ On the one hand, due to the competition and requirement of vocational skills growing fiercely in the education sector, many individuals believe that learning academies are a total wastage of time for their kids. In other words, they speculate that knowledge shared at home or vocational institutions is far better than what is taught inside the school buildings and will keep kids in good stead. For example, the mandatory studying of some subjects like Physics in the curriculum makes a child loses interest in learning which impacts the overall grades eventually leading to demoralizing a youngster. Thus, parents when observing this downgrading of their wards performance start to speculate that these institutions are trashing the duration on their kids rather than transferring knowledge. Ċ On the other hand, many individuals understand that schools are a necessity in a child's life so it is essential to send them for gaining skills that cannot be taught at home. To elaborate further, when a child goes out of the protective shield of their homes, they learn to find solutions to daily problems on their own rather than always looking for help. Also, students can gauge their areas of interests better by learning decision making at institutions. For instance, most of the world-renowned sportspersons started young at school while participating in games competitions and extra-curricular activities. This acted as a catalyst for them to make a name for themselves in the field other than the books. Hence, individuals believe that apart from studies, children learn various other skills at schools which aptly support them in deciding their future course of action. Ċ In conclusion, this essay regards that to learn additional and grab knowledge outside the bookish world, parents should be motivated and encouraged to bring students to schools rather than speculating that the subjects taught at schools are a wastage of time."
10158,Recently published figures show that the wildlife population around the world has decreased by around fifty per cent over the last fifty years. What can we do to help protect the wildlife around the world?,"The latest news about wildlife shouts quite loud that the population has been cut in half in the past fifty years. Sadly, this trend is easily observable in all areas and climate zones. For sure, powerful human civilizations could apply some force to reduce a significant part of the harm caused and potentially restore wildlife populations. Let’s think about what could be done in the first place to help protect our planet neighbours. Ċ First and foremost, it’s required to preserve habitation and conditions of the essential needs of rare breeds and species in danger. This also includes applying high environment protection standards and ecology technologies. For example, water sources are highly important for wildlife populations surviving, so industry and manufacturers should use isolated water cycles to prevent waste. With the wide availability of clean water as a base for new green areas and reforestation, it will be possible to repopulate woods with animals and birds again. Ċ Furthermore, the power of the human is quite often aimed at the lives of animals with some pretending that it’s required for human survival. But, in most cases, that’s not exactly true because people could instead eat a lot of different greens, vegetables and nuts, replacing meat, fish and eggs. For instance, purchasing new shoes made from alligator skin isn’t about basic human needs. According to eastern philosophy, all these little and big creatures have little and big souls inside, so the human soul could give a hand to reduce pain and save lives. This way, humans should save and protect their smaller brothers with ideas of true kindness and humanity in everyone’s head. Ċ In conclusion, being the most powerful creatures on this planet, humans have to be responsible for how this power is used and what it causes. It should be more attractive in society to be a protector of Mother Nature and all of her children and that’s what we should teach our kids about."
10159,"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree. Give your opinion.","These days, there are presumptions such as a great stake of hiring people should take place by giving due consideration to characteristics rather than just the certifications and past experience. I partially agree with the given statement because humans always strive to upskill themselves and their past plays an influential role in allocating the work but not the only part. In my opinion, recruiters should put significant concentration on the fresher's characteristics rather than on experience alone. Ċ To begin with, firstly, there are a plethora of circumstances that could intervene in a student educational options like finances, resources and pressure. Thereafter, under the influence, a student would possibly enrol in a course even if it is not what he wanted. However, his motivation and inspiration are what makes him learn things. Secondly, there is no assurance that an extremely qualified person achieves exemplary things . Furthermore, the nature of the person makes him feel accountable for it and guides him to finish it. For instance, a friend of mine who hails from a small village with little education because of his interest now works on par with candidates who hail from top most universities. Thus, the past is not only the deciding factor. Ċ On the other hand, there are a few scenarios where this decision could also turn out to be wrong such as making a person from the technical domain work on the finances of the association. Next, without proper qualifications, the employee would actually cause a decline in the productivity of the association. To illustrate it, an ex-employee of my company who had great technical knowledge was made to work on the company marketing side it caused severe disasters to their economy. To sum up, a variety of factors needs to be involved while hiring a newbie. Ċ In summary, behavioural tendencies need to be genuinely valued during selecting a candidate while also being aware of their academics and knowledge."
10160,Some people believe that restoration of old buildings costs too much; we should demolish them and build new ones instead. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"When talking about refurbishings and renovations, many people are of the opinion that structures that have been up a really long time should be destroyed and a new one built in its stead. I strongly concur with this reasoning and in this essay, I will discuss why. Ċ The first obvious reason is money. Owing to the fact that a building that has been up for while has undergone a lot of wear and tear, renovating will cost an arm and a leg. Many times, the building is already falling apart from age. For instance, roofs may be leaking, pipes may have burst in walls and many other unseen problems. Because of this, almost everything will need to be taken apart and replaced. The amount of cash sunk into such projects is unbelievable and it is more expedient to demolish the structure and build it to taste. Ċ This leads me to the second reason I am pro-demolishing. Although old buildings may be somewhat a spectacle, many ancient buildings are really just that, ancient, with nothing to write home about. With our ever-changing times and progress in architecture, there are now several designs that are both functional and aesthetic. Attempting to redo and old building according to modern standards is like passing a camel through a needle's eye. You may end up with a very confused-looking house for example. Ċ In conclusion, I believe people should go right ahead and pull down aged constructions because of the outrageous amounts of resources that will need to be spent trying to make it new. Doing this will save plenty of money and help the project managers easily conform to modern architectural expectations."
10161,"Medical services are quite necessary for one's health. Therefore, some people think that medical services should be run by the government rather than by profit-making companies. To what extent do you agree or disagree.","The progress of medical services is inevitable and necessary. What's under controversy is that whether it should be run by the government or to profit-making companies. From my point of view, running by the government maybe a better choice for the medical services. Ċ What's of the top priority is that government can give a better control of the medical services, like the medical price, quality and so on. Doctors in such hospitals are more famous than the profit-making companies because of their high quality and various working experience,. Ċ On second thoughts, profit-making companies may the disease to patient in order to get more profit from them. As we know, the main purpose of these company is to get as much profit as possible so that patients may have to m=pay a large amount of money for a light disease only. Ċ However, profit-making companies still have its own merits. It is always known for us about its nice environment, the superior services and high efficiency. People who is suffering an emergency disease can also choose door service out of the working time. That's what the government service can never hold a handle to. This kind of service can bring us more convenient in some settings so that it also has a huge market needs. Ċ Just as a saying goes, every coin has its two sides. Personally I would highlight the merits of the government medical service more than the profit-making company."
10162,Some people think that increasing the number of police officers on the street is the only effective way to reduce crime. Do you agree or disagree?,"Whenever a vital crime occurred, people started wondering which measures the government could probably take in order to administrate the public security better again. Having more police officers on the street was frequently considered at the moment as one of choices. Ċ A four-year-old girl was beheaded in front of her mother in Taipei street on March 28th, local media have reported. The public yielded, and screamed for reassuring personal safety. The officials quickly announced that there would be patrols twenty-four-seven, aiming to not only deter crime but raise the sense of awareness overall. Such policy had made some people feel much more comfortable after the slaughter. They believed it was the only effective way to reduce crime. Ċ On the other hand, there had been a shortage of the police for several years. This strategy no doubt posed pressure on the police officers who had already had a variety of works to address on a daily basis. The police union had asked the public to emphasize their rights or they couldn't dominate the public security efficiently even if they had increased the number of the police officers on the street. The operation of long-term solution rather than short-sighted policy was needed. Ċ In summary, enlarging the number of the police officers isn't the only effective way to prevent crime in my opinion. Arranging the workforce of the police, reducing the social inequality, and valid legislation may be other choices as well."
10163,These days many students are doing a part time job. Is it a good or a bad development? What is your opinion about it? Give examples from your own experience.,"It is matter of intense debate that whether students should do part time job or only concentrate on their academic study. It is true that, with the social and economic development, the number of students doing part time job increased considerably. This approach has some pros and cons. Before reaching the conclusion, I will look into both side of this approach. Ċ On one side, people who oppose students from doing part time job have opinion that, every person has to do job or business after completion of their studies. But university or school students need only to concentrate on their studies, as this helps them to attain good grades in exams. Eventually this will be more helpful for them to build their career after pass out from universities. Ċ On the other hand, people who encourage and support students to do part time job, think that, this approach teaches students some important life skills, such as time management. Student who do part time job, have to manage their time wisely as they have to complete their daily commitments like study and assignments. Furthermore they also earn some money which helps to ease the burden their parent's shoulder. Also this helps them to bear their daily expenses like lodging and boarding charges. Moreover they can better understand the value of money so they spend them carefully. These skills make them a responsible person of the society. Ċ To put in a nutshell, I pen down by saying that, pros of doing part time job while studding outweigh the cons, because students learns most important life skills and can become successful in their career."
10164,Some people say that schools should concentrate on teaching students academic subjects that will be useful for their future careers. Other people say that subjects such as music and sports are also necessary. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.,"It is believed that teaching academic subjects should be the principal approach of schools to prepare students for better jobs in their future, while alternative subjects such as music and sports should also be included in the curriculum. Both viewpoints are justifiable, but I personally lean towards the latter. Ċ oOn the one hand, academic subject indeed significant. In fact, it is the bulk of the best way to have a good career after graduation. Such as math, science and language, whose performance is placed heavy emphasis on education and employers alike. Ċ oOn the other hand, it is claimed that non-academic subjects cannot be discounted altogether. Having said that, they may not be directly helpful in securing employment, they indirectly make a candidate more employable. For instance, the person, who learn how to sing or play a musical instrument could bring benefits for students in networking events or have job promotions. Another compelling reason why non-academic subjects should be taught in school is that it allows talented student in athletic and artistic fields to be discovered. In addition to this, non-academic could bring benefits to students as they help them to improve their strength to work under pressure after a nerve cracking semester or they could expand their professional network by playing sports with their colleagues or partners. Ċ oIn conclusion, I reckon that academic subjects should be given precedence in school, but it is also important that students should learn another subjects such as music and sport."
10165,"If you sell a product and people buy it, then advertising it is not necessary and considered as a kind of entertainment. Do you agree or disagree?","In today's generation, people are motivated to multi-task and prefer taking out leisure time that might benefit them in some regards. Similarly, advertisements play an important role in providing relaxation by entertaining and encourage them to buy the brand if they wish to. In my opinion, I disagree with the fact that advertisements are merely for entertainment, it rather helps buyers to increase the sale while putting a smile on the customer’s face. Ċ Firstly, considering a large-scale business, where target-sale are promised to be in millions and billions, it is challenging for buyers to reach-out all the customers in person and brief them about the product. For example, scheduling and briefing about the merchandise may be tiring and may question the ability of employees if the purchase rate goes down. Therefore, the thought of eliminating the combination of fun and sell may cost an arm and a leg which might not be the focused goal of the companies. Ċ Secondly, individuals who are busy building their future better by working extra hours may not prefer consulting salesperson for buying merchandise. For instance, people working in the technology sector might not prefer scheduling a meeting regarding which products they should buy but will opt to enjoy funny banner and advertisements that help to suggest the brand is better than the rest. Hence, the goal of achieving the product sale of companies are full-filled and individuals get the spare time enjoyment which convinces them to buy certain products, in this way end goal of both buyer and seller is achieved. Ċ To conclude, advertisement not only helps us release stress but in addition helps industries to present their products to customers in an interesting manner which generally helps them to consider buying the product. Also, selling a brand personally may be an option but elevating the sale by advertisement is the best way to interact with customers."
10166,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Dancing plays an important role in a culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"In every country, people do dance for fun, for entertrain, and for decrease a stress. Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe. Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture. And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion. Ċ First, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe. For example, some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life. Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief. Ċ Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture. for instance, I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom, king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture. The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture. Ċ Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves. And dancing is one of that ways. Both people who see and dance also have a good time. For example, many event, such as christmas, last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts, and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song. I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy. Ċ In conclusion, I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people. Besides, dancing could show how civilization of that culture is. Moreover, people use dancing to entertain themselves. So dancing is important in every culture."
10167,Nowadays there is a trend that media focuses on problems and emergencies rather than positive developments. Some people think that it is harmful to individual and societies. To what extent do you agree ?,"It is truly confined that mass communication is raising curiosity among the viewers by telecasting more under progress to-do list. Instead, this should emphasize on many achievements is being done in the country. In this essay, I will discuss what I state my opinion and how this can impact a person or to the whole society. Ċ In this awake of Global access world, many people believe that mass communication is immensely becoming stronger with different trend analysis on particular news headline. Additionally, this has strengthened the nation for awareness and the right to know information which was missing in the earlier technology. However, this tends to manipulate the information and sometimes overly residual political defame and their privacy. For instance, the underdevelopment index is the main forte of media to concise one's attention. Whether, it is infrastructure drainage problems, scarcity of schools and housing developments or medical emergencies. Although, these problems are at a high pitch on the Government's list to handle soon. Furthermore, due to overpopulation, it is been delayed proposing with a positive solution. Ċ On the contrary, the media is silent on positive developments that are being done for the public and they do not draw the audience focus evenly. The underlying reason is that such topics are not meant for this industry to propel the people for effective progress. Due to the over-sized country, many emergencies are not planned in prior by the Government and to be handled as and when it arrives. For instance, in this pandemic, medical emergencies were high in requirements. Since, the Government was taking precautions, and helping the nation to get medical assistance despite the death fall ratio went enormous. Thus, this influential matter was broadcasted by the media as a problem and emergency. However, other developments like in providing enough social institutes and amenities for medical patients was not much talked about. Ċ To conclude the above, Media is strong and should drive the nation dwellers for better the community and meticulously to handle the grey-areas with an amicable solution. While they give adverse impact in listing the problems that should not be with the purpose to affect a person or a society to rethink their living or to be questioning the Government for their negative developments."
10168,only one car for a household? The ownership of car should be restricted to one per family in order to reduce traffic congestion and pollution To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The problem of traffic congestion and pollution has been increasing at an alarm rate since last few years all over the world. Thus, many experts come up with the solution that every family should be allowed to have only one vehicle. While, Some people consider that having many vehicles represents their high status. In reality, more vehicle will increase environmental health hazards on human beings. Ċ On the one hand, Due to current progressive industrial development and increased per capita income. Firstly, people consider using other available mode of public transport like bus, train, rickshaw is time consuming and some time not considered to be the safe. Secondly, travelling in public transport is treated as sign of a lower class in the society. In contrary, having more than one vehicle for a family is considered as wealthy status. In addition, ease of getting vehicle-loan through banks help them to become owner of vehicle and can be easily payable in coming month. Ċ on the other hand, some people argue that, Increasing number of vehicles on the road increases air pollution, sound pollution, In addition, to overcome the traffic congestion, robust infrastructure development and broader roads are to be prepared by cutting down the trees which further allows to increase the harmful gases in the environment and these gases are considered as eminent in human organ damage, For Example, Recent study carried out by Environmental Tribunal in New Delhi India elaborate that reduction in number of trees in recent years to develop road infrastructure has increased 30% of Carbon-Di-Oxide, increasing 20% of human deaths due to lung failure in last six months, Ċ From what has been discussed above, I tend to strongly support government initiative to have single ownership of vehicle in each family to save human being from environmental health hazards."
10169,"All over the world, societies are facing a growing problem with obesity. This problem affects both children and adults. What are the reasons for this rise in obesity, How could it be tackled?","In recent years, the youth are attracted more towards fast foods and have a lesser interest in nutritious food. As a result, parents are facing problems with an increase in the weight of their offspring. In this essay, we will discuss the problems related to obesity and the possible solutions which we can implement to be rid of the concern. Ċ Firstly, with the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, people are barred from going out and follow their daily routine. Therefore, everyone is bound within the four walls of their homes and carry out a minimal amount of work. For instance, electronic gadgets appear to be one of the best ways to pass time, which leads to laziness and causes the body to accumulate fat. For example, as part of day-to-day work, an individual, after completing his online classes, has lunch and prefers resting on the couch while playing on his mobile phone. Hence, to overcome such problems, parents must encourage their children to work out or practise yoga in their leisure time. Ċ Secondly, with the increase in population, a lot of construction is going on to create business and residential infrastructure. Thus, there are fewer playgrounds and gardens left, where people can gather and play. To illustrate, youngsters, over the past few years have stopped going out to play due to a lack of playing space and have instead developed interest in video games and social media applications. As these interests do not involve physical activities, gaining weight is the obvious outcome. So, the government's town plan and building regulations must mandate play areas and help in mitigating the increasing problem of obesity. Ċ Finally, with correct guidance from parents and appropriate measures by governing bodies, the overweight problem among children and adults can be controlled. In conclusion, by including workouts and a healthy diet in our lifestyle we can maintain a healthy weight."
10170,The movement of people from villages to cities for work can cause serious problems in both Ċ places. What are the serious problems associated with this? What measures can be taken to Ċ solve these problems?,"Unemployment in the countryside is one of the widespread issues the world is facing today. People are relocating from their native villages to the towns and it has brought certain challenges in both ecosystems. This essay will discuss the various reasons with possible solutions which can help to curb this negative development. Ċ To start with ,there are several complications associated with this development. The first and foremost is the saturated opportunities in the city. To elaborate , As more people are migrating to the cities resulting in fewer job options. For example, the Unemployment rate has increased by 10 per cent in Bengaluru in the last 2 years. Secondly, Overpopulation in urban areas can cause a lack of adequate housing and this could result in the destruction of forests and the building up of multistory buildings. finally, the movement of people from agricultural areas would result in the eradication of farming as few folks will be involved in agriculture. This will result in decreased food production. For instance, as a result of urbanization nowadays Kerala is depending on other states for rice and vegetables, which were produced abundantly in the past. Ċ There is indeed no problem without a solution. This mass movement can be prohibited to a large extent by providing them Add the preposition with It appears that you are missing a preposition with the verb providing. Consider adding the preposition. Ċ show examplesenough sources of earnings in the villages. Basic facilities like transportation, water , electricity etc ,Free education ,and health care services play an instrumental role in controlling urbanization.Moreover, agriculture is no longer a profitable business ,and officials need to inculcate the technology and research into this domain to make it valuable again."
10171,"Topic: Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.","In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem. Ċ It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers , broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries. Ċ On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fluel can releases cacbon dioxit into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. Ċ In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, It does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices."
10172,"Stress is a serious problem Title:  In some societies, stress is now regarded as a major problem, and it is thought that people suffer from more stress than they this in the past. However, others feel that the amount of stress people have today is exaggerated. They say that previous generations were under more pressure, the idea of suffering from stress did not exist. Discuss both these views and give your opinions.","Nowadays, stress is a serious problem that is spreading in many societies. While some people believe that there is a lot of pressure than in the past, others argue that in the past the life was stressful but the people accepted it. I completely support the latter argument. Ċ All ages even young people have stress in their lives. For instance, the employers give their employees many tasks and difficult targets to be achieved in a short time.Therefore the employees work under pressure for a long time every day or they could lose their jobs. Also, the teenagers suffer from stress too.For example, the market is very competitive, so the teenagers should get high scores in their studies and took several courses. Ċ In the past, the life was so difficult for people as there were no facilities that present today. For example, in their homes, they didn't have all the equipment that people take for granted now such as fridges, microwaves, oven, and washing machines..etc. Also, in factories, there were no machines and most of their jobs were done manually.Moreover, there was a deficiency in the medications so the patients suffered and the mortality rate was high. Ċ In conclusion, people today suffer from pressures different from that present in the past. In the past, people didn't complain from stress and accept their life, however, in recent years the people talk about it."
10173,More and more people today are moving from the countryside. Why is this happening? Do you think it is a positive or negative development,"These days, the influx of residents from rural areas to metropolises is growing exponentially. From my perspective, there is a host of compelling reasons leading to this negative migration. Ċ To begin with, there is a plethora of causes accounting for the migration of suburb residents to cities. Firstly, those who migrated from the countryside to urban areas desire to apply for a job. In other words, the rapid economic growth of affluent cities is bringing about plenty of job opportunities which attracts blue-collar workers from rural areas to earn a good living in cities, resulting in improving their lives. Additionally, it is the educational purpose that appeals to less developed areas. Specifically, universities and colleges are often situated in large cities in which have a modern and convenient transport system. Therefore, parents in rural areas usually have a tendency to encourage their offsprings to leave their home to get a better education in urban areas. Ċ Nevertheless, the migration wave from rural areas is leaving detrimental impacts on cities. The influx of rural citizens from the countryside will contribute to overpopulation in cities. Consequently, this will exert severe pressure on the housing market, transportation, health care system and other aspects. Another negative effect is the prospect of an increase in the crime rate. In case people from rural areas living in cities fail to apply for a job, they are likely to commit a crime such as drug-trafficking or even human trafficking. Take Vietnam as a typical example, 39 deaths were confirmed in a refrigerated truck in Essex in the United Kingdom in 2019, which was a consequence of human trafficking caused by those people who are unemployed in a rural district in Vietnam. Ċ In conclusion, it is obvious that there are plenty of causes that contribute to the migration from rural areas to large cities, which are job opportunities and educational purposes. To curb the spread of this trend, it is highly recommended that universities and large enterprises should be relocated and partly moved to the countryside to create a balance between job opportunities in rural and urban areas."
10174,The education you receive from your family is more important than the education you receive from school. To what extend do you agree with this statement and why ?,"Today children are upbringing and learning in a big society and Besides this, two straightforward way are family and school. A bunch of people say that family teaching is more notable, however other people argue that school is much more important. I share opinion on that family is more striking as I shall go on to show. Ċ Firstly, youngster learn from their parents before they go to school and learn there. As a result of that they are formed by family first and this makes  fundamental of their manner. If parents do not care about this period of time commitment of crime may will be raising. Ċ Secondly, juvenile spend as fewer time as they do in home which means there are a lot of routine to learn more than in school and this is because family is more important and they might better have good plan to direct children to god way with appropriate attitudes. Ċ Furthermore, because of all different culture and variety of behavior that someone can face with at school, so education from school can be efficient and to point out other part of children construct in school. Ċ To conclude, I believe that family nurture is much more notable than school, yet it can lead to bad result if either parents or government have plan to teach all things children need."
10175,"Some people believe that crime is a result of social problems and poverty, others think that crime is a result of bad person’s nature. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","While some individuals think that offences are the production of social unrest, others opine that it is just an innate characteristic of human. In my opinion, both the statements are true if we consider prime reasons for offences. Ċ On the one hand, the lack of basic needs promotes a person for committing crimes. Many people in the world are living below the level of poverty and they have a limited amount of food, garments, shelters, treatment and academic facilities. Hence, lacking these thinks makes humans adopting the wrong ways, like stealing or kidnapping, to avail these to ensure their survival in the world. Moreover, if there is more wrongdoers are available in society, it is possible to raise the percentage of this because the surrounding could be influenced by them and associated with violence. For example, In Bangladesh, pick-pocketing has increased drastically after a great fall of GDP. Ċ Nevertheless, psychological aspects can drive anyone to become criminal. Every human in the world is unique and belongs to a vibrant personality; therefore, they can have both good or bad attributes in their characteristics. In such circumstance, if someone inherits bad habits, that might leads that person to do wrong tasks. Besides, some individuals might have a mental disorder, which also could be a cause of his involvement in the violence. For instance, in many cases, after investigation, it has been revealed that a growing number of serial killers were psychopaths. Ċ In conclusion, people have contrasting views, whether the poor living conditions or their own personality is the major cause behind the violence. I believe, both these reasons are proved for the up rate of offences."
10176,"Some people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable. Ċ Discuss this view and give your opinion.","Many opine that exerting physical forces to monitor children is a suitable method and this should be accepted. However ,some people claim that this is extremely wrong as well as unacceptable. From my point of view ,I believe that these ways can not be effective. Ċ Firstly ,in my opinion ,physical forces are the worst ways that the population habitually perform. For example ,in most developing countries nowadays ,in some educational centres teachers use this measure to control the anarchies that students create. There is no denying that this could cause emotional problems and some mental disorders such as personality disorders. Additionally ,this operation could create a space to escape from schools by pupils. Most of them decide to abandon learning. Therefore ,this makes it clear it is a wrong common belief that some people impose on the community. Ċ By contrast ,others believe it can be useful. For instance ,we all know one of the most persuasive ways to stop making noise pollutions by a child is utilising a physical force. These people regularly claim disciplining offspring is possible just by performing these types of forces. Moreover ,human beings usually say ,to conduct it, a scion decides to become quiet and accept rules. As a result ,it becomes apparent there is a permanent reason behind each claim via societies. Ċ All things considered ,I personally opine that can not be an appropriate measure to make regulations that are essential for offspring. It is predicted that to continue it the number of children who suffer from side_effects will be increased considerably."
10177,"Higher Education Costs Higher education could be funded in three ways. All costs paid by government, all costs paid by students or students paying all costs through a government loan. What are the advantages of these choices?","In the contemporary era, education has become a substantial necessity for every individual. For getting school knowledge, students can enrol in the courses, and they have to pay a certain amount of fee. Many alternatives to pay-off the bill of a study has given the various opportunities to the learner. This essay will elucidate the benefits of these options. Ċ To begin, with the help of such choices, a poor person could also attain a high level of education, who may be unable to manage his/her fund for university-level courses. For example- The 'study loan' scheme of a government could higher the chances of getting foreign knowledge for middle-class people. Therefore, the fund provided by authorities as credit can be an advantage for those masses, who are, otherwise, even cannot dream for it. Hence, this can be seen as a positive side of these ways of funding. Ċ Furthermore, paying all the cost by the government as a scholarship for the high marks earner could be another benefit for an individual, who is not efficient in bearing the price of courses as himself. For instance, A low-income intelligent person could plan for further study after achieving the reward from the provincial government. As a result, the various options provided by colleges and universities for the payment of education is the best platform for children, rather than only one option. Ċ In conclusion, the choice for students is a source of increasing the literacy rate in a developing country and support for those people who want to get more qualification for their bright future."
10178,Youngsters do not participate in their community these times Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"It is really critical that youngsters to contribute in their society since they regard as a more energetic group of each community. Personally, I believe that young generations do not dedicate sufficient time to assist to their society. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay. Ċ First of all, young people have not been taught the value of engaging in their community. To be more specific, education systems do not allocate any courses that teach students the importance of contribution in their society, or parents just encourage their children to study hard in order to be a top student; therefore, get a well-paid job after graduation. Ċ Secondly, technology has changed peoples' life especially young adults. Technologies like computers or the Internet take away a much free time of young people, so they do not have time for other activities like taking part in their communities' issues. In other words, they spend their free time in the virtual world rather than the real world. Consequently, they are not aware of what happens in their communities. For instance, when they have spare time, they try to surf the Internet, use social media, listen to music, or play games. Ċ In conclusion, I am of the opinion that young people these days do not participate in their community. This is due to the fact that they have not learned the values of community and how to take part in it, and because the advent of technology has altered life."
10179,Some people think that teachers at school are more responsible for children's intellectual and social development than parents. To what extend do you agree or disagree? What is your personal opinion?,"Currently, with the growing importance of education, parents devote themselves to providing their children with the best education. However, many people advocate that teachers of students tend to have more influence on their mental and social development than parents. Ċ Admittedly, teachers in school are of considerable significance to help students learn the knowledge from text books. Because of the professional training teachers received before, they would definitely know how to do with the cultivation of children's intellect. Also, school is just like a little society, for example, it is possible for children to learn how to be sociable when their teachers show how to deal with some little quarrels between two students. Moreover, compared to their parents, children are inclined to follow their teachers' instructions. Ċ Granted, we all know that parent is a child's first teacher. Parents are the ones who occupy most of a child's time. Every single day, a child is living in the surroundings of parents' words and deeds, so he or she could easily learn some social skills from his or her daily life with parents. Even if parents do not have professional certifications as teachers do, they can still help their children with many affairs. Not only did they receive good education, but they love their children much more than anyone else does. Ċ In my opinion, both teachers and parents are of vital importance to cultivate an intelligent and sociable child. If they can cooperate well, the aim will be achieved easily."
10180,Some schools put the most advanced students in separate classes from their peers so they can study more challenging materials. Do the advantages of this practice outweigh the disadvantages?,"In some curriculums, it is quite common to have different classrooms for the class toppers from other students for advanced studies. Although some sceptics argue that schools ought to teach the pupil considering their grades, this essay argues that the drawbacks overweigh the benefits. Ċ One obvious disadvantage of adapting this system is the rise of depression at an early age. This is due to the fact that students are getting separated from their peers on the basis of performance in academics at a young age. For example, being apart from their friends due to the poor results will create a thought of unworthiness. As a result, they will doubt their own abilities and end in deep sorrow. Another problem is that it is pure discrimination because everyone in the class should receive an equal quality of education regardless of their exam results. In such cases, they can learn about all the topics which will be useful for their future. Thus, separating students on the basis of the evaluation report is unethical and will forge serious mental problems in their early stages of life. Ċ On the contrary, having different classrooms based on the academic level will ease teachers to concentrate more on both. This is because they can prepare their notes effectively, which is beneficial for the students. For instance, teaching hard modules for low graded ones will not help them to learn and also easy lessons might not be productive for intellectuals. Another benefit is that students can mould their grades from average to high level eventually. The reason is that since tutors put more effort into them, they could correlate with that and learn by the time pass by. Therefore, this classroom system can help teachers and students alike. Ċ To conclude, separate classes among students have both benefits and drawbacks. However, it is clear that disadvantages do eclipse the merits because they are meant to teach together rather than separating them by their marks."
10181,Some believe advertisement is useful and informative. Others think it is false and only helps to raise prices. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"People have different views about adverts. While some argue that advertisements are valuable, I believe that they are useless and only create demand for products. Ċ One the one hand, there are several reasons why advertisements can be seen as helpful. The main reason is that commercials inform us of new commodities. Without adverts it would be difficult for people to know about cutting-edge, useful products on the market, and it also might be challenging for companies to tell customers about their products. Another key benefit is that advertising creates massive job opportunities. In other words, advertising is a creative industry that employs many people. A final point to consider is that advertising is considered to be a form of modern art. Ċ In spite of the above arguments, I agree with those who believe that adverts are false and useless. Firstly, advertising manipulates people in a negative way. In other words, it aims to persuade people that buying a product will make them happier. Secondly, children can easily be attracted by advertisements. As a result, they put pressure on their parents to buy them things that are very expensive, useless or even harmful. Finally, adverts market unhealthy and dangerous products in an attractive way. Energy drinks, for example, are advertised as being able to boost your energy and make you feel alert, while the reality is that their side effects are downright damaging. Ċ In conclusion, it seems to me that advertisements are more likely to be deceptive rather than informative."
10182,"Nowadays many students have the opportunity to study for part or all of their courses in foreign countries. While studying abroad brings many benefits to individual students, it also has a number of disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree?","In today's world, many young people wish to enter universities to be successful in their life and some of them choose foreign universities. I strongly agree that studying abroad has more merits rather than drawbacks. This will be shown by analyzing advantages of an international diploma as well as experience in a foreign language and some disadvantages like separation with a family and difficulties of living abroad. Ċ On the one hand, people who got education in the worldwide known universities are more competitive in the labor market. For instance, most of company chiefs pay strong attention to qualification of a recruiter and a diploma especially in tandem with knowledge of a foreign language in a high level could play a big role during an interview with an employer. However, a diploma of a local little-known university can not offer any privilege when applying for a job. Thus this makes it clear the main advantage of international education. Ċ On the other hand, studying abroad brings some disadvantages. For example, students are separated with family members and friends for a long period of time and this fact could make young people feel melancholy. Furthermore, living and studying in a foreign country always needs a lot of money and students have to visit their universities and work simultaneously. Fortunately, these troubles are temporary. From this it becomes quite evident that such kind of problems could not outweigh advantages which were mentioned above. Ċ In conclusion, courses in a foreign university should be very helpful for everybody who does not afraid difficulties. Thus it is clear why studying abroad should bring a lot of merits as well as some problems which make people more stronger in spirit. After analyzing this subject, I would probably recommend that students should weigh their strength before entering in a foreign university."
10183,Intelligent machines such as robots are widely applier to take the place of human beings. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.,"Some of lastest technological innovations are believed to gradually replace human workforce in a wide range of industries. The drawbacks and benefits of this trend will be carefully examined in this essay. Ċ On the one hand, smart devices and machines definitely make the manufacturing progress become much more productive. Since the machines are all programmed to perform the tasks immediately and with high accuracy, the quality as well as the productivity of the product making process could be significantly improved by the use of these machines. Additionally, intelligent robots will help to reduce the labor force needed, which contributes to the cutting down on the amount of money paid for the employees and therefore increasing the company's profit. Ċ On the other hand, this kind of human beings substitution may increase the unemployment rate. As the machines can perform efficiently, the need for manpower will be dramatically reduced. There might be only vacancies for highly trained technicians who can operate the up-to-date machines and those people who are not access to such high level of education will face the risk of not being employed in a long time. Ċ To conclude, although intelligent automatic machines have some drawbacks, I believe the benefits are more significant. Furthermore, there are many jobs such as crafting, porcelain making or designing which can only be done manually, so it is hard to say robots can entirely substitute human workforce in any way."
10184,"With the coming of new mass communication media like television and internet, newspaper is losing its importance. Do you agree with this or not?","The last century has witnessed a multitude of technological advances. Just a few decades back, newspapers and radio were the only means through which people could keep track of current affairs. The advent of novel mass communication media like television and the internet has completely changed this scenario. So, I second the statement that our time-tested newspapers are now losing their importance. Ċ Firstly, the invention of television in the 1990s was a milestone in itself. Families throughout the world could now sit together in front of one box and watch their favourite movies and songs. Also, the audio-visual representation of the daily headlines would be delivered straight into their living rooms. Consequently, media of written communication fell behind in this race. For instance, many magazines and comic book agencies went bankrupt over this time. Ċ Secondly, with the turn of the millennium, internet access became universal. Slowly and steadily, cellular data and mobile phones became cheaper. As a result, people in many of the low-income countries could also afford to buy cell phones. This caused an upheaval in the communication industry. New York Times, for example, could now be read at the click of a button. Additionally, people could access the breaking news on the go and at their own convenience.   Ċ In conclusion, I strongly agree with the fact that printed forms of mass media have lost their significance over time. Hence, most of the newspapers have now made their electronic versions available for subscription. Also, I believe that these forms of information will completely replace the pre-existing ones in the near future."
10185,"Some people t getting a degree from university is the best way to guarantee a good job, others believe that it would be better to go straight into work and get experience instead. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Ways to indicate one's goal of life have raised quite a concern at home and abroad. Some individuals consider it is better to obtain experiences from work than those who believe that college is a more trustworthy approach to have a good job. In my opinion, it is necessary to discuss inherent details on both sides first and lead to a plausible conclusion. Ċ On one hand, some believe attending colleges are a way to guarantee a good job. To begin with, after undergoing harsh academic training, people may be transferred into more mature individuals, possessing further insight for pursuing their goal of life that might lead to having a good job. For instance, due to experience difficult academic training systems, people may find themselves much easier to come up with more complex dimensions of ways of thinking. Therefore, applying their ideologies to a wide spectrum of difficulties in future life. Another inherent reason is that attending universities are the most stable avenue to step into their career and even reach their life targets compare to those who haven't been through study institutions. People may also receive a guarantee of a degree for applying for a better job moreAccept comma additionjob, more easily, which can influence their life in a long-lasting way. Ċ On the other hand, some people may find themselves being constrained to social systems, forcing them to undergo a long process of academic institutions that may be incompatible to them for learning. Thus, choosing to step into a harsh social atmosphere where they can get experiences quicker. For example, people can gain knowledge and certain techniques which universities won't teach and may find themselves more flexible with the liberty to take a glance at distinctive career realms. However, despite having a myriad of advantages, this practice can possess some drawbacks, such as not having innovations of thinking to deal with all kinds of puddles and may pose a risk for themselves to hop into an unfamiliar world that they are not used to. Ċ To conclude, in my view, instead of having experiences through jobs at a young age, I consider it is more essential to attend universities for a guarantee of life ranging from the benefits of being more mature and having a more stable avenue for a better living."
10186,"TOPIC:- Crime is a problem all over the world. Some believe that crime prevention will make no difference, others disagree. Discuss both the views and give your opinion. ways to reduce the criminal activities","Nowadays, crime is a serious issue across all parts of the world. Some people think that preventive e measures can control criminal activities. However, there are a few who are not in an agreement with this thought. This essay will discuss both the views followed by my opinion. Ċ Preventive actions, like efficient security system, strict and inevitable punishments against any unlawful activities, etc. will lower down the frequency of criminal activities. People would develop a sense of fear and restrict themselves to commit crime. It has been observed that the crime rate is subsequently lower in the countries where there are strict rules and punishments against the criminals as compared to other countries. Moreover, advanced safety measures, like installation of CCTV cameras, screening of people in public places, patrolling of police officers at crowded places etc. will prohibit people to indulge in any malpractices. As a result, the crime rate will be reduced, leading to a secure environment. Ċ However, there are a few who think that the preventive measures will not have any significant impact in controlling the criminal activities. They feel that no controls can stop a mentally-ill person to commit a crime. As these people lack an understanding between good and bad things. They unintentionally indulge themselves in the criminal activities without realizing its consequences. Moreover, people after consuming drugs tend to lose control over their senses resulting in unlawful activities which lead to dreadful outcomes. Ċ In my opinion, although there are some unintentional criminal activities for which there are limited control mechanism, proactive measures should be put in place as it will lower down the crime rate to a large extent. Henceforth, providing a safe place for individuals. Ċ To conclude, preventive controls, like proactive safety measures, stringent punishment will drastically reduce the criminal activities around the world."
10187,"These days, many people prefer ready –to-eat food outside of their home rather than home-made food. Do you think this have more advantages than disadvantages.","Modern life is fast paced and people often do not have enough time to cook their meals at home. Therefore, many opt for ready-made meals to save time and effort. However, I believe that this type of food has a negative health impact, and this makes their drawbacks outweigh their advantages. Ċ It is undoubted that ready-to-eat meals provide easy and quick alternative to home-cooked meals. This type of food products sold cooked, processed and packaged and do not need much preparation. Sandwiches, salad, pizza, soup, and noodles are examples of popular ready-made meals that can be found on supermarkets’ shelves. Furthermore, these precooked meals last longer than fresh food and can be frozen and stored for several days. For instance, my aunt Mary usually has some ready meals in her refrigerator, and use them when she does not have time to cook dinner. Ċ On the other hand, ready meals can have a damaging effects on health. First, they contain a high level of salt and saturated fat, which are linked to hypertension and heart diseases. A previous report by the WHO showed that 80% of precooked food products in the market contain more than the daily recommended amount of salt. Moreover, ready-to-eat meals are often composed of highly processed food that have been stripped of his nutrients. The amount of minerals and vitamins in these products is very low compared with fresh food and home-cooked repasts. For example, a can of vegetable soup will far less nutrients than a vegetable soup cooked at home from fresh ingredients. Ċ To conclude, I believe that the shortcomings of ready –to-eat meals are far more than their advantages. They are less healthy than home –prepared meals and contain more salt and fat."
10188,Write about the following topic: To what extent should economic planning be influenced by the need of environmental conservation?  Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Recently, there has been a contentious debate between different political and social groups of whether the environment damage is serious or acceptable to the international laws but one thing that is indisputable is that environmental pollution is horribly increasing and nothing has been done to counter the problem -- both objectively and economically. Ċ While the government authorities are cognizant of the fact that environmental pollution is on the rise but since most of them are produced by large multi-national corporations and is a source of large tax revenues; they are faced with a difficult dilemma. Hence, they are irresolute and much time is wasted debating on whether they should give up large amounts of tax revenues to cure the environmental problem or keep earning tax revenues so that they spend more on developing the economy by improving the infrastructures and so forth. Ċ From a scientific standpoint, I believe that it is crucial to alleviate the environmental pollution and remain oblivious to the tax revenues that it will lose because what good is earning an income if people can't live in a suitable environment? Ċ However, from an economic perspective such reckless draconian measures can cause huge problem for the economy because what good is of living in an environmental-friendly place where people will lose jobs from the big corporations and die of hunger? Ċ Therefore to conclude, I think both the tax revenues and environmental pollution should be brought together and compromised so that taxes are earned and also people live in a suitable environment where few pollutions are tolerated if not completely eradicated."
10189,Some believe that people should not continue to work one they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from experience.,"Few individuals advocate that there should no age of retirement and old people should be permitted to work, if they can. Personally, I believe that there should be a certain age of retirement, and I will shed light on my viewpoint in the next few paragraphs. Ċ To begin with, there are only a few advantages of not setting an age of retirement. The old population would have fewer financial constraints if they keep on working until their feasibilities. Furthermore, they can give positive input to society by utilizing their experience and knowledge. For instance, if the old people continue work, they can transfer their knowledge to young workers. Meanwhile, the old people can keep themselves busy which will minimize the incidents of Add an article a The noun phrase loneliness seems to be missing a determiner before it. Consider adding an article. Ċ show examplesloneliness induced psychiatric disorder including, anxiety, depression and psychosis. Ċ On contrary, there are enormous benefits of limiting the age of working. First and foremost, it is a natural phenomenon, with advancing ages, individuals’ learning and performing capabilities gradually decline, so the old people should stop working after a specific age. This is equally good for individual and social and economic level. Secondly, the companies would have young efficient and energetic employees rather than old ones. Last but not least, this approach would create spaces for new diligent workers. For example, if a chief executive officer of an organization serves so long then the organization policies will become static and this would have devastating consequences. Ċ To conclude, the limit of the working ages are set in most of the nations around the world. I think that it is a quite sensible development which is preventing society from going into turmoil. It is the need of the hour to increase the pensions so that elders would not have any financial issue."
10190,"Some people think exposure to modern technology at an earlier age is good for children, while others claim that it is harmful to their development. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","Currently, New Technology has been increased rapidly all over the world soon it's going to replace toys with electronic gadgets. It is believed by human beings that disclosure of modern technology at an initial period for kids is useful but others feel that it will eradicate their growth. This essay will argue both views with suggestions. I, totally agree with the statement that it will destroy their progress more rapidly. Ċ First of all, At an early duration, children will become intelligent, may develop the ability to understand the situation and to deal with it. Moreover, they become independent to resolve the matter on their own. They develop the ability to interact socially. It not only improves their communication skills but also it may be improved their imagination power. For example, During the pandemic, adults, as well as children, started playing games related to their various fields like maths, funny games on mobile phones which not only increases their skills but also will increase their ability to deal with it. Ċ On the other hand, kids will ruin their lives by the usage of electronic devices. likewise, they will develop certain diseases at an early age like obesity, sleep deprivation, eye infection, certain health conditions, Which may result in damage to their physical nature. Furthermore, they will become violent and stubborn. Nowadays, they have a minimum time to play outside which results in the deficiency of VitaminD. For instance, The Who release the document stating that using of electronic devices have been increasing during childhood which results in harm to their lives. Ċ In conclusion, Devices should be controlled by elder ones who can guide them. phones, the lab tops should be given only during their classes. Parents should motivate their teenagers to read books, magazines to improve their skills. I feel that every child is using these gadgets but guidance to deal with them."
10191,Some people think that a person improves their intellectual skills more when doing group activities. To what extent do you agree? Use specific details and examples to explain your view.,"In recent decades, many researchers have studied the importance of team-level cognition. Society activities are beneficial by different groups of people. Indeed, to my mind, there is now convincing evidence that group activities improve the intelligence of individuals. In this essay, I shall examine how research in team-games and study-groups supports this view. Ċ To begin with, team-games clearly require individuals to perform a diverse range of rapid mental calculations. This is because, in a sporting context, players must predict and anticipate possible actions within tight time constraints. For example, a recent Cambridge study showed that soccer players can – within the span of seconds – calculate over a dozen different permutations that could result from a single soccer related action. Such predictive powers clearly improve players’ mental abilities and result from activities performed in a group context. Ċ Secondly, team-groups enable individuals to obtain information that they could not acquire in isolation. This is because peer feedback allows individuals to refine their understanding of concepts and to also learn new information from other members in the study-group. For example, a study by The British Institute for Learning found that, if individuals participated in the study-groups, they had a far more objective and sophisticated understanding of a topic than learners who were not part of study-groups. Therefore, it is certainly the case that learning in a group improves an individual’s mental abilities. Ċ In conclusion, I strongly agree with the notion that team activities improve intellectual abilities. In the future, we will certainly see schools take greater measures to ensure that more group-level cognition occurs in the classroom."
10192,Some people argue that space exploration has had more to do with national pride than international effort. To what extent do you agree with this? How do you think space exploration will change in the future? space exploration prestige,"Space travel is no longer a dream today's. As seen, many people can go to outside the Earth due to the sophisticated technology. However, some people believe that such activity should be done with national pride rather while i personally argue that space exploration brings countries together so as to reach particular purpose, exploring space. Ċ Needless to say, space exploration become a place for several countries to compete in the advanced of technology since they want to impress others by rising flag on the moon or particular planet and exploring space. According to proffesor Lambert, a lecturer in Harvard University, states that not every country can travel to outside space, so it would be national pride when a country can send their local people to the space, like America, for instance. As a result, others will regard its as a powerful country. However, in my opinion, it would be better if such space project is carried out together with other countries. Ċ Apart from previous discussion, the reason why space exploration becomes international effort is not only the high cost to carry out this project but also the lack of equipment. A recent 2012 MIT University research reveals that 20 countries in this world invest their money and do research together to develop rocket space to another planet with Uni Soviet supplies rocket equipment regularly. As a result, many people have a high chance to go to the space in the future since their country get involved in this projects, so they can get the opportunity easily. Ċ The aforementioned evidence shows that space exploration is no longer done with national pride. However, more countries should take a part in this project due to the paramount of importance knowing the space. Where possible, a strong commitment from country is needed in order to make its successfully."
10193,prompt: The number of people who are at risk of serious health problems due to being overweight is increasing. What is the reason for the growth in overweight people in society? How can this problem be solved? changing bad habits may save your life,"Scientific findings have clearly indicated that overweight or obesity leading to a lot of serious health problems. There are a number of reasons causing this problem and each problem needs to be dealt in a particular way. Ċ It can be seen that the main factor of overweight is lack of exercises. Nowaday people spend too much time on working from early morning to late night and free time with friends. In addition, the increase of fast foods, junk foods and soft drink which are unhealthy foods. The busy life makes people can not cook then they use fast food to save time. However, some studies demonstrated the effect of poor sleep to overweight. Because hormones that are released during sleep control appetite and the body's use. Overweight will lead to the majority of health risks such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes and so on. Ċ It is important that action is taken to combat these problems. Firstly, the government has a duty to take necessary step to over come at every stages. Secondly, eating fast food as least as possible and cooking healthy diets for the family especially children. Finally, doing exercises every day to keep healthy. Ċ In conclusion, overweight and obesity are the risk problems in recent decades. However, it can be death with changing bad habits."
10194,It has been noted that many people who had a big impact on the world gave themselves completely to their work and did not bother with the idea of “work-life balance”. To what extent should people try to have a good work-life balance? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.,"A lot of people who significantly impacted the world devoted their whole time to their work and did not pay attention to a recently invented term work-life balance. I think that in a modern world it is necessary for everyone to effectively split and manage their time because it is highly unlikely that without a proper work-life balance one will attain high results and become happy. Ċ First of all, harmony in any sphere of life is essential for staying active and motivated. A jobless person without an engaging challenging job might lose a desire to live as inner energy is not used or wasted on useless activities. Also, it is often noted that people who involved in a job that may change others' lives are happier and more satisfied. In other words, without work, most individuals may feel unsatisfied and depressed. For instance, some surveys claim that many young volunteers feel happier than their peers because they see positive results and feedback from their work. Ċ Furthermore, a good work-life balance prevents some hard-working employees from overwork. Overworking may lead to burnout which is an underrated mental disorder. Moreover, the number of people facing this issue is constantly rising around the globe. However, if a person properly organizes his work and rest hours, this problem is highly likely to be avoided. For example, a recent article from Google about the performance of their employees mentioned that workers who passed a specifically designed course about work and life balance significantly increased their productivity. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that every person should pay close attention to the time spent on work and do not neglect their personal time. I would recommend reading popular literature about work-life balance and integrate the ideas as early as possible."
10195,Many people like to wear fashionable clothes. Ċ Why do you think this is the case ? Ċ Is this a good thing or a bad thing ?,"Folks prefer to get on nifty costumes to show up their beauty so that they can get a privilege to the people. The foremost reason for this is to be popular and famous to the persons so that they can get mental satisfaction. From my perspective, this is not a good thing at all. Ċ It seems undeniable that man has to go to many places to know the condition of a region. As a consequence, he or she must concentrate on that work. Lack of monitoring any tasks create a harmful effect which might occur sufficient trouble for the concerned area personnel. On the contrary, some individuals consider that to impress oneself or everybody fashionable dresses should be required. To create a good impact stylish costume mark someone in a well prestigious view. For instance, to visit road construction it is very important to know the situation of that place and quantity of materials. However, if a folk wears a gorgeous dress it would help him to bias any employee to accomplish the work in a very short time. Ċ Moreover, to create a good looking appropriate behave is the best. To demonstrate, if someone talks very well it would be possible to present himself to others as a perfect man. When somebody faces with his seniors or accustomed persons, he must implement good behaviour which is sufficient to impress anyone. On the other hand, some folks consider if a person wears nifty clothes he can bias his upper-level people easily because seeing the first impression would be good at that time. For example, if somebody attends one's party like a marriage ceremony, festivals etcetera he can entertain the entire environment with his good gesture. Nevertheless, joining in a ceremony to wear fashionable clothes it would be easy to create an eye on the specific persons. Ċ In conclusion, man is known by his works, not his stylish dress up. Besides this nifty costume would be needed to run any systems faster."
10196,Write about the following topic. Ċ A person’s health is their own responsibility rather than the government’s responsibility. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.,"The authority has partial responsibility for any individual's health because they have to provide enough medical care structure to cope with the increasing number of people. However, I believe that everyone has to take care of his health by a regular exercising and healthy dietary scheme. Ċ On the one hand, the government has to enhance the quality of the medical care structure. This is because of the increase in population in every place, which requires the authority to multiply the number of hospitals. For instance, in Egypt, every year, the population increases by around 2 million people; therefore, the government has to increase the sum of hospitals. Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of each one to take his precautions to maintain his health by going to the hospital every few months to do a full check-up. Ċ On the other hand, people should adopt a healthy lifestyle to improve their health. This is because a balanced diet system could enhance the body metabolism. For instance, everyone should take enough portions of meat, vegetables and protein to increase the body burning. Furthermore, nothing is helpful more than exercising regularly; for example, if anyone spend 30 minutes in jogging every day, this will improve the body mass. As a result, it is evident that these procedures will prevent any health-related issues such as cardiovascular diseases. Ċ In conclusion, while the government has to provide an adequate number of hospitals, it is the responsibility of individuals to go to hospitals for a regular check-up, adopt a healthy diet scheme and physical activities."
10197,"Question : In recent years, there has been a considerable rise in crimes committed by young people in cities. What has caused this? What solutions can you suggest?","These days, there is a significant rise in criminals among young people. This is a pressing issue across the world and needs immediate attention. Ċ There are various reasons for the increase in crimes among young people. One main reason for this change is movies. These days most of the movies show violence and are portraying criminals are heroes resulting in provocation of young to take wrong paths. The second reason is due to busy modern lives, parents are not spending considerable time with their kids. As no one is correcting their wrong doings, they are turning out into criminals. The third reason is, due increase in standard of living across the world, parents are able to give more pocket money to their children. Most of the youth these days are getting used to drugs and alcohol. Ċ There is certainly on one solution to this problem, considering the complexity of the causes. However, the government can impose laws in sensor board to make sure movies which impact society in a bad way are banned. It would also help if parents can spend more time with their children teaching them good manners and monitoring them regularly, so that they don't get used to drugs and alcohol. It is also proven that children who spend time with their grand parents are less likely to turn into criminals. The government should also pass legislation which would restrict access to guns among youth which is also a major concern these days. Ċ To sum up, young people are turning into criminals because of the changes in life style in twentieth century. Government and parents should work together to guide youth in the right direction."
10198,"in recent years life has become more stressful than it has ever been, As a consequence more and more people are sifferig from stress-related pron[blmes.What factors are contributing to this increase and what do yout think can be done to overcome the current problems.","Life has many phases and stress is one of them. In the past few ,years life is extra tensed than it was used to being. This leads to more stress-related troubles. There are various causes for this problem, which I will discuss further in this essay along with the ways to reduce them. Ċ In my perspective, there could be numerous reason for the increase in tension among people. Firstly, the work environment these days are rapid, which increases workload. The excessive amount of work and less time to complete create tension. To complete the target people sacrifice their sleep which compromises the functioning of the brain . Secondly, nowadays most of the workers stay away from home to work and earn money. They lack personal touch with family members and their loved ones. Having no one close to share problems makes them suffer alone. Another reason could be the impatient behaviour of people toward each other. For ,instance in times like now when the world is hit with a pandemic like COVID, everyone wants to be first in the line to get their work done. Patience is lost in this chaos and stress is rising at high levels. Ċ However, there are ways to conquer this issue like people need to relax. I believe that a stress-free work environment should be created and, mental health awareness programs can be run by companies to help their employees. Apart from that ,they can do exercises like yoga to calm themselves. It is proved that medication like yoga is effective to reduce tension. Other than that, it is good to have a proper routine for the sleep and wake cycle because sleep is important for the clear processing of thoughts. Moreover, people can try talking out their worries with their friends and family. Ċ To conclude, mental peace should be the first priority of every individual and it is their responsibility to maintain it. Not letting the negativity around affect you is the beginning of everything."
10199,"The consumption of the world’s resources (oil, and water, etc.) is increasing at a dangerous rate. What are the causes and solutions?","It is true that natural resources depletion is severely detrimental to the socio-economic development of a nation due to uncontrolled overconsumption proportion of non-renewable sources of energy. There are a number of justifications behind this point of view and several solutions should be proposed accordingly to alleviate the harmful effects of this phenomenon. Ċ On the one hand, there are two primary reasons why these resources are being utilized excessively. The first one is that world resources are greatly beneficial to the socio-economic development of a country. For example, policies related to the inventions of electric cars and unmanned aeroplanes using environmentally-friendly energy are adopted, though, there is no sound substitute for gasoline and diesel as a major supply of fuels for modes of transportation. In addition, oil and coal are still irreplaceable materials in order to fulfil the requirements of complicated procedures in factories. Another reason is that seeking for replaceable substances requires more expenses from national and local authorities. Alternative sources of energy such as solar and wind power are strongly taken into consideration as the potential replacement for fossil fuels, however, due to their proper characteristics, it is giving more funds that serve for producing useful equipment to convert solar and wind power into energy. Ċ On the other hand, measures should be taken by not only by governments and but also international bodies to decelerate consumption of the world’s resources. Firstly, restrictions should be introduced at a larger scale so as not to waste resources. For instance, citizens will not be allowed to leave the water running in their own houses if they go outside. Besides, people’s awareness of utilizing electricity effectively should be raised, especially during rush hours. Secondly, multinational corporations should cooperate with each other for the purpose of mitigating natural resources depletion. It is imperative that they set up international bodies and fundraise for these organizations to prioritize expenditure on some certain projects related to alternative energy sources. This contributes a reduction in the rate of consumption of non-renewable resources. Ċ In conclusion, it is clear that there are various justifications for people’s increased proportion of using the world’s resources and steps should be taken to tackle this problem."
10200,"Education is a critical element to prosperity of any nation. The more educated the people in country are, the more successful their nation becomes. Discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with this statement.","With the advent of technological advancements, the modern world has undergone a rapid transformation. In my opinion, with quality education nations are developing at a fast rate and therefore are more successful than others. Ċ The foremost example to support the above-mentioned view is that of the high economic growth rate of countries with extensive learning facilities. For example, if we talk about the countries which have relatively high per capita income or GDP have high literacy rates as well. Clearly, education has been playing an important role in the success of the country. Ċ The second example that explains my opinion is that of innovations in medical facilities. A developed country like USA or UK is certainly able to handle or control an epidemic in a better way as compared to the countries which are still under-developed like some African countries. So certainly education is needed for the nations to overcome such contingencies. Ċ The third example that illustrates my opinion is how quickly a nation recovers from natural disasters like floods or earthquakes with the aid of latest technologies. Educated people are more aware of the warnings given by forecast departments and are equipped with the means to minimize the damage. Consequently, the whole disaster management system is a result of better educational facilities. Ċ Finally to conclude, we can see there are numerous examples where well-developed educational system is playing a vital role in the progress of  a country. Without educated people a country is not only doomed to fail economically but in other areas of growth as well."
10201,"Culture around the world has become more similar to the other countries then it was before. State reasons, example and conclude if it is a positive or negative trend?","Civilization across the globe has become more common to other nations as compared to the past. In my opinion, this is a positive trend for the following reasons. Ċ First and foremost, common culture eliminates the communication barriers thus results in increased trade and commerce. In the past, countries were dependent on each other for seasonal vegetable and fruits but now just because the culture is becoming progressively similar, people are not only able to exchange their methods and techniques but also becoming self-dependent. Additionally, this has brought several countries closer to each other, as a result of which nations are able to resolve their conflicts through communication. For example, India and Pakistan are enemies as nations but their citizens share friendly relations because of the common culture. Ċ Secondly, another reason why similar civilization advantageous because this is benefiting the most under-developed countries. For instance, a recent survey conducted by The British Government found that 40% of the employment is generated in developing regions due to this advancement of civilization. Moreover, this broadens the outlook of the people and helps to make them aware of what development is going on at the international level. Ċ To conclude, in my opinion, this is a positive trend and this should be continued for the betterment of mankind. This is necessary to build a civilized world where one can understand and respect the diverse heritage of others and I think individuals and the government should work together in this venture. so that our future generations will be more sensitive and have a good sense of fraternity."
10202,You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Ċ Write about the following topic. Ċ Some say that it would be better if the majority of employees worked from home instead of travelling to a workplace every day. Ċ Do you think the advantages of working from home outweigh the disadvantages? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Ċ You should write at least 250 words.,"Some people opine that this is more suitable for workforces to work at home rather than commuting to their workplace every day. From my point of view ,I completely believe this could have more drawbacks instead of advantages. I'm going to explain some of them below. Ċ Firstly ,one of the main downsides is becoming lazy. For example ,when people are allowed to conduct their operations at home ,they may decide to do these later. This could cause there is no denying that the chances to meet deadlines will be reduced . Another drawback is possessing just their own ideas. Humans may want to present diverse ideas in order to construct a better situation at work ,however, they do not have any relationship with their colleagues at home. This would create fewer ideas about these items. Therefore ,this makes it clear why this content could be harmful and could have multiple disadvantages. Ċ Secondly ,apart from downsides ,this has benefits. For example ,in most developed countries around the world ,the population are working at their accommodation in 21 century. This means they have all the mod cones and technological gadgets to conduct their projects. This probably could create a noticeable space in their works. Additionally ,the employees regularly have chances to do other types of activities such as cleaning their homes. As a result ,it becomes apparent there are numerous benefits behind each disadvantage that we can not ignore. Ċ To summarise ,I personally believe that this issue has more drawbacks that humans can not escape from them. It is predicted that to continue this activity most workplaces will be closed in the near future."
10203,"""The desire of corporations to maximize profits creates conflict with the general welfare of the nation at large. "" Discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the opinion stated above. Support your views with reasons and/or examples from your own experience, observations or reading.","The statement links welfare of the nation and the desire of corporations to maximize profits. When one considers these two entities, one can see that they are intermingled. The corporations and their actions have an extensive impact on the general welfare of nation. The impact however, may be positive or negative depending on the type of action. Ċ When we consider the action of maximizing profit, one may say that it will hamper the national welfare. The reason being, while maximizing profits, corporations have to sideline important aspects such as national benefit, safety. When corporations take a path for their own development and profit, they tend to prioritize in an order where national welfare is at the lower end of the queue. Ċ However, one may argue that the maximizing of profits by corporations will after all help to improve the national economy. As profits earned increase, so will the national wealth. When profits are maximized, the benefits are received by a lucky few. What reaches the masses is still the same. The overall welfare of the nation is jeopardized. Ċ I conclude by saying that increasing profits is going to benefit the nation only to a certain extent. A desire to maximize profits beyond that extent will only conflict with the national welfare. Hence, corporations have to consider these factors before taking any actions."
10204,Topic: Schools should focus more on teaching students how to be successful in the workforce and less on helping them to achieve academic success. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In this day and age, we are living in a world where issues of education-related is a heated topic and often discussed. It is commonly believed that school education should focus more on the skills which lead to the success of the students rather than only improving their academic performance. In my opinion, both success-oriented teaching and academic achievements could go together to help students be more successful in the future. Ċ Today's world is a very competitive place. Everyone is in the race to get prosperous by either getting a highly paid job or by starting their own successful business. For example, a person cannot become a good designer by reading textbooks and applying theoretical knowledge such as formulas and equations. So, they should get taught about vocational skills like painting, crafting, visual elements, and principles. Also, regular workshops should be organized at school to teach them the value of team bonding, cooperation, and effective communication skills. In other words, a lot of things are required to be successful in life apart from books. Ċ On the other hand, we cannot underestimate the role of academic courses. Such courses lay a solid foundation for their knowledge and they can understand basic things in life with ease. For instance, school subjects help in enhancing their aptitude and verbal abilities. Moreover, recruiters always look for outstanding academic records while hiring employees. Hence, school studies also contribute in a positive manner. Ċ In conclusion, a person's future career success, to a certain extent, is still influenced by his or her academic performance at school so it is rather reckless to jump to an absolute conclusion on which educational philosophy should be consistently held."
10205,Nowadays many young people are attracted to dangerous sports such as snowboarding or mountain biking. What makes these sports so attractive? What measures should be taken to minimize the risks? Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"High adrenaline sport is increasingly becoming a craze with the younger population. These days, kids are attracted to riskier activities like snow skiing and mountain biking. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons for their addiction in these sports and the regulations that are required to be taken to keep everyone involved safe. Ċ In fact, there are many reasons which attract these young minds to various dangerous sports. Firstly, it is associated with higher energy, that can attract a huge number of children. For example, it is widely known that teenagers are attracted to high intensity sports rather than slow progressing ones. Secondly, the kids get thrilled as it contains requirements of higher speed like mountain skiing, formula car racing. Finally, the kids in these generations like trying out new things, which their grandparents were never able to try out. Thus, mainly because of the huge involvement of greater speed, energy teenagers are lured to these dangerous sports. Ċ Having said that, ensuring their safety and safeguarding the interests of the country's young minds are something that the authorities needs to take, by minimising their risk to health and life. Not only do the federal department needs to bring regulations in place, but also need to check its adherence by the parties regularly. For instance, it is an accepted fact that because of the rules and constant supervision of the Australian Maritime Ministry, they were able to significantly lessen the accidents of the sea surfers in Australia. Additionally, the government could tax these activities more so that the frequency of their participation would gradually go down. Ċ To conclude, even though the kids these days are increasingly getting involved in dangerous activities, there are methods that can be adopted to lower its impact. Further, as more and more youth gets addicted to these adventurous ways, the government need to take measures to abolish them."
10206,"It is commonly believed that nowadays main factors that affect a child's development are media, pop culture and friends. A different point of view is that family plays the most significant role. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Some people believe that a child's development is affected by surrounding factors like Journalism, western culture and peers; diametrically opposed to this, others opine that in the upbringing of a toddler, family plays an indispensable role to pass cultural values. Although both sides have an equally compelling argument, I am personally inclined towards the second notion. Ċ First and foremost, with the advancement of technology, youngsters are more tender to fall into the trap of digital media. At that age, they could not be realised what is real and what is an illusion and they tend to copy their favourite film stars, in the way of speaking and action. The high exposer to digital media has influenced offspring's personality to great extent. Apart from that the fellows and journalism like magazines and newspapers also have made a great impact on adolescents' growth. Ċ However, the rearing of an infant is the prime responsibility of the family. Both parents pulled their best to teach the cultural value and the significance of rituals to the juvenile. For instance,parents educate the child how to respect elders and treat others equally indifferences of social status and skin colour. Besides, a youngster has received the most valuable information by watching and following their family members. Thus, the family guides their offspring in either direct or indirect ways. Ċ To conclude then, whilst there exist contrasting stances on the matter. It is taxing work to decide which argument may have a more positive impact. I personally believe, parents are the best friends and mentors to affect a kid's personality as they have had a relation with toddlers since birth."
10207,Many people today do not feel safe either at home or when they are out. Ċ What are the causes?What are the solutions?,"In this modern era,several individuals feel insure or in danger when they are at their house or when they are outside their home.There are myriad reasons behind this which include economic and social factors.Firstly,this essay will discuss the reasons which make people feel unsafe and in the latter half,will explore feasible solutions. Ċ To commence with,the first and foremost cause is nowadays newspapers are splashed with crime-related news which creates hustle and bustle in the lives of the reader,this has created a feeling of insecurity for the society.For instance, the Health care centres department has displayed their data which depicts that individuals these days are stressed as well as health problems like depression could be commonly observed because of the news and the social media they watch which depicts the ongoing criminal activities occurring in the society.As a result,individuals neither feel safe at their home nor feel safe at their workplace or some other area. Ċ Every lock has a key.Similarly,this issue could be tackled in numerous ways like the government must take strict actions to provide safety to the citizens,which will not only lead to the development of a country but also will diminish health-related issues.For example,the United Nations has ensured its citizens that in case of robbery allow the thief to steal whatever they can the country will compensate the loss.This is the feasible solution that will make the citizens feel secure when they are at their home or outside. Ċ In conclusion, the mental stress level of an individual is a big problem in this era in spite of taking medication and other remedies it has been enhanced because of the increase in crime rate which is a major issue of the society,it leads to instability among the individuals thus to overcome this fear the government should take all relevant steps to provide safety and to reduce the unethical activities which will make people live freely both in their homes and in an outside location."
10208,Why do you think some people are attracted to dangerous sports or other dangerous activities ? What make people engaging in risky activities?,"Many people like common sports and activities bringing a fit health. However, some people are keen on playing dangerous sports for three main reasons: seeking new experiences, clearing away the negative mood and showing that they are brave, confident and strong. Ċ The first reason why some people are interested in dangerous sports or activities is that wishing to seek new experiences. These people often feel curiously with activities they have never joined before. Therefore, they would like to play to experience new feelings such as extreme excitement or scary. Ċ Another reason is that the dangerous sports help people reduce the negative feelings such as stress and sadness. For example, when people are under a high pressure they wish to experience the dangerous activities so as to forget it. Therefore, these activities bring people a more comfortable and happier mood. Ċ Finally, people enjoy playing dangerous sports as they want to show that they are brave, confident and strong. Some people especially the young join these sports to show friends their particular ability. For example, they often take photos to record the moments they play dangerous sports and then post them on the social network for showing. The young is really happy when having compliments from their friends. Ċ In conclusion, a large number of people adore joining dangerous sports or other dangerous activities due to looking for new experiences, relaxing and showing themselves. However, I think people should consider carefully before joining this kind of sports because it might endanger their life."
10209,The children who grow up in a family short of money are more capable of dealing with problems in adult life than children who are brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Indeed, one of the most influential element in children's personal development is family background. Obviously, some people believe that the children who grow up in an impoverished family are less likely to solve issues which face them during adolescence while others think that the adults who are nurtured by an affluent family have many more opportunities to solve troubles during their teenage years. Ċ In my opinion, individual's problem-solving ability comes from the knowledge which is obtained during his or her adolescence. In fact, children from poor families face problems during their education. The reason for this is sometimes parents do not want to give their children to reputable schools because of indigent family income. Moreover, some parents order to their children to earn money from an early age. Because of their destitute knowledge, they do not have ability to solve difficulties. Ċ On the other hand, children who highly-educated and affluent are more likely to find solution to their problems. In my view, they are not only better off economically but also they can easily take access from others. It is true that if we compare well-off adults with impoverished children, children from wealthy family have a lot of chances in problem-solving. In a nutshell, they are at an advantage in harass-solving. Ċ To sum up, I want to mention that children who from an affluent family can also attend social meetings, parties freely, and, there they improve their life skills and social contact. In addition I would like to add extra point that parents need provide their children with needed things."
10210,"Some individuals think that working from home, while of benefit to employees, is actually a drawback to employers. To what extent, do you agree or disagree?","Because of the pandemic, the world is upgrading their working method from traditional ""office"" method to ""remote work"" mode and according to several people, employers or companies loses their value or benefits in working from the home system which I completely disagree.Change preposition with.It seems that preposition use may be incorrect here. Ċ show examples Ċ The employer gets plenty of advantages when employees are working remotely such as a reduction in the cost of the workplace or rental office. The employer can save thousands of dollars from centre rent, electricity bills, wifi charges, and many more miscellaneous charges. This means that employers can spend less money on workplace furniture and supplies. The researchers said that the USA employers save up to $1 Million from leasing a workstation in the 2020's pandemic. For example, the company can save $48,000 in one year if the workplace's rent is $4000 per month. Ċ Many associations provide remote jobs and also save money because they see higher productivity rates, meaning that their staff produce more and provide better results while working from home. Moreover, executives see workers working retention and find out that they can work more than 8 hours while they working remotely. Furthermore, personnel get a perfect balance between their professional life and personal life which increases their attention to detail, adaptability, and makes them dependable. The survey shows that American companies got 98% of positive responses from workers who work remotely in 2021. Ċ In conclusion, the companies get the most benefits for instance office expenses reduction, higher employee retention, and increased employees productivity rate in remote working methods. Although, workers may have a few drawbacks like losing willpower, lack of motivation, burnout, etc."
10211,"Over the last few decades, there has been an increase in international tourism. Ċ Some people think that tourism is beneficial for local communities and should Ċ be encouraged. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is a steady rise in the growth of the travel industry from past times. Few people believe that the tourist industry is profitable for the local communities and needs to be pushed. On the positive side tourist industry will help in the economic growth of a country. On the contrary, it has an appalling effect on the local society. In my opinion, I strongly agree to motivate the industry. Ċ On the one hand, the Tourist industry will help in raising the GDP of a country in so many ways. International tourism will help in creating so many new jobs like waiters in the hotels, establishment of new local shops and restaurants etc. In this ,way it will decrease the unemployment problem in a nation. Furthermore, the standard of living of the individuals also raises. In India, for example, the percentage of contribution by the international tourism industry to economic growth in 2015 is 10% which has been raised to 25% in 2020. This clearly explains to us, how International tourism will aid in the economic aspects of a country. Ċ On the other hand, the multi-national travel industry will have an appalling effect on the local traditions and culture. In particular, The younger generations will be easily attracted to western culture by leaving their customs. In addition, they even lose the basic essence of their traditions, customs and local language. A recent study, made by Stanford University students reveals that there is a huge decrease in the number of local languages spoken in Russia in the last 10 years, and this is due to global tourism. Ċ In conclusion, the inter-continental tourism industry has both advantages and disadvantages, but advantages overweigh the disadvantages. However, it is the responsibility of one's own nation to bring the laws or reforms to maintain the equalities of society and develop tourism."
10212,Some people think that internet is shrinking our world with its tremendous benefits. Others argue that it has major adverse consequences for the course of human civilization due to its negative effects on family relationship. Ċ Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.,"Technology is flourishing by its leaps and bounds in each and every field and internet plays a prominent role in the human generation. However, it has been argued that the internet is having more disadvantages in people life than the advantages. This essay will elicit upon both the elements then only I will give my own view. Ċ To embark on, through the internet, it is very convenient for an individual to connect their loved ones across the globe. furthermore, this world wide web aid in resolving various critical aspect of mass by keeping humanity in place. Additionally, communication technology catered numerous methods in students education by making it more approachable and easy. To exemplify, these days parents prefer their kids having higher education in a foreign nation, cause of availability of the easiest method of communication, whenever needed, through the platform such as what's app & Facebook video chats. Ċ On the other hand, with this automation there are a lot of ramifications has been observed. If the internet getting used wrongly, society has to bear a lot of negative reactions. Due to the accessibility of WWW people are now very addicted to this mechanism. In fact, in-person interaction has been plummet among the family members across the globe. Moreover, because of the lack of communication,there is a lot of conflict between the parents and children are remarked. To illustrate, though the family goes for outing and gathering, they found to be more engaged in their mobile phones instead of connecting with each other. Ċ To conclude, I firmly opine that the world can not function without internet and is paramount to this generation, although, one should know its limitation and right method of using it, without affecting the meaning of human life."
10213,Organized tours to remote areas and communities are increasingly popular. Is it a positive or negative development for the local people and the environment?,"It seems that a prevalent trend in tourism in recent years is the increasing popularity of visits to far-off places. I opine that given this tendency would benefit the residents in those destinations, it may do harm to the locality. Ċ On the one hand, inhabitants in the sites where tourists come could gain economic and cultural advantages. For starters, there will be more revenues coming to the places. As travellers come and stay at the tourist sites, they will certainly demand some basic services such as accommodation and catering. This can help local residents earn more money by providing such services, which in turn boost their living standards. In addition, it is the cultural exchange that inhabitants there can enjoy. Visitors nationwide and worldwide can introduce their customs to local people and at the same time learn the local’s by means of their visits. The process facilitates international understanding among people and helps boost love and passion for people in general. Ċ Granted, excessive tourist activities can cause damage to the sites’ surroundings. Surveys have shown that almost all places of interest are now under great criticism for the omnipresence of litter. Owing to this, many once-popular places have been turned back on by visitors. Moreover, when there are more people flocking to a place, the demand for transportation escalates accordingly. More flights or transport routes are established to accommodate this growing need, meaning that the volume of traffic also increases, and the definitive repercussion is the deterioration of the air quality. Ċ In conclusion, it is my belief that this trend of tourism defers considerable merits on local people, but gives rise to environmental degradation. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that the powers that be should take appropriate action to maximize the gains and minimize the losses."
10214,Many people think that interviews are not the best way to assess the suitability of a candidate for a position.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is a common impression that interviews are not the apt way to decide on the possibility of hiring a particular person for a particular job. This essay will provide an answer to the question of why I completely agree with this statement ? Ċ Firstly, it is impossible to understand the complete personality of a human being via a meeting like in the areas of analytical thinking, where a meeting may only give a vague description of the participant's thinking process. However, this cannot be the only best approach but it can be one of the indicators of hiring an individual. For instance, in an interview conducted by Google, the candidates were asked to fix a physical computer after it broke down. In this case, the practical test taken by the participant to solve the problem was recorded as the analytical ability of the person and virtues like loyalty to the company and attending office regularly were gauged using an interview. Therefore, it is recommended that an interview should not be only the step while recruiting a professional but it can play a part in the entire procedure of recruitment. Ċ Secondly, Nowadays people attend interviews with the goal of securing a job rather than providing information about their true behaviour.For example, we have seen some contestants of Miss World Competition 2017, who have declared that if they win the contest, then they would donate the prize money to the poor people of their country and after winning the prize, they chose not to donate that money. This is because the goal of participants is to win the contest rather than show their true character to the judges. So, without honesty, Interviews cannot be the right procedure to assess the suitability of an individual for a specific job. Ċ To conclude, I strongly support the idea that interviews are not the best way to assess the suitability of a candidate for a position. However, we can recommend that interviews should only be a part of the complete proceeding of hiring a candidate, just like written tests and group discussions."
10215,Some people are always in hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take time and live life in slow pace.,"Time is gold. Some people try to do their works in a short time, while others prefer to enjoy their time and live life at a slower pace. It seems to me that every moment of our lives is valuable and we should not waste it. Ċ Nowadays, we have a plenty of duties to do and they will be not finished. If we do not manage time to do our activities carefully, we may have done the job quickly and it leads to mistakes. Then we will have to do the job again. It will take time and as a result, we may get angry and will not enjoy our lives. By going more slowly, we can do a chore carefully and correctly. For an instance, one of my classmates, after the exam, he was so delighted because he thought that he could solve questions quickly and correctly. However, when the result come out in the board, his result was disappointing, because he made many errors during solving the problems. Thereby he failed, so he must take the course again. Ċ Some people think that they work very hard and quickly, because they can gain more money and would able to enjoy in the future. However, I disagree with these people because we do not know what happens in the future. By watching automobiles in the roads, we can watch many machines try to reach their destinations by high speed. As a result, unfortunately, some of them loose their lives in accidents. Ċ In conclusion, however, we need to manage time to reach our goals, but we should consider the results that may happen in the future. Doing our duties in a short time may cause troubles for us."
10216,"Topic: The private motor vehicle has greatly improved individual freedom of movement. Moreover, The automobile has become a status symbol. Yet, the use of private motor vehicle has contributed to some of today's most serious problems. How can the use of private motor vehicle be reduced?","In the today's modern era private motor vehicle has greatly improved individuals freedom by advancement in the automobiles. A person doing a reputed job want to use own vehicle for traveling and for their status symbol. Ċ People having own motor vehicle can go anywhere where they want to go without wasting the time on waiting for the buses or trains. As we know in our daily routine, time plays an important role, with the use of private vehicles people can save our time and do something creative rather than spending in the traveling. Ċ Although, Private motor vehicle is the status symbol for the people but on the other side it causes the problems that can not be avoidable. One of the most critical problem of increasing trend in private motor vehicle is decreasing the availability of nation's natural resources like fuel and diesel . The other problem is surge in the traffic . If the people traveling in their own motor vehicle got stuck in a traffic jam will take more time than using public transportation to reach their destination. Ċ The use of private motor vehicle should be reduced by the awareness of people for their duties about nation and taking strict action by the government. If the people understand their duties they will start using facilities run be the government like AC buses . Ċ In conclusion, I can state that if the facilities are provided by the government the people should have to use that are less expensive rather than using private vehicle."
10217,"Topic: International entertainers, including sports personalities, often get paid millions of dollars in one year. Are these huge earnings justified?","Nowadays, we are impressed by huge salaries a celebrity can earn in entertaining industries which is as much as millions of dollars in one year. Many people argured that it is unreasonble for them to live a luxury lives with these huge earnings while others live without basic necessities. In my opinion, I think that professionals with real talent deserve to be paid such a mount of money. Ċ Firstly, there are few people who are gifted with special talent in the world. It is obvious that in order to become a profession in the fields such as music, art or sports, they have to work very hard for a long period of time at young age. Some of them might sacrify many things to be successful. For example, instead of going to school, having a lot of friends and live a normal life, a great athlete has to live far from home at a very young age and follow strictly training program before he can attend Olympic Games and win medals Ċ Although it is justifiable for these celebrities to earn huge earnings, I suggest that they should share their fortune with the poor and disabled. For instance, they can devote their money to charitable fund to help the ones in need. Moreover, they can spare their precious time to tell the young about their story, which I think would inspire and help a lot of people. Ċ In conclusion, it is impossible for us to change the way the world is ruled but we can make effort to help others to have a better life."
10218,"Some people think public libraries are necessary, others believe that the public libraries are useless. What is your opinion and provide with some relevant examples.","Over time there were numerous methods instigated to share knowledge and most theories and studies were written down on a piece of paper. However, with the advancement in technology,many libraries are losing their value. While some individuals believe that libraries are redundant, others think that they are beneficial. In my opinion, libraries have numerous benefits and people should utilize and visit such places frequently. In this essay, we shall discuss these two topics further. Ċ Firstly, the primary reason for libraries to be lucrative is due to their plethora of resources. An individual can find ancient scripts and dialects to modern-day publications all in one place. Secondly, it offers a hands-on experience for many people, especially, bookworms and avid readers. Lastly, it serves as an ideal place to read; for example, in this hectic urban environment many students, teachers and commoners prefer libraries to be the most tranquil place to study and concentrate. Overall, libraries are essential to individuals in various aspects. Ċ On the other hand, there are some individuals who believe that libraries are insignificant. Furthermore, since the advent of the internet all the resources can be found online; for instance, online books, publications, and scripts. Moreover, the time and energy used in travelling or maintaining a library are reduced. Conversely, not all the information available online could be reliable, and thus reading a book itself would be plausible. Ċ To summarize, there are two sides to a coin. Therefore, although electronic-libraries drastically changed the circumstances these days, I believe that libraries still have a positive impact on our society."
10219,Foreign visitors should pay more than local visitors for cultural and historic attractions. To what extent do you  agree or disagree ? taking money from tourists for local purposes,"It is said that foreigners should pay out more money than internal guests when they come to visit cultural and historic attractions. I completely disagree with dis point of view. Ċ Firstly, it would be difficult to calculate the exact amount of money and the staff would be required to do this complex process. For example. cultural and historic sites attract not only domestic but also external visitor from around the world, and not all travelling destinations have an appropriate system that separate these types of guests. Hence, it seems to be an uphill struggle for cashiers to accomplish this task. Secondly, if the government demands higher payment from international visitors, they would consider the new rule as an impediment of choosing the nation as a place to spend on their vacation, resulting in some decreases in the number of guests and financial incomes supporting the tourism industry. Ċ In my opinion, all guests are equally important and should be treated unbiasedly. As historic and cultural places are becoming a country's national identity, it is crucial to present the nation's prides to the world through foreigners. And a way to do that is maintaining, or reducing, ticket prices and accommodation fees for external tourists. For instance, oversea guests have to pay a certain amount of money for transportation, food, etc., and they would not feel happy or comfortable to pay for another increasing bill. Ċ In conclusion, I oppose the idea that foreigners have to be required more than local visitors for tourism because they should be equally treated."
10220,Many people from rural areas moving to the cities. What problem can this cause? What can be solutions?,"It is clearly evident that, moving from rural areas to the big metropolitan city has become a tradition in most of the families. However, it can can pose a problem in the society. Numerous solutions can be taken up by individuals to curb this point of view. Ċ Firstly, moving into the vast city life can pose a problem in the society itself. It would be the cause of a drastic decrease in the population of the countryside. Additionally, increase in population density in the urban areas can pave the way for a drop in basic amenities, namely food, shelter and water. This would greatly affect the mental as well as physical well being of a person, yet most of them prefer this way for a better living and comfort. As a result, the number of farmers and other primary producers may also go down, giving rise to food shortage problems, because each and every pupil are aiming to be an engineer or a doctor. More hospitality, good quality education and nearby services force people to migrate to the suburban areas. For instance, a survey depicted that, there was a 50% increase in the relocation of mankind to the towns. Ċ Finally, solutions to this issue cannot bring a sudden change, rather it would take plenty of time. One great solution can be contributed by the government, by boosting up the number of medical facilities and other needful provisions for humans. By doing this, they would tend to stay in their homeland. Another solution could be, bringing up more job opportunities in the rural side, which would in turn shoot up the economical status of certain families who suffer to acquire 3 meals a day. For example, awareness campaigns and promotions have been going on in most of the rural areas to build up better generations, without the facilities offered by the city life. Ċ In conclusion, moving into cities wouldn't pose a problem unless you fully indulge in the city life and heavenly materialistic objects that it may provide. Both society and government can tackle this upcoming threat by changing the lifestyle and occupation criteria."
10221,Some people think government should subsidies food and vegetables to make healthy food cheaper. Other argues that tax should be set on unhealthy food. Discuss both views and gives your opinion.,"Nutritional value of foods is an important thing to be considered before purchasing food items. Therefore, some individuals have an opinion that the government should lower the prices of healthy foodstuffs to promote a thriving lifestyle, while there are others who think that taxes should be imposed on junk meal to reduce their consumption. In this essay, I will discuss both views and give my opinion in the end. Ċ Healthy diets play a vital role in maintaining fitness as well as boosting our immunity. Most of the people, especially the working class, prefers to have fast foods as they are tastier and cooks in lesser time. In spite of knowing the negative consequences of these foods, they take them regularly as they do not have any other choice but to have them due to their tight schedules. Moreover, natural meals such as fruits and vegetables are expensive as compared to ready-made eateries due to which destitute people cannot afford them. Consequently, alleviating the costs of healthy foods will make these eatables affordable for all sections of society. Ċ On the other hand,the government can impose taxes on fast food so that lesser people would buy them. First of all, young children like to eat burger and pizzas more than adult. Thus, when prices will come higher and their parents would not give extra money to them, it will definitely check their unhealthy eating habits. Another thing is that if the costs of these meals become elevated, then the individuals would have no choice and they have to shift towards nutritious eatables. As a result, the market of junk food will get effected which will eventually impact their production too. Ċ To conclude, I would say that instead of imposing taxes on unhealthy diets, authorities should subsidize the costs of healthy eating stuff so that people can easily buy them and get benefits out of it. In my opinion, elevating the prices of foodstuffs will do nothing more than but just affecting the budget of the common public as a richer class will never need to care about expenses."
10222,"Nowadays newspapers publish information about the private lives of individuals. Some people think the government should maintain certain control over the information that gets published, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","In the contemporary era, the individual's privacy is being opened up because the newspapers have published every minor detail.Thus, it is often argued that the authority should outlaw the publication of futile information, whereas there still remain some disagreement in this view. From my perspective, the journal should focus on the indispensable news instead of disturbing another person's personal space.This essay will highlight both opinions and also elaborate the need of controlling the irrelevant news. Ċ On the one hand, these days, the news reporters are only concerned about the profit margins because of that they publish the information regarding the private growth of the public rather than the authentic news. Hence, the legislator ought to control the redundant information by enacting strict rules and regulations. Similarly, the journalist will be emboldened to publish the current issue. To illustrate, if the newspaper upload the news regarding the rape, murder, terrorist attacks, the general public will be aware. As a result, the crime rate would be eliminated from the globe. Ċ On the other hand, though the magazines play a significant role in individuals everyday life, it is often published the activities of individuals' private life, especially, the activity of the eminent personalities.This is because the teenagers consider them as a role model. For instance, the lifestyles and the diligence of the actors have been uploaded in a plethora of the online media, which will inspire millions of the population. Consequently, this will bring positive changes in the individuals' lives. Ċ In conclusion, even though the publication of the news in the private life of the well -known persons will inspire the youth to perform a better in the future, it can lead to various problems. Therefore, it is significant to control such news in order to create the public awareness."
10223,Some people encourage young children to leave their parents house as soon as they become adults while other say children should stay at their parents house as long as possible. Discuss both the views and give your opinion.,"a few individuals motivate youngsters to be more independent by moving out from their family once they become mature, whereas others, on the opposite, say that they should postpone it. This essay discusses both sides of this argument and why I believe that youngsters should take this move. Ċ There are two reasons why people think that minors should not live alone the moment they look mature. To begin with, the first reason why families should not allow their offspring to leave their house is that they are not fully aware of themselves. Thus, young adults might commit a fatal flaw that might change their trajectory in life. For example, when a teen is caught up with an unlegal drug this might put that teen in prison. Therefore, in the future, most businesses will not hire him this is because of his criminal record. Moreover, another reason why parents must not approve of the idea of pursuing independence at a young age is that it is too risky. Not to mention, is that maybe this kid is abused by someone else. Ċ On the other hand, I personally agree with those who claim that it is kosher for someone who has just matured to be independent by leaving their parent villa. The main reason why this consensus agrees with this argument is that it will make a youngster more accountable. Furthermore, it will have taught them how to survive, so they have to be more alert about themselves, their surroundings, and life. How to cook, for instance, when a young adult lives alone this might teach that kid how to prepare a good meal. Secondly, being independent at a young age would enrich a minor's experience. Despite the fact that they might be exposed to a variety of people which means that they have to know how to deal with them. Ċ In conclusion, I believe both sides have merits. On balance, however, it is my opinion that a future adult has to seize this chance to live alone this is because eventually it will make them more accountable and teach them how to tackle life."
10224,"It is seem that while studying, university student stay away from their parents in most country. Some people think it is good for the student. Do you agree or disagree.","At present time, higher qualification is more essential for all students who want to achieved highest pick of success. so, students sacrificed to leaved the parents as well as social life. But, end of the study its beneficial for students. Ċ The university offered various types of courses for scholar student in which selection process is too complicated like medical line , engineering line. therefore, students who joined their favourite courses with suffered from friends and parents. In this period they have mentally strong although , they managed time to study and money which spent by parents and also pupils have fill fearless moreover, they make good friends in hostel life. Therefore, toddlers have well matured and handle all the situation in any kind of problem in hall life. Ċ However, students diverted some bad habits and also joined dirty pertinent which can be possible to spoil their carrier like having smoking, tobacco chewing, drugs etc., it is seen that some junior scholar faced scholar so, its highly stressful for all junior and some hostel cannot be provided hygienic food and clean room. So, it is bad for health. Lastly, parents suffered from all thinks like money and carrier of their naughty child. Ċ In the conclusion, students studied from hostel or pain guest is highly negative effect to their study and life style thus, I personally believed that candidate should be joined boarding school or university to unexpected circumstances which faced parents and students."
10225,"In the past young people depended on their parents for making decisions. Today, young people are better able to make decisions on their own. Which do you prefer?","In my opinion, I prefer to young people make decision by themselves. Some people disagree with my opinion, because their parents give them good advices. Then, they can decide their decisions easily. However, to make decisions by our selves is important to our life. I will explain my choice some specific examples as follows. Ċ First, it is because my parents do not have good opinions. Actually, I want to be a professional dancer. However, my parents are not dancers. They have no dance knowledge. Although they encourage my dance practice, they can not teach me. If I depend on their opinion, my dance skill will not grow up, as they are not professional. I always trust my decisions, because it is good ways to improve my dance ability efficiently. Even if I have some mistake while I am practicing dance, I can learn many things through to have mistake. Finally, to make decisions on my own is a good way to grow up my personality and characters more. Ċ Second, it is because I can not have fun if I depend on my parents. For example, I could not have a good time, when I went to Disneyland with my parents. I really like the rides, but my parents do not. I have never gone to Disneyland before, then my parents made a plan for me. Unfortunately, they planned to watch some shows and go some rides which for young children. I wanted to enjoy other activities, but they did not have the same stamina and tastes. So that, I did not have fun. On the other hand, when I went there again with my friends, I prepared everything and had great memories. Accordingly, it is better to make decisions by myself rather than by tour parents, because we have age difference. Ċ Therefore, those are why I think that young people are better able to make decisions on their own."
10226,Advertising campaigns on TV that are targeted at children should be banned. Ċ To what extent to you agree or disagree with this opinion? Ċ Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"We live in a world which is full of advertisement and these promotions are consciously and subconsciously shaping our purchasing power. Nowadays, many ads are targeting only children on TV, billboards or the internet. I strongly agree with this statement. This should be prohibited as their strategies to target child is totally unethical and have detrimental effects on our young generation. Ċ To begin with, there are many reasons for these kinds of promotion should be forbidden. In the first place, kids are not decision-makers and not mature enough to differentiate quality products from low-grade ones. For instance, many chocolate companies make advertisements to allure children their promotion have more fantasy than facts. Though they know that parents would be the potential buyer, they try to use the sentiments of kids and their desires to parents to buy their goods. This is the unethical and detrimental effects for all babies ergo, these kinds of ads should be blocked on mass media. Ċ Moreover, these days kids watch TV more than ever before. This is one of the reasons for ads targeted to the toddler. Some kinds of blurb are trying to brainwash the toddler in order to buy their goods. Childhood periods is the most precious time for proper psychological growth and that is why promotion that fixes on babies repercussion, the babies get detrimental to their cognitive development. Ċ To conclude, undoubtedly all campaigns and blurb that fix on children have only one thing prevalent-mislead the young, allure them and force their fathers and mothers to purchase products. In my opinion ,about this, this part of unethical and misleading advertisement should be banned on TV as a result, the next generation people will not be suffered."
10227,"Some people think technology makes life complex, so we should make life simpler without using technology. Do you agree or disagree?","There is no denying of the fact that for some people technology made life harder specially old people, although this is not he case for others. In my opinion, I disagree with the statement and I believe modern ways made growth more comfortable. In this essay, I will examine how machinery has affected the lives and will provide necessary illustration. Ċ To begin with, Modern Instruments made life much liveable and enjoyable, there are a plethora of examples for the same. In other words, with the help of gadgets complex jobs can easily be performed. For example, Amul recently produced 100 thousand of dairy products which included manufacturing and packaging, it was done with the help of machines and in just 2 weeks. As a result, production these days are much easier and numerous types of products are available in the market. Ċ On the other hand, older generation find it hard to cope up with the technological advancements, what I mean is, as they new to this technology and they are familiar with orthodox ways, it is harder for them to use modern tech. For instance, my grandfather finds it really hard to use mobile phone and he often gets lost in the apps. Consequently, aged people criticize the machinery and believe it just makes life complex. Ċ To conclude, technology is definitely shaping how the world works. Younger people admire the automation and opines that it made life happier, while elders thinks it just problems are just replace and are not solved. However, I think if elder people take initiative and try to learn the aspects they will also agree that technology is a boon to humankind."
10228,some say that music plays an important role in society while others think it is simply a form of entertainment. discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Opinions are divided on whether music is just a method for entertaining, or whether it has an essential impact on society. While I understand why some people support the former view, I am still in favour of the latter. Ċ Those who believe that music is simply a form of entertainment may have several arguments. From their point of view, there are many ways to entertain better than music, so music does not have major influences on them. People will underestimate the importance of music if they feel interested in sport. Another point is that some of us may not gain advantages such as relaxation, joy from music. This is the factor behind the reason why people ignore the positive role of music and assess it is just a form of entertainment. Ċ Nevertheless, I still think that those who believe that music is essential in society for several reasons. Chief among these is that music has profound impacts on our mental health. It helps us relax and reduce the risk of stress. Furthermore, choosing appropriate types of music to listen to at different time in a day can improve memory and concentration. Looking at the second idea, music plays an important role in life because it offers chances for us to have a job related to this field. For instance, due to music, not only do musicians compose a lot of popular songs but also theaters can maintain their operation. This allows us to make a living and boost our life quality. Ċ In conclusion, despite acknowledging why people think that music is normally a form of entertainment, I still hold the belief that it has enormous influences on our society."
10229,"Because of the busy pace of modern life, many children spend most of their time indoors and have little exposure to the natural world. How important is it for children to learn to understand and appreciate nature?","Nowadays, modern technology changes people's lifestyle. Because of this, some people now prefer spending their time to relax and enjoy their lives. However, others argue that children should play in the nature world to take more experience. Therefore, I believe that it is really important for children to explore wider environment to improve children's social skill. Ċ With regard to spend time indoors, children have limited environment to explore their talent. For example children just know playing computer games instead of playing an outside activity with other friends. Consequently, children grow up with different behavior or custom from places where children live. Ċ On the other hand, taking to the nature world can change children's way of life. This is because children can imitate lifestyle of adult around them after the children make close relationship and observe adult's behavior. In addition, children also are used to challenge which they face so that, this condition encourages children to be more independent. Ċ The aforementioned evidence reveals that although advanced technology makes quitter to stay at home and can get some benefits from the technology, children must have social skill which can make children to survive with life challenge in the future. Therefore, I would argue that parents should encourage their children to play in the nature world to improve children's ability."
10230,Men and women can never share the same responsibilities at home and in everyday life. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.,"The discrimination between males and females has existed from ancestor time, and both were supposed to engage in a particular type of activities. Even in today’s contemporary society, some conservatives assert that they should confine themselves to designated roles and responsibilities as per the old-time and I completely disagree with it. Ċ There are several reasons why I believe both can share the same work. First and foremost , this equality is provisioned by law. To elaborate, each nation’s constituent states, men and women have the freedom to work and they are legally entitled to engage in tasks of their choice. Even to eradicate partiality and encourage women participation in some fields like politics, countries have reservations for them. For instance, India has reserved a 30 per cent quota in civic elections to empower them. Secondly, men are also actively involved in house chores. This is because they understand the value of their contribution as it plays an imperative role in the growth and well being of the family. Ċ Moreover, these modern societies follow a liberal ideology. To put more light on it , nowadays the community supports girls and boys equally to follow their passion. As a result, there is a surge in the number of girls in services like the military, governments and considerable participation of gents in areas like culinary. For example , Ranvir brar, a famous chef able to achieve his dream by crossing several social barriers. Ċ To sum up, in the modern world men and women are not limited to specific jobs, they are skilful to perform any assigned job equitably."
10231,The nuclear family is well adapted to moving due to its size. Do you think children benefit in any way from moving? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvanta,"Nowadays, most families are nuclear, hence, it is easier for them to go from one place to another. Children in these kinds of brood might gain some benefits. However, in my opinion, in such a situation the cons outweigh the pros. Ċ To begin with, when a clan migrates, the offsprings are at an advantage of getting more maturity and gaining more experience of diverse cultures as compared to the child who doesn't get the opportunity of frequently travelling. For instance, juveniles from military kin travel a lot because of their father's profession and gain more knowledge of different civilizations as well as places, which aid them to become self-sufficient. In addition, adolescents in the alike scenarios could get also get a break to learn various languages. Ċ On the other hand, akin migrations for the youngsters, there are disadvantages that exceed the aforesaid advantages. Firstly, if a minor is moving from one place to another repeatedly, most of the time they feel insured. For example, a child who is introverted in nature suddenly finds himself in a new place, suffers from an identity crisis as the people are unknown around him. Moreover, a kid may become self-centred as his emotional and social needs may barely fulfil by his parents at this phase. Ċ To conclude, bearing in mind the above information and deliberating all facts, it can be deduced that although relocation of a household is easier because of its small size and might be lucrative for the offspring, the cons can not be ignored as it affects the betterment of the youth in the future."
10232,TOPIC : Organized tour to remote areas and community is increasingly popular . It is a positive or negative development the local people and the environment ? the popularity of trips to distant destinations,"In the present days , package-tours is created visiting to many distant destinations or mountainous areas , which increasingly was catching on . In spite of this development is beneficial economy in the local residents but still have many potential impacts on others side instead . Ċ First of all , I strongly support that the benefits is hugely bring to resident by creating employments and job markets to increase the stable income for majority of local residents . Beside , the visitors from the organized tour especially from foreign countries who help to open opportunities to learn many foreign languages or cultures supporting to open the knowledges or more easily earn money leading to little by little boost the living standard for those area . Ċ But in the other hand , having many building or infrastructure for travelling purposes can be lead to some of the detriments , which is damaged to local species and loss of habitat . Also , just minority of hordes of tourist have some of bad awareness of protecting the nature can extremely exert influence on the environment . And with the bad behaviours from them can lead to some serious traffickings or even to accidents . Ċ In sum , although the advantages from organized tour to remote destinations could bring about , it is more likely to bring up many bad impacts on the local people and the environment ."
10233,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: The best way to improve the quality of education is to increase teachers' salary.,"As education is the core of modern society, people are deeply concern about the quality of education. While I accept that money-incentives can improve teacher's efficiency, I believe that there are many ways better than simply raising tutors' salaries. Ċ On the one hand, increasing wages can attract better teachers and arouse more teachers' enthusiasm. From a pragmatic perspective, financial incentives can attract talented teachers. For example, in remote villages, salaries for teachers are low, which deters good candidates. That is why a talented graduate with a degree in education tend to find a job in big cities where usually promise a high salary. In addition, increasing wages for teachers enable them to focus on preparing lessons and academic researches. The teacher with a well-paid will never have to engage in other part-time job because of the low wage that cannot afford the housing mortgage. Thereby, the quality of teaching can be improved immediately. Ċ However, I would argue that raising the wages is not the best choice. As the schools are always on the tight budget, it is more urgent for them to invest money in training teachers and to introduce modernized teaching equipment. To begin with, training teachers can enable students to receive better education more quickly and economically, compared to offer a huge pay to non-experienced graduates. The teaching quality can be enhanced greatly, if every teacher has got enough tainting. Moreover, investing in facilities, such as purchasing the chemical equipment and building the physics laboratory, would be better measures to improve quality of education, which is what a school really requires. Ċ In conclusion, although providing teachers' with the huge wage is a good method to enhance the quality of education, training tutors and improving the school facilities would be better measures."
10234,Some people think that having people from different nationalities and cultural background living together in the same country makes the country develop faster. Do you agree,"Variety of nationalities, obeying different culture and tradition believer, living together is one of the reasons for the growth of the economy of a country. However, while I believe that people of opposite nationalities may feel, uneasiness in sharing thoughts, I agree mixture of variety of fashion and experience of life will boost the country's economy. Ċ Provincial to develop on a global platform, needs people all over the world to work for them, with them and for them. Firstly, when an international group of people meet together, they try to understand each other's thoughts, beliefs and chemistry. Because they tend to learn new languages, rules and habits. For instance, let us assume, there is an international workers' group, one is from Japan, one is from India and another is from Germany, each individual homey is known for their positive attitude. Japanese are very punctual, Indians are very hard working and the Germans are born intelligent. Therefore, combination like this develops a high working quality and thus its good to have different nationalities in a bucolic. Ċ A provincial allows immigrate's workers and resident to enter their agrarian, to understand different culture, beliefs and traditions. Firstly, people from each province has a unique quality towards his/her motherland, whether it is god they follow or the food they eat. In addition, countries believe, people from different rustic will start investing capital and boost economy. For example, people love to know new cultures and norms, in Canada there are 34 different nationalities which includes, international students and foreign workers reside, they are happily sharing their thoughts and tradition with each other, hence Canada is the fastest growing rustic with GDP 8 plus. Furthermore, individual are accepting and allowing themselves to explore and know more about other living. Ċ In conclusion, I would say, development of a rustic totally depends on the residence of the rustic. I agree, an individual from a different rustic and following different culture, staying in foreign rustic is best way to for a country to expand globally."
10235,Many office authorities impose restriction on smoking within the offices premises. Some governments have even banned smoking in all public places. This is a good idea but it takes away some of our freedom. Ċ What are your opinions on this?,"Smoking cigarettes is becoming more trending in today's world. It is a kind of new fashion. In spite of this, smoking has several disadvantages too and for that, workstations and public places are disallowing smoking in their buildings. This essay augments my opinions. Ċ Smoking publically can cause diseases to the people and to the consumer as well. That is why several offices forbid smoking in their buildings. Moreover, smoking can cause serious illnesses such as asthma and other heart problems. For example, in public places, active smokers are consuming cigarettes but,stillAdd a comma,stillIt appears that you are missing a comma after the introductory phrase still. Consider adding a comma. Ċ show examples passive smokers can be affected by that atmosphere as passive smokers are also consuming that nicotine by air. The survey shows that smokers are 96% more likely to have heart disease than non-smokers and furthermore, the average life of active users are 56 years while the average span of life for passive consumers are 2 times higher than the active consumers. Ċ On the other hand, cigarette users are polluting air and land by exhaling in the atmosphere and throwing their cigs on the ground and that creates tons of garbage on the planet Earth. Researchers said that the Earth's air pollution is increased by 87% by 2021 than 1990. and said that it will impact in a horrendous way. It may cause global warming, flood, or draughts on some of the parts of the globe. As a result, the famous African forest caught fire and the investigation team found out that It was because of global warming and that many reptiles, birds and other creatures lost their lives. Thus, it is dangerous for other creatures as well. Ċ To conclude, in my opinion, prohibiting smoking in public or private places can prevent health problems and can some extend reduce atmosphere and land pollution. Although, government and workplaces should make separate smoking rooms for users to smoke and relaxation."
10236,Some people say politicians promote the development of society. However others believe that it is scientists who have more influence on the world. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"If the society can be compared as a piece of artwork, then the politicians are the craftsmen who measure the size of the art and frame it into the best condition to display its delicacy, while the scientists are the artists who draw on the blank and decorate with colors. Technically, it is hard to conclude that whose influence overtakes the other when both of them are so indispensable to the society. Ċ Politicians, who are elected by citizens to represent their wills to manage their countries, devote their energies to enforce the regulations to maintain the social harmony and make decisions that can affect the national ups and downs in the future. Primarily, their interactions with other national leaders in the international affairs can determine the relationship between countries and the global cooperation. Meanwhile, their political proposals of tax and health insurance can influence the national economic development. Moreover, their personal charming in the pubic speeches can inspire millions of people to work the best of them and return to the society. Ċ Although the scientists, whose space is narrowed to laboratories and academic journals by normal people superficially, might not be renowned as public celebrities as politicians, their jobs mark every milestone in human history. Without their endeavor in exploration and experiments, we are still the chimpanzees who use the wood to light a fire and walk with four limbs on the ground. The inventions like computers, televisions and airplanes drive us into better living standards with the technological fuels to accelerate the speed, which can never be achieved by the politicians. Ċ In conclusion, both politicians and scientists are crucial in the development of society; the world can only thrives in both the guidance of politicians and the contributions of scientists."
10237,"Over the last few decades, the media has promoted the image of young thin women as being ideal. What problem has this caused? What solutions can you suggest to this issue?","From the centuries, women have been confined to some social norms. One of which is being thin. This norm has been promoted by the media and show-biz for the past few decades without considering the harmful impact, it can cause. There are some steps that need to be taken to prevent it. Ċ To commence with, it causes some of the dangerous problems for the young minds. Firstly, it negatively impacts the mental and physical health of young girls. This trend makes them feel that they can only be accepted and loved, if they are thin. For instance, in the field of modelling, only thin girls with proper physique can participate. So, to achieve the thin body, they start starving themselves, which causes several problems such as low blood pressure, weakness etc. Secondly, this trend encourages the objectification of women in the society. Women are not allowed to be comfortable in their own skin, and making them second class citizens of the world. Therefore, it only showcases the gender bias towards women. Ċ However, there are some solutions to it. The idea that can prove to be the most effective one, is to educate kids from their childhood, about the equality between thin and obese people in terms of opportunities. Furthermore, kids, whether girls or boys, should be taught that beauty lies within a person and is not superficial to be measured by skin or body type. They should be taught that becoming a good human is more important. For example, if a kid, who is taught from childhood not to discriminate on the basis of body type, upon growing up, will teach other people as well, thus improving the society. Ċ To conclude, the concept of thin ideal promotes the degradation of mental and physical health of girls. In my opinion, the best way to improve the situation is to take steps such as guiding and educating kids with the moral values of equality."
10238,"Throughout history, people have dreamed of living in a perfect society but nobody has agreed on what an ideal society would look like. What do you think is the most important element needed to make a society perfect? How can the ideal society be achieved?","From ancient times, people have imagined inhabiting in a perfect society, but the perfect definition of society has not been fixed yet. I think the most important element required in creating a society is values given to the individuals by their ancestors. These elements can be achieved with the sacraments inhibited to the people since their birth. Ċ Firstly, if we talk about the evolution of human beings, the man started living in groups since early times and that evolved into the people we are today. For instance, people used to live in the tribes in the era of the medieval period and they taught values to their children which passed on to next generations. Secondly, the competency came with the experience which resulted in today’s civilization. Finally, The sacraments given by the ancestors is one of the most important elements which shows the outlook of any community. Ċ Moreover, an ideal society is where there is peace everywhere. One of the major concern of this global economy is wars. Many nations fight to merge or accumulate the maximum area into their country. They want to show power to other societies to keep themselves on the top worldwide. For example, the USA and China, sometimes gets on the verge of war with each other, just to show their competency level up from each other. Although United Nations interfere and try to maintain harmony among the nations, it is also the sole responsibility of every nation to not perform any activities that may harm humanity. Ċ In conclusion, I would say values and sacraments can improve the way we look at an ideal society. There should be peace among the nations so that every individual feel safe on this earth."
10239,"The world is consuming natural resources faster than they can be renewed. Therefore, it is important that products are made to last. Governments should discourage people from constantly buying more up to date or fashionable products. To what extent do you agree with this statement?","The earth is blessed with various resources, some are renewable while others are not. Moreover, the advancement across various sectors are providing us with innovative things that are attracting humans. Nevertheless, some people believe that the authorities should not promote purchasing of upgraded commodities. I am against this opinion as doing so will have an impact on the economy of the country. Ċ On the one hand, there are a variety of products that are made by cutting down forests. For example, the trees are the lifeline of civilization. In order to produce paper, we cut them down incessantly. This is definitely not an appropriate trend as losing them will have a detrimental effect on our society. Thus, we should figure out ways to recycle them, and deforestation should be stopped. Therefore, the governing bodies should implement stricter laws in such cases. Ċ Conversely, it is always not a brilliant idea to discourage the purchase of products. For instance, the automobile sector requires a significant quantity of iron for manufacturing. Also, this segment has an enormous contribution to the GDP of the land. Hence, reusing cars will have an adverse implication on it .Besides that ,it will also pollute the environment. Henceforth, this trend should not be promoted for the betterment of living. Ċ To conclude, mother earth has a plethora of resources that can be utilized for a multitude of purposes. However, we will have to be sensitive and use them rationally . In my opinion, prohibiting or demotivating consumers from buying state-of-the art products are not sustainable."
10240,Nowadays many students live with their families while others go to another city to study at a university. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of both scenarios.,"In this contemporary world, tertiary education has become immensely popular. To pursue higher studies, several students start living in a new city, whereas some students still stay with their families. Both options of living have some benefits and shortcomings, which will be discussed in this essay. Ċ Living with a family has some clear advantages that make it the prime choice for students around the world. Pupils can properly concentrate on their studies as they need not participate in different household activities such as grocery, cleaning and paying utility bills. Being free from such household chores allows the students to allocate more time in studies which is likely to result in higher academic grades. However, the distance between the family residence and the university may become the major problem for staying with family. Statistics suggest that 80% of university students in the USA enrolled form distant cities or countries. If those students chose to continue their education from home, it would be impossible for them to find a standard educational institution at hometown. Ċ On the other hand, shifting to a new place for education tends to have some benefits. Students can learn many life skills when living alone, which help them prosper in their professional life. With such self-dependent citizens, a country is likely to achieve its optimum growth backed by its human capital. Nevertheless, difficulty to maintain the remaining living costs appeared to be as a threat to living alone in a new city for education. As a result, many students need to engage in a part-time job to keep up their residential expenses at the cost of their study time. Poor academic grades, dropouts are some of the instances arise from shifting in another city. Ċ In summary, both of the living methods of university students have some pros and cons."
10241,"A lot of people spend a major part of their adult life at work, so job satisfaction is very important for individual happiness. What are the main factors that contribute to job satisfaction? What are the possible solutions for people who are unsatisfied with their jobs?","The majority of the population dedicate their adulthood towards earning a living for themselves and their loved ones, and it is crucial to be content with their work. The essay will discuss the main features of job contentment and provide practical solutions to deal with dissatisfaction at the workplace. Ċ To commence with, there are two major aspects of job satisfaction: recognition, and a platform to voice out concerns. Many employers tend to motivate their employees by rewards and recognition in the form of monetary benefits, such as incentives, and bonuses for meeting the target-specific objectives. These practices are intended to keep their workforce happy and improve results. In addition to this, there are various firms that provide platforms to voice our concerns with respect to work like unjust appraisal or conflicts among them or lack of facilities that are ought to be provided by the firm. An employee, for instance, might come across an unjust behaviour in the team, he/she could reach out to the Human Resource team directly and raise the issue in order for the management to investigate and resolve it accordingly. As a result, the employees in these organisations are associated with them for a long period of time. Ċ Despite these practices in the organisations, there are many individuals who are dissatisfied with their role in the company. It can be solved by conducting an anonymous survey in order to identify the top causes contributing to dissatisfaction. The data obtained can be analysed and help the company to come up with new rules and policies to address these causes. Furthermore, companies , for example, might make attempts to keep their workforce satisfied by rewarding them with incentives for taking extra initiatives in the team, resulting in motivation and contentment across the firm. Ċ In conclusion, after a thorough analysis, it is evident that an individual is often felt content in the workplace if the employer appreciates their contribution and provides freedom to discuss any issue, however, they should keep looking for areas of improvement to increase the satisfaction of their group."
10242,Many people today think that homework is still an important part of school while others think that it is becoming outdated. Ċ Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Over the years, schools have regularly revised their curriculums to impart structured knowledge to their students, however,a few people contend the process of giving home assignments to pupils. I believe that this practice of imposing assignments might appear to be unfair, it is actually immensely beneficial for school-aged children. Ċ Regular home assignments might be sometimes overwhelming for children. This is because children already spend a considerable amount of time focussing on innumerable subjects ranging from mathematics, social studies to science in school, which makes them tired and exhausted. Furthermore, completing worksheets on home would definitely be an additional burden on them causing them anxiety and depression in them. As a result, they would struggle to sleep on time which hampers their efficiencies and productivity for the next day. Not only they feel depressed, but also unhealthy as they do not get a chance to get immersed in any kind of physical activity such as playing badminton, yoga and light exercises to revive them. Ċ However, homework as a whole has proven to be crucial for a successful academic career. Most importantly, doing homework on a daily basis leads to a continuous learning process and sharpen their memory. One standout example is the study conducted by the University of California which reveals that students who have been given homework daily tend to secure A or A+ grades in the formal examinations as compared to those who are devoid of any assignments. In addition, this tendency enables students to become more punctual and organized as they learn to manage various assignments simultaneously. Moreover, this certainly develops the habit to prioritise things and perform them effectually, which is a lifelong skill. Ċ In conclusion, it is evident that although regular home assignments given by the teachers might appear inappropriate on a few grounds, it is actually highly significant that students are taking these seriously and completing them on time. If students have the vision to be successful academically, they should do their homework efficaciously."
10243,Some people feel unsafe when they are at home and in public. What are some possible causes of this and what are some possible solutions? increased fear from crime and disaster,"Currently,personal safety has become a popular issue in our society. In this essay, the reasons will be described and suggestions will be provided. Ċ To beginning with,the feeling of danger could caused by high crime rate. When criminal activities are common in a society, no one will feel safe and be protected.For example, if you were living in a place that murder, rapes, robbery are always happened.Would you still sit in office and back home until late? Definitely not.Moreover, natural disaster is another concernable reason.Natural disaster brings a serious lost for human life and their properties. Such as earthquake can destroy building, highway etc. Ċ Nevertheless,there are some advice that can make people fell safety. One of the recommendations is; develop a trained police force.By reducing crime rate, trained police force and a fair legal system is necessary.It rapidly increase the cost of taking part in criminal activities.Likewise,good city planning and special construction structure can minimise the lost from natural disasters.Some special materials can be added at the bottom of building; it absorbs energies when the ground moved.On the other hand,life saving is playing another important role after disaster happened. A well-trained and fully-equipped first-aid team can save people life after serious natural disaster happened. It makes commonly believe that their life are protected by trusted life saving guards.For instance, earthquake is always happen in Japan.However,most of Japanese still prefer to stay in their country because they have professional life-saving guards can protect them when earthquake happen. Ċ In summary, the fear from crime and disaster can be countered by professional police team and rescue team, but also a fair judgment and well-designed disaster-proofed buildings."
10244,"Modern society benefits greatly from computer technology. However, becoming more dependent on computers has its disadvantages. Discuss threats of computers.","Undoubtedly, one of the most significant innovations in recent years has been computer technology. However, a matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue whether the modern world benefits from artificial intelligence, or is rather addicted to using it. Ċ Apart from being time-saving, computers can also do things which people could hardly do before. For instance, people can find and share information in just a few seconds, or spend their free time reading electronic books, listening to music or even connecting with people from the other corners of the world. Furthermore, many scientists agree that computer technology plays a major role in modern medicine, in the future genetic engineers could be able to find new cures for diseases like cancer, AIDS or diabets. Consequently, life-expectancy is longer than it used to be 20 years ago. Ċ However, the greatest disadvantage of using computers in addiction. As a recent study carried out by the 'International Group of Digital Development' shows, more than 73 per cent of people around the world said that computers controlled their life, spending about 10 hours per day in front of it, and almost 30 per cent claimed that they would grow angry or impatient if they did not turn on their computers. Further explanations are given by Michael Roberts, who points out that, just like drugs, computers can have devastating effects, starting with health problems: obesity, unhealthy diet, sedentarism, eyes disease and ending with mental disorders: madness, breakdowns or suicide attempts. Ċ To conclude, it is clear that computer technology is responsible not only for the development of genetic engineering and medical discoveries, but also for human beings' behaviour and activities. People can choose to benefit from this new technology, or be domined and sidetracked by it."
10245,Some people think that teachers at school are more responsible for children's intellectual and social development than parents. To what extend do you agree or dis agree? What is your personal opinion?,"As more priority is given to education on the current status quo, some people arrive at a consensus that instructors at school are more crucial for strengthening kids' intelligence and social contact than their parents because the time dedicated to schooling is more than ever before. Ċ To large extent, I oppose the viewpoint and regard parents as the most momentous teachers despite not best. Ċ For starter, parents are their first teachers who play a paramount role in moulding kids' characters, particularly in childhood, as well as have the power to determine educational things (e.g. which school the child will attend, whether hire a tutor), while the educators only assign some tasks and impart some knowledge. Ċ Moreover, throughout children's educational ""careers"", a child has to study a wide spectrum of curriculum, resulting that a large number of teachers will teach him or her compared with parents who will influence him or her all the time. What is more, educators always have too many students to pay equal attention to every student as well as ignore someone's particular demands. As the main purpose to attend school is to grasp knowledge, the educator might just cram children knowledge passively and mechanically. In comparison, parents who do not know the realistic knowledge might inspire their children to study, which could make kids acquire the most vital skills- learning- to lead successful lives during the 21st century. Ċ On comparison, parents are superior to the teachers in terms of development of their children's intelligence and social interaction."
10246,"In many parts of the world, there is continuous coverage of sports on television. Some people believe this discourages the young from taking part in any sport themselves. Discuss this view and give your own opinion?","There is no doubt that live sports coverage on television is very popular nowadays in a number of countries. There are many people who think that this might be the reason why the youngsters do not participate in outdoor games themselves, however, I completely disagree. Ċ Firstly, one of the main reasons for which many young people are not taking part in sports these days is fatigue. Today's educational system tends to have a toll on their health by keeping them busy throughout the day. Because of this, they often get too tired for any physical activities, and choose the easy way to enjoy sports. For example, playing soccer requires a substantial amount of energy, which they are usually drained off after a hard working day. Hence, going out and playing football themselves doesn't remain an option anymore. If people had more time to spare, they would have certainly preferred to go outdoors and enjoy a good match, instead of sitting idle inside the house, watching television. Ċ In fact, live matches may actually encourage them to play the sport themselves. The fact that numerous teenagers make their favourite star their role model and often tries to imitate their behaviour, playing style and fashion sense, supports the argument that they also motivate those kids to play like them as well. For instance, Ronaldo has been the star footballer for quite a few years now and many children as well as teenagers and adults have followed him, have bought a jersey with his name on it, have fought to get his jersey number as their own while playing with friends or in a match. Therefore, it is well proven how such stars motivate so many of the young people to play themselves. In reality, not having someone to follow or to idolize might have negatively impacted the willingness to play themselves more adversely. Ċ In conclusion, even though a handful hi of people might believe that the kids today are getting discouraged to play themselves simply because they get to watch thw sports even on television as and when it happens, i do not support this argument and believe that it is, as a matter of fact, is more of an encouraging factor for people to engage in such sports event."
10247,Medical professionals such as doctors and nurses from poor countries often migrate to richer countries to work. Ċ What problems arise from this situation? What measure can be taken to deal with it?,"Over the years, a lot of people linked to the medical profession tend to leave their poverty-stricken native countries and move to wealthier places in order to get a better job. There are several reasons associated with this trend which causes a variety of problems in their countries. However, there are viable measures which can be implemented by the government to tackle this issue. Ċ Firstly, people taking such steps are insecure due to the social and political conditions of their country. This is to say that they are unsure if they will be able to find an appropriate job with the respectable salary to justice their hard work and profession. Moreover, the significant problem associated with such a step effects nationwide. The country faces the loss of good doctors, which eventually worsens the whole medical system. It has been reported by the department of health sciences in South Asia that 80% of their medical graduates tend to work for Middle Eastern countries due to the best career opportunities they offer. Consequently, this imposes a threat on their own medical departments. Ċ There are two effective solutions to the problem of migrating medical professionals. One way to tackle this situation is for the government to ensure stability within the job sector. In other words, people should get jobs on the basis of merit and there should be enough career opportunities provided to them. Another method to deal with this situation is to give them sufficient perks to stay back in their native home town. Keeping in mind the medical professionals and how challenging their job is, they should be offered good salaries equivalent to their worth, like the other countries do. Ċ To conclude, while there are problems associated with the trend of migrating, they can be solved by taking a long term approach. Our government has a crucial part to play in restoring the talent within their country by securing their future through good jobs and handsome salaries."
10248,"who's the most responsible for the decline in crime? Some people think that the government should be responsible for crime prevention, while others believe that it is the responsibility of the individual to protect themselves. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","In consideration of the fact of crime rate have been rising at alarming rate, Some argued that self-prevention of individual is the most efficient way to defend against crime. while I agreed that though there is a necessity for each individual to learn some self-dense techniques, the role of government is more significant in preventing crime. Ċ On the one hand, each individual is certainly responsible for crime prevention. It is true that everyone of us cannot guarantee that police can be presented all the time. Hence, mastering certain techniques such as kungfu, karate, boxing can definitely help an individual protect themselves from an unforeseen incidence of criminal activity. In Japan, attempts to mandatorily implement such a self-defense training in school have been caught out and they have achieved a visible outcome since students are independent and responsible enough for crime prevention. Ċ On the other hand, there is a limit to what an individual can do on their own, as crime are getting more intense and are posing a more considerable threat to society nowadays. Only government can make crime rate in check by enforcing a stringent rule regarding offenders and ensuring police department is proactive enough. I believe these definitely constitute visible deterrents to those needy minds and help reduce crime rate to a great extent. For example, while India are suffering from a constant increase of crime rate due to its lenient law and loose police department, other places such as middle east who with harsh penalty are having the lowest crime rate. Ċ In conclusion, I believe while each member of society is held accountable for crime prevention, government has a major responsibility in preventing crime."
10249,"""Do you think people will be successful in an egalitarian society or in a society where people are allowed to succeed with merits?""","There are few people who believe that communist or egalitarian societies make people more successful. On the other hand, some others argue that, societies which recognize people based on merits will create a better environment to become successful. Ċ In a capitalistic society, people are recognized by their merits. This kind of environment motivates people to perform better and encourages talent. It does not support lazy people forcing everyone to contribute to the society. On the other side, basic necessities like food, health and education differ based on merits creating a heterogeneous atmosphere. Rich people can afford better health and education to their children which would exponentially increase the gap between rich and poor. Ċ The societies which treat everyone equally irrespective of their financial, mental or physical status are called egalitarian. This kind of environment will provide equal opportunities to both rich and poor. The basic human rights like right to health and education are freely available to everyone. As there is no difference in benefits for various kinds of jobs, people will choose jobs based on their interests. This would indirectly impact productivity of the nation. People will lead a happy and peaceful life as financial needs are taken care by the government. Although there are various advantages, people might feel monotonous life and might create an environment without competitive spirit. Ċ There are pros and cons in both forms of societies, but I believe egalitarian societies protect basic rights of people and make them more successful and happy."
10250,In the past people made better use of their time than they do today. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Since a few decades ago, people's lifestyles have changed. Nowadays looking tired is a common characteristic among citizens. Some may believe that individuals are managing really bad their time, in comparison to people in the past. I completely disagree with the statement due to the complexity of our current society. Ċ On the one hand, a few decades ago, inhabitants had more leisure time because they used to live in smaller cities. Then, they had easy access to amenities such as banks, schools and, markets. For example, workers travelled just for a few minutes to get to their offices. That advantage no longer exists. Another reason is that there were fewer crimes in those years. So, children were able to walk safely from school without their parents' presence. During that time parents could be developing any other activity. Ċ On the other hand, these days, each person has to do several things at the same time in order to accomplish their responsibilities. Since most of the cities around the world have shown dramatic growth, society has changed as well. For instance, it is no longer possible for kids to walk from their academic activities. The reason is the crime increasing rate. As a result, parents have to use their lunchtime to drop their kids at home and eat while driving. Traffic congestion is another people's time consumer. Moreover, health information is now available and more people are aware of exercise importance. Developing a sports activity is a crucial task for the current population. Those are several more activities to be completed than there were at other times. Ċ To conclude, having more spare time was a major advantage in the past but now is not available due to the several activities that become crucial with the past of the years. Therefore, I believe that people are more productive than others were before."
10251,Some people believe it is a good idea for students to work part-time to ensure better opportunities in the future. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is often said that students should have a part-time job alongside their study for a better future. I completely agree with this view, and will give my reasons below. Ċ In my opinion, the salary students earn from their part-time jobs is beneficial for them in many ways. Attending university requires much money to pay for a number of expenses, not only tuition fees but also the cost of books and academic supplies or accommodation if students are living away from home, and a part-time job will therefore allow them to cover these needs. Perhaps more importantly, I would also argue that teenagers may learn to become financially independent from their parents through part-time jobs. By working and earning their own income, these young people will understand the value of money, and develop a sense of responsibility and self-reliance, which prepares them to live on their own as adults. Ċ At the same time, I also believe that working while in school certainly boosts students' future career prospects. Through part-time jobs, especially one related to their major, teenagers can acquire details of what they have been taught, gain real experience and learn practical skills, which may help them stand out when applying for a job. Even if the job experience is not directly connected to the field, young people might be qualified for a position that those without that experience could not get. For example, I would argue that understanding children and their wants from working at a daycare center makes a difference in landing a position in the marketing department of a toy company when compared to someone that has no experience at all. Ċ In conclusion, I believe that those with part-time jobs will thrive in society and thus, students should be encouraged to work during their studies."
10252,eco-awareness in energy industry undefined Solar energy is becoming more and more popular as a source of household energy in many countries around the world. Why is this? What are the advantages and disadvantages of solar system?,"When it comes to the power resources, fossil fuels, coal and nuclear power play the important role in today's world. However, they all have their own limitations, for instance, fossil fuels emits carbon to the atmosphere, accelerating global warming and as it is consumed, it gone forever. As for nuclear power, we are concerned about the safety issue and how to deal with the radioactive pollutions. As the result, many governments and experts start to find other alternative sources of energy. Ċ With its renewable, abundant, sustainable qualities, solar system starts to gain its influence on the world stage. It's definitely a better energy resource compared with traditional resources. Firstly, we don't have to worry about one day the energy resource will be run out, because the sunlight is unlimited. Secondly, there are no noise impact, because there are no moving parts in the devices, which has advantages over other green-techs such as wind turbines. Lastly, the most importance is there is no contaminations and toxic chemicals to pollute the environment. Ċ On the contrary, expensive devices, such as the solar panel on the roof and solar cell are a big amount of money for average families and governments should also plan an large budget on the constructions, like solar storage. Besides, we know that the sunlight is limited in certain time and it's alway difficult to predict nature rhythm, in this case, its intermittence also brings some inconveniences. Ċ To sum up, with the growing of eco-awareness, i would prefer that people should expand the usage of solar system in view of the environmental friendly aspect. However, in order to promote the using of solar system, governments should give more financial support on the basic constructions at the same time."
10253,"we cannot help everyone in the world that needs helps, so we should only be concerned with our own communities and countries. Ċ To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","The writer’s view, there is a hot debate over helping to the everybody that needs it to run the universe. Similarly, the priority in each society should attend their situation. However, I also disagree with the idea that either governments or peoples should help them at any price. For this purpose, there are different ways, like supportive and charity international and regional institution. Ċ Firstly, it is clearly fanciful that we can help all the needy people in the run the cosmos. Furthermore, every country or each one faces a lot of problems. Moreover, in most countries the issue of deficit the budget is an important obstacle to aim for giving opportunities to people for a better life with more amenities. Should the governments or each person helps to other people in the macrocosm, it would be hard to attend their people or their life. Consequently, it could be causing problems such as destitute, jobless and so on. Ċ Secondly, for helping to the people who are needing it, there are different ways that do not necessarily need government or persons. In other words, should they tend to help the other people, they would help to them by own expense. Further, for this case, international and regional institutions and organization were created by a group of countries. For example, the red cross or red crescent has helped the people who hand to mouth in the run the vale. More specifically, the people have suffered from war or natural disasters. Thus, these institutions can attend the deprived people better than others. Ċ In conclusion, as I have noted above, I believe that the useful initiative in supporting the needy people, is using international and regional supportive institution. Next, it would be wrong to use governmental aids for this purpose."
10254,Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle.  To what extend do you agree or disagree.,"It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact. Ċ To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools. Ċ Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others. Ċ Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons."
10255,"As cities expanding, some people claim governments should look forward creating better networks of public transportation available for everyone rather than building more roads for vehicle owning population. What’s your opinion? Give some examples or experience to support.","In this modern era, there is an ongoing deliberation among people on the correlation between public and private transit facilities. While some people believe that government should focus on creating better connectivity for public transportation instead of giving priority to facilitate private roads, the other school of thought does not agree to it. I firmly believe that regime should give an attention to the public commute facilities. Ċ There are tremendous advantages of expanding public related transport facilities such as metro train and bus. Firstly, it will help cities and countries to reduce the traffic jam problems happening during the working hours. Secondly, it is also an environmentSuggestionenvironmentallyenvironmental friendly approach as it will save fuel consumption at drastic level. Moreover, one can save a good amount of money by cutting down the travelling budget in every month by adopting a civil transport. Ċ On the other hand, investing on roads just for a private vehicle owner cannot be much fruitful until those facilities can be consumed by the city transport authorities. In fact, the expansion of such highways and roads will introduce more toll taxes and other expenses to car and truck owners. Furthermore, the municipality requires to take care of such roadways and highways by giving massive expensive contracts to the maintenance companies. A classic example would be an express highway about 100 miles to connect two cities require a huge amount of dollars to maintain the road for many years. Ċ In conclusion, the advantages of increasing connectivity of public transport apparently outweigh the drawbacks. Hence, it is an irrefutable fact that transport authorities should pay attention and avail more and more public level commute options."
10256,Target:Nowadays for many people the internet is replacing regular books. what do you think will happen in the future and what is your opinion.,"The last two decades have seen enormous changes in the way people's lives are affected by the internet. As an extension ,today, many people are using this new technology for reading books instead of printed one.In my opinion ,although tomorrow E-book may get more popularity, regular books will keep their place in this society through some traditional readers. Ċ In fact, the internet and its developments have been providing more convenience for the readers. For instance, today, different websites are available with different informations from the historic time to the very latest events. In addition, now internet is available with many types of tools like mobile phones, tablets,etc which are all easy to carry, so people can read from anywere at anytime. These evidence proves that E - reading will be more familiar in the society. Ċ Although, many factors are there to increase the ussage of internet reading, I believe that printed books will sustain in this world. Because, there are many people still feel physical books are more suitable for reading ,especially for long time.To illustrate, continious watching on computer screen will result irritation for the eyes whereas reading regular books for long time mostly not disturb the readers sight. Such veiws are giving more support to my thinking that ussual books will stay alive in this technological world. Ċ To conclude,In this modern world , a large number of people are using internet as their reading mode.But I strongly belive that there is some reasons to keep regular books active in this society."
10257,Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Others believe that students should spend their whole day on academic studies. Discuss both the views and state your opinion?,"In modern society usage of traditions for earning money has become controversial. Many people opine that this issue will ruin the culture when it is used as a revenue-generating source while others believe that this is the only approach to save the existing traditional heritage. This essay will delve into both these arguments before reaching an opinion. Ċ On the one side, there are clear arguments against exploiting culture for tourist attractions. To begin with, many businesses modify the actual customs in order to attract tourists. Kathakali, a traditional art form of Kerala, for instance, is a one-day program. But, in order to grab the attention of visitors, a shorter version of it that lasts around 15 minutes or 30 minutes is exhibited in front of foreigners. Hence, the original version of it is losing its prominence and subside. As a result, the audience will not understand the exact culture, and that's how the culture gets ruined by money. Ċ On the other side, tourism is the only way to save our customs. This is because many a local exhibit their crafts and traditional art forms in front of the travellers for their livelihood. For example, families run small shops by making handicrafts to sell and Foreigners will be always attracted to such cultural-related things of the various tourist destination they visit. Thus, it will motivate the local craftsman to make more and more traditional items and It helps them to grow economically as well. Due to this, the destruction of the culture of the host nations could be prevented to a great extent. Ċ To summarize, traditions are definitely moulded to grab the eyes of tourists and it is true that the pure form is lost in the process. Nevertheless, I believe that it is always a welcome idea to change it according to the taste of contemporary society so that the cultural heritage could be preserved."
10258,[IELTS TASK]English has become a universal language.Do you think that the positive effects of this trend overweigh negative effects?,"At present time, the role of English as a global language is indispensable. It is worth noting that the prevalence of English worldwide might has its negative effect. In my opinion, English's dominance can be viewed in positive light. Ċ The extensive use of English has contributed to the development of international cooperation, as it removes the language barrier for people from different countries. It should be noted that English as a global language offers us an opportunity to learn advanced knowledge and technology from developed countries. As a tool of cross-cultural communication, English enables companies across border to cooperate with each other and promote economic growth. In addition, people nowadays are likely to exposure to foreign cultures with the help of English. It is no exaggeration that people who cannot speak English find it difficult to survive in this modern society. Ċ Despite the most benefits of the English language, it exerts a negative effect on human civilization. For example, people who immigrate to English-speaking countries are less likely to speak their native language. It is fair to say that English's dominance may lead to the extinction of minority language, thereby creating damage to cultural diversity. It is worth emphasizing that English is able to bridge the language gap and introduce minority cultures to the world, thus protecting these cultures. Ċ In view of these facts, we can come to the conclusion that English plays a vital role in communication and cooperation among countries; therefore, the prevalence of English should be encouraged."
10259,"The internet is viewed as an excellent means of communication by many. However, there are others who would argue that it is actually destroying our communication skills. Discuss both views and give your opinion","It is commonly argued nowadays whether the internet is an outstanding way to communicate or if it is ultimately damaging our social interaction skills. In this essay,I will look into both sides f the debate and will explain why I lean towards the first opinion. Ċ On the one hand, there are people supporting the idea that it has become an essential tool for communication. Firstly, one of the most substantial examples is that it definitely has made the long-distance short. Having said that, it is hard to argue that nowadays we can video chat with our friend and family even if they are in the other part of the world. Another good example, proving the point is uniting a tremendous number of individuals with the same views, hobbies, interests. There are plenty of social platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter. Ċ On the other hand, it is fair to admit that the constant use of the internet may lead to some substantial drawbacks. Community is convinced that it significantly reduces the real-life interaction and physical activity, especially amongst the youth. Numerous studies have proven that overusing this method of communication has caused a social movement in Japan, promoting a total self-isolation from society thus causing a paramount drop in activity and leading to insecurity and depression among teenagers. Another good illustration of the damage to social communication is that this technology is highly addictive. There is no secret that an image of a family dinner with everyone around the table texting to each other is becoming normal these days, thus killing the ability to spend quality time with the closest people in the world. Ċ In conclusion, it is fair to state that both views of the debate have some strong grounds. The internet may be harmful to our social skills when overused, however, I personally think that the benefits it provides for uniting families over video calls and people with the same views significantly outweigh the drawbacks."
10260,It is widely believed that people's ability to learn new things decreases with age and that company should actively recruit younger employees who have greater potential to learn. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this opinion ? YOUNGER AGED EMPLOYEE,"The issue of whether companies should recruit employees aged relatively younger instead of older member of staffs has been widely discussed over the past few years. Notwithstanding the arguments ventilated by proponents that senior workers generally have a greater sense of responsibility in comparison to junior workers, I personally hold the belief that youthful employees should in fact be actively recruited. Two of the principal reason for this are as follows. Ċ To begin with, the advances in science and technology have diametrically revolutionized our working environment since the occurrence of industrialization, and it is important to recognize that increasingly large numbers of work-related inventions and great amount of knowledge have been introduced. Thus, possessing the capability of absorbing new ideas or savvy and readjusting for a new condition is no doubt an intrinsic element for our present workforce. For all practical purposes, younger employees appear to fulfill both of the criterias I mentioned while the older ones fail to satisfy those requirements according to a social experiment conducted by experts from related fields. Ċ Further and even more importantly, no one can deny that the older human beings grow, the worse their abilities of recollection and physical condition become. In other words, intelligence and health are in inverse relation to mankind's age. While advocates of senior employees might not share the sentiment by pointing out the fact that the elders have exclusive attributes that perform an important function in a workplace and therefore can make more contributions to the workforce, there is mounting evidence indicating younger employees can simply acquire the identical qualities as well as abilities in a short amount of time. Ċ By way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that recruiting younger employees has a great impact on companies because of the scientific proofscorroborated be relevant researched and the trend of our society."
10261,There are more and more negative news and Someone think that they would be harmful for the individual and society.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"News is the main resource of information about, what is happening in the world, whether it is bad or good so the news should be true and clear to the public so they can understand it properly. Some argue that so much negative news puts an adverse effect on society or individuals, in my opinion, I partially agree with the aforementioned notion, though, the negative news spreads negativity in the society but it gives us a current report of the incident too. The essay will discuss both facets of a proposal reaching a logical conclusion. Ċ To begin with, the news is the mean of current knowledge about an incident, even it is positive or negative and it depends on an individual that they will learn from them or want to be a victim of the other negative news. The news reflects a present situation about the world as well and makes aware of individuals from an atrocious incident that could happen to them in the future. Additionally, the news also provides awareness to the public. For example, many newsprints or broadcast daily about the current thefts in a particular city, people who live in that area start taking care of themselves and they become aware of the future. Ċ On the other hand, the bad news puts harmful effects on the nation in many ways, firstly, after hearing or reading the bad material about the victim area people start avoiding to deal with that place, to do so they could lose an opportunity. Furthermore, that's why some persons acquired it as a bad sign for them. Secondly, people from other countries, start thinking negatively about the victim country after hearing the negative news. For instance, in Delhi, people stop sending their girls to the city for any purposes, after getting the news about a horrific rape case that happened with a college girl and from that time people from the other countries presume a bad picture about India that, it is not safe for women. Ċ In conclusion, it depends on the person's thinking that how he/she is going to use the knowledge provided by the news, it could be productive if someone takes it for an awareness purpose but it could be a bad sign for some persons."
10262,"In many societies, elderly people often live in retirement homes. This is not appropriate because families should always care for their aging members. Do you agree?","Over the recent years, our attitudes toward elderly people have considerably changed. No one can deny the fact that a majority of old-age people are now residing in nursing homes. In my opinion, senior people should not be abandoned by their families at their old age. They will be in desperate need of emotional support more than any other period in life when they are old. Ċ To begin with, it is the loneliness that elders suffer more than any other physical ailment during their old age; hence, it is essential that families should take care of the elders. In fact, having elderly people at home brings a lot of beneficial effects to the children. Children would be delighted to listen to historical events and stories from their grandparents. In addition, elders are the source of experience and they would be able to guide us when we stumble upon any issues. In fact, grannytheraphy often plays crucial role and still competes with highly sophisticated medical technologies. Ċ India, the country where we live in, is bound by moral values and social responsibilities. Looking after elderly people has been part of our cultural system; therefore, it cannot be ignored. Furthermore, nursing homes may offer professional service to old age people but it cannot provide an environment of love and an unpaid care. Some people may contend that retirement villages are capable to aid elder people in the fast-moving world, but I believe it cannot give the hope and necessity to live. Ċ In conclusion, we should not ignore the elders when they get aged. It is not only our moral responsibility but we are implying our children to take care of us when we get old. Ċ I have rewritten the essay after reading others and would like to have your opinion."
10263,The prevention of health problems and illness is more important than treatment and medicine. Government funding should reflect this. To what extent do you agree?,"Government should fund some projects about preventing health problems because it is more crucial than treating by drugs. In my opinion, I totally agree that the fund of government should be allocated to the prevention of illness. Nevertheless, both sides along with my perspectives linked to the topic will be outlined in the following paragraphs. Ċ There are various arguments in favour of treating patients by using medicine and treatment. The most important one is that they spend less time to cure in the medical process. It is undeniable that most people have unhealthy habits that led to some diseases, including obey, heart attack and countless other types of disease. Consequently, if patients have some severe symptom, they tend to be cured by doctors who used innovative technology about healthcare at hospitals. For example, hardly any people do not like to have dessert, and by consuming too much sugar they have a chance to be diabetes, resulting in curing by doctors. Ċ There are, however, a host of arguments supporting alleviating the root problem of energy. First and foremost, one significant counterargument is the sustainability of an individual's overall well-being. Without a doubt, the government should encourage almost all people to have a high level of fitness by focusing on selecting healthy food or exercising every day. Without sickness or illness, they tend to have a higher performance in their personal and professional lives. Therefore most healthy nations are more likely to give their hands to other unhealthy nations and have happy growth. For instance, those who have a high fitness level can do many activities in their lives. Ċ To sum up, even though there are many reasons supporting treatment and drugs, I am of the opinion that mitigating the root causes of health problems is more important. If families have healthy lives, it is more likely that the countries can move forward."
10264,"As the English language becomes more widespread, some speakers of other languages fear that English loanwords are gradually replacing perfectly adequate native words. To what extent do you believe that people should seek to protect the 'purity' of their language from the influence of English?","There is no doubt that English is becoming increasingly important as a language of international communication in the fields of science, trade, entertainment, and international relations. Not surprisingly, English words have appeared in many other languages throughout the world. Consequently, this has prompted some people to seek to defend their languages from this type of change. In this essay I would like to argue this problem. Ċ It is considered by many that the increasing amount of native words replaced by English words will finally lead to the death of the less influential languages. It is obvious that it is unlikely to happen, although it depends on particular occasions. As an example, the dissolution of a language could be caused by demolition of a country of spoken language as a consequence of a global war. Anyways, what is likely to happen is a merge of languages ensued by blending English and native words. In this case, the vocabulary of native language should be protected. However, there are some difficulties, as the English is still considered as a lingua franca for the most of the fields. Ċ Looking at from a broad historical perspective particular languages become more or less powerful despite any measures taken to protect them. Most humans accept that impact of dominant languages is simply unconstrained. Ċ In my view, all the protection efforts are likely to prove futile. Sooner or later humans it should be conceded that languages change, as all the words of a majority of languages blend or replace each other. Nowadays, English is one of the most spoken languages throughout the world. Obviously, it affects on the other languages in different cases."
10265,Working efficiency - men vs women Some people believe that men and women are equal and so women should be able to do any job they want. Others feel that men and women are not equal and therefore there are certain jobs which are not suitable for women. What is your opinion.,"The gender related categorization of occupations is becoming a thing of the past. While some believe that gender is absolutely irrelevant regarding occupation, others argue that certain work are not appropriate for women. In my opinion, while men and women can perform evenly in majority of tasks, there are certain job functions where men outperform women, owing to the difference in the genders. Ċ The gender of a person is immaterial for undertaking majority of the occupations, despite the fact that they are not equal. In other words, women can perform on par with men in those circumstances. Occupations such teachers, doctors and engineers, for example, are excelled by both men and women. Even though the mental and physical strengths are not equal, within the scope of these job categories, women are capable of delivering similar capacity to men. Ċ On the other hand, there are occupations, physically demanding ones in particular, can be challenging for women to carry out. This is mainly due to the fact that women are biologically not resilient or can not withstand physically demanding processes as much as men do. Occupations in the construction and mining industries, for example, where people have to work tirelessly throughout the day, are not suitable for women as they are not able to withstand the fatigue. Due to these fundamental differences, international labor laws also do not allow women in certain job categories. Ċ To recapitulate, while some argue that gender is immaterial for an occupation, on the basis that men and women are equal, others believe that certain job functions do not suit women due to inequalities in genders. To my mind, though majority of work can be performed equally by both genders, certain occupations are more suitable for men, owing to the biological differences between genders."
10266,It is argued that mobile phones and other electronic devices have no place in the classroom. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?,"Nowadays, mobile phones have become very popular and easily available throughout the world. This has become a part of our everyday life.Most of the students from across the globe have access to smartphones and they have been using these electronic devices not only for educational purposes but also for personal uses. However, I believe, that mobile phones should not be allowed in classrooms, especially in primary level because it distracts the student's mind and also affect the effective interaction. Ċ One of the main reasons for not allowing mobile phones during classes is that, it distracts the students' concentration and also creates chaos in class. This causes disruption and they are found cheating on tests, taking inappropriate photographs and playing mobile games. Rather than paying attention to teachers, they are spending more time on mobile phones.As a result, they don’t understand what the topic is about, obtains poor grades in exams.For instance, during my final year of undergraduate studies, there was a good student in my batch, who failed in his favourite subject because of mobile chatting during the lecture times.So to prevent distractions caused by mobile phones, these kinds of electronic devices should be kept out of the classroom and also some rules should be followed. Ċ Another reason is a disturbance in lecture, discussion between teacher and students. Although they can browse various sites using mobile data or Wi-Fi to get the information discussed in the classroom, but they might miss the main important points and valuable advice, discussed by their teacher. In addition, they might waste too much time visiting the non-authentic sites. For instance, there are also many personal blogs and websites where the student cannot get a relevant understanding of the topic. Ċ To sum up, despite having a few pros of using the mobile devices in classrooms, they must not be allowed to use their cell phones so that in the future this can help them in achieving better results and build bright career.Furthermore, this also maintains a better learning and teaching environment for both the students and teachers."
10267,Some reports have discovered the crimes committed by young women is increasing. Give possible reasons and recommendations to the situation.,"In recent years, there has been a growing tendency that female juvenile delinquency is becoming a common social phenomenon in many countries. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the forces behind this trend and provide the feasible solutions to alleviate its rise. 42 Ċ To begin with, the first reason is that the younger women are usually sensitive to the trifles and sentimental to the loves. In this case, the sensitivity could lead to the formation of extreme ideas and the willingness of conducting the wrongdoings. Besides, the female minors' natural frangibility makes them intend to commit themselves to a series of aggressive behaviour when they have established well founded fears. Second possible force is that the gender inequity in the competitive labour market where women are often confronted with a number of severe competitions. As a result, an illegal conduct may seem as an approach which enables them to make their livings. 109 Ċ However, there are several workable solutions to tackle this regretful situation. From government perspective, relevant authorities should provide low-cost and no fee programs for young female individuals. Counselling service, for example, should be available for those who suffer emotional destructions. This facility helps them to dispel negative feelings and have a positive attitude towards future life. Occupational training as another example, helps young women to enhances their employability in today's labour market. Moreover, from personal level, the female juniors are supposed to accelerate their adaptability to the actual social atmosphere. It is suggested that they should be proactively involved in diversified social activities and interaction with others to gain a clear view of reality. 114 Ċ In conclusion, it is convincing that both the government and women themselves ought to cooperate to curb the ever-increasing the female juvenile delinquency in a long run. 23 / 292"
10268,"school should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program. Ċ Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Ċ Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity Ċ In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound."
10269,In many countries corporal punishments is routinely given to the students while in some countries they are banned. What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving punishments to students?,"Different cultures look punishment at different levels. Corporal punishment in schools varies according to their culture. Western schools are against corporal punishments whereas most of the oriental schools are in favour of corporal punishments in order to mould the younger generation. Ċ Asian schools have a gurukul type of teaching which got influenced by their tradition. Asian culture of moulding a student's character and career requires canes to punish them if they are in a wrong way. Either curricular or co-curricular teachers have the responsibility to moulds a student's career as well as character. If children are not punished they will have a tendency to do the same mistake again and again on the other hand, advices or philosophy does not make any different in a child's mind. Famous experimentalist Mr. Pavlov once proved that animals shows a positive response when get punished. A student is unaware about the value of literacy and character formation. Ċ In contrast, western countries such as America, Australia and Newzealand banned corporal punishment in schools. Europeans have no respect towards their hierarchy. Teachers and elders are considered as mere civilians. Respect for hierarchy plays a major role in moulding discipline. Lack of discipline and character formation can leads to anarchy. When there is no discipline in schools children will have their legs upon the desk and will hang around in the class while taking classes. Ċ However punishment should have a limit. Punishment should be mild so that next time the student won't repeat the same mistake again and again. Instead punishment should not be harsh in order to show teachers hatred and vengeance towards the student which will have an adverse effect in student's career. Ċ To conclude corporal punishments should be given to students with a motive correct them. Discipline, career, moreover character should be moulded in childhood itself for a better tomorrow."
10270,"These days, an increasing number of people in many cities know little about their neighbors and do not have a sense of community. What do you think are the causes and what solutions can you suggest?","Currently, humankind is closing its inner circle of friends and hardly interacting with new people. This is making individuals not enjoy the fullest of their cities and not knowing other citizens. I believe the causes for it are the advance in entertainment technologies and our modern lives, however, the government can do several actions to tackle this issue and maximize social events. Ċ First of all, electronic devices changed the way people entertain themselves. There are several kinds of entertainment without needing to leave our houses nowadays. For example, people can use computers or subscribe to one of the plenty streaming services available and never be bored anymore. That is why local authorities must create interesting events to make people socialize more. A few solutions to this issue could be community fairs with crafts from local individuals, moreover, regular sports competitions with an after-party for only local residents so they can know more about their neighbours. Ċ Likewise, the fast-paced work-life everyone has and the lack of free time also make it difficult to start new friendships. Individuals tend to spend more time at work than at home and are constantly tired to go to social events. Therefore, the government should create laws that would allow workers to have one day off every month if they do something for the community. For instance, voluntary work within the neighbourhood they live in, such as, help elders in need, some maintenance at the local park, anything that would be done amongst their neighbours. Ċ In conclusion, our modern lives took us apart from our communities. Thus, local authorities must do something to change this. Some solutions are voluntary work and more social events so citizens could interact and meet new friends."
10271,"Artists like writers , actors and singers grab more attention than scientists and inventors. Do you agree or disagree with this view?","People who are into acting, dancing, singing, and other similar professions are often having godlike status compared to other professions like engineers and scientists. I completely agree with this and will be discussing the same with some examples. Ċ Firstly, artists are very close to the public through social media. Their professions invoke them to stay active in many social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Because of this general public feel that they know them well enough. Additionally, actors are shown in movies, reality shows, and comedy shows now and then. For instance, actors and singers like Amir khan and Taylor Swift have more Instagram and Twitter followers than others like Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella. This shows that people are more interested in artists than inventors. Ċ On the other hand, scientists, doctors, and others try to stay away from social media to increase productivity. Their job demands them to focus more on innovative ideas. To elaborate this, from the ,past there are pieces of evidence that few scientists had worked in labs for years without contacting the outside world. They come into the limelight only when their idea is a huge success. For example, the founder of OYO company doesn't seem to have much following on social media, most of the people doesn't know his name either. Ċ To conclude, although, inventors contribute a lot to society, they tend to grab less attention because of multiple factors. And artists connect to the common people because of the entertainment they provide and also because of their role in our daily lives."
10272,"More and more couples are deciding to be ""child-free"", to have no children, in other words. Some people claim that those couples reach this conclusion through entirely selfish reasons. While others think that they came to this decision through noble motives, such as concern about overpopulation and desire for independence. Ċ Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is often said that most couples all around the world are deciding to stop having children. Many opine that this is about their personal lifestyle. However ,some communities claim their decision is related to noble incidences such as concern about overpopulation and desire for independence. From my point of view ,I strongly believe they want to conduct a global movement rather than considering their own lives. Ċ Firstly ,in my opinion ,this decision could have universal goals. For example ,most people who live in the world believe that the population is increasing dramatically. This is a common belief that breeding by human beings should be stopped because of multiple reasons such as the lack of resources as well as food production. It is estimated that about 10 billion people will live on the Earth by 2050. These people habitually believe to perform it they have an opportunity to prevent these dire events in the future. Therefore ,this makes it clear why it is due to noble motives. Ċ By contrast ,some individuals opine that this pertains to human lifestyles and some selfish reasons. For instance ,nowadays in today's modern world individuals who do not have any child , have many suitable opportunities to spend a lot of time performing their favourite activities. Additionally ,a significant benefit for mothers is having a strong body to take up exercise. It means they are not required to carry a baby by themselves for about 9 months. It can be a persuasive reason to accept that view. As a result ,it becomes apparent there are multiple reasons behind each claim via societies. Ċ All things considered ,I personally believe it is a decision related to our global relevant not ,just for individual's profit. It is predicted that to continue ceasing to have a child we will be faced a better globe in the near future."
10273,Some people think that having people from different nationalities and cultural backgrounds living together in the same country develop faster. Do you agree or disagree?,"There is a view that having people from other cultures contributes to the faster development of the country they live in. This essay will discuss why do I personally agree with the provided statement and relevant arguments to support my position will be provided. Ċ Firstly, let's review what has been already achieved by the cooperation of people from different nationalities. Many leading states are currently opening their borders in order to unite the best persons from abroad and improve the economy by taking into account all possible circumstances by using the opinions of people abroad. For instance, although the German society of higher schoolers is not as diverse as in the US, it has been showing great success in improving common well-being for more than ten years, namely, decreasing trends of unemployment among all residents. Cultural exchange definitely provides us with the best solutions to existing problems. Ċ Secondly, we need to look at how the European Union policy gives an opportunity to get a prospective education, therefore, contributing to the common state development. This fact allows students from abroad to study in the best places and they will be prepared for serious tasks. For example, according to recent observations, countries with a bigger amount of international students are more likely to overcome economical crises in the future. Preparing diverse teams of specialists sure improves a certain society. Ċ To conclude, I would like to say that I strongly agree with the given statement since recent data and statistics show overall positive trends in multicultural states."
10274,"many university students live with their families,while other live away from home because their university are in different places. what are the advantages and disadvantages of both situations.","There is no doubt that universities provide great accommodation facilities. While some students prefer living with their parents, others choose college housing. This essay will discuss both, the positive and negative side of this argument. Ċ Firstly, the main advantage of staying with your family is the sharing of household chores. This results in having more time that can be spent on studies. For instance, all members can divide their duties such as grocery shopping, cleaning and dishes. Furthermore, this can also have a bad effect on student's privacy. For example, with families, social gatherings are very common, there are festivals and holidays which are often celebrated. The crucial time, that could have been spent on learning is wasted on these events. Ċ Secondly, when living in a college apartment, you are independent and become more responsible. To illustrate, a person staying alone generally has to plan all things in advance like the monthly budget or the meal preparation. As a result, a person learns valuable life lessons, namely finances and time management. In Addition, there are some drawbacks to this. In other words, people usually suffer from emotional issues. This is because, all the new things college brings are usually overwhelming. Which can result in lack of concentration in studies and finally depression. Ċ To conclude, although universities bring a lot of new challenges and learning, we cannot overlook its difficulties. Living on campus can help individuals by teaching them new responsibilities, still it lacks in emotional support which one's parents can provide."
10275,"With deforestation, urban development and illegal hunting, many animal species are becoming endangered as they lose their habitat and some are even threatened to the point of extinction. the importance of animals protection","The number of animal species in danger is rising rapidly as their habitats are destroyed and some are even driven to the point of extinction. This is the result of deforestation, urban development and illegal hunting. Personally, I agree that it is vital to protect animals and measures must be taken to tackle this problem. Ċ There are reasons why protecting animals is crucial. Firstly, we live in a world where together all species make up this delicately balanced ecosystem and the disappear of any animal species might cause a chain reaction on the entire system, including humans. For example, many of our crop plants rely on pollinating birds and mammals to produce seeds. And the decline in these animals would result in decrease in our food supply. Secondly, a great diversity of animal species can act as a source of art and entertainment, enriching human lives. For example, the peacock with its colorful tail, a great inspiration to humans, has been reflected in art and literature of many cultures. Ċ Solutions must be applied to solve this problem. One step is government must eliminate corruption and ensure fair enforcement of forest and wildlife conservation policies. By strictly enforcing these preservation laws, rules and regulations, deforestation and illegal hunting can be limited. Another step is the promotion of building sustainable and environmentally friendly cities that embrace safe habitats and environmental conditions for animal species. For example, such economy based on sustainable environment such as investment in green infrastructure, green public transportation, and renewable energy should be encouraged. Further more, individuals must be educated to be aware of their responsibility for protecting threatened animal species. People can choose to buy recycled paper and sustainable products like bamboo, which can contribute to protect forest animal species. Ċ In conclusion, I totally agree that it is crucial to protect animals and solutions must be implemented to tackle this issue."
10276,"experts believe that, over the next decade, robot will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans. discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.","Technology has revolutionalised the world in the last few years. In the near future, pundits reckon that machine will be taking over the work at present performed by humankind. I propound that using automation has numerous merits such as cost-saving and reduced accidents and the demerits like unemployment and increase dependency. This essay will discuss the reasons why I am holding this view. Ċ The main advantage of using robots in performing jobs is reduced product cost with increased efficiency. By the automation enhanced precision in the final product can be obtained because of the reduction in error product will be more economical. Thus, a lot of time will be saved. For example, Amazon is using the fully automated line for their supply and logistic system which has minimised error and save hours of manpower. Therefore, with modernisation maximum utilization of resources can be achieved. Moreover, Space programmes and Military can use machines for their missions and can avoid human loss under extreme fatal conditions. Ċ One possible drawback of using robots is the higher job losses. As the work will be taking over by the bots it may result in unemployment because employees were replaced by the droids. For instance, Tesla's new factory has a manufacturing process that is totally controlled by bots. Hence, excessive usage of droids could cause problems for humans. Furthermore, the usage of robots may make the human race lethargic and over-dependent on them. Ċ In conclusion, there is numerous positive impact of robotic advancement in our life but also has many downsides too. It has helped humans to solve complex problems under tough conditions. I opine that people cannot abandon technology now but we can ensure not to let it control us."
10277,"some people say material possessions are very useful in bringing us happpiness, but others argue that they are useless in terms of providing happiness. discuss both views and give your opinion and reasons","According to a number of folks, materialistic items are the best option in order to make us happy, while others disagree with this viewpoint as they consider such kinds of things just wastage. I my opinion, I also disagree with the above statement. I will discuss both viewpoints along with my perspective in the upcoming paragraphs. Ċ On one side, sometimes it's a desire of an individual to purchase something specific for a long time and finally when he has that he is feeling in the sky.For example, a person is doing really hard work to buy something special for his loving one so that he can bring a smile to her face and by doing so he will automatically be happy to see the smile on his girlfriend. Hence, gifts are used to make themselves and others happy. Ċ On the other hand, it makes the people very selfish and the actual value of relations are spoiling.To explicate, some bonds are breaking because of these artificial things. A survey held, a few years ago in Italy showed the main reason behind the divorce is this extra dependency on material things as if the partner is not able to provide that thing, eventually destroy the relationship because this makes the relation very fake and will not give actual happiness. Ċ In conclusion, although giving and receiving gifts brings a duplicate smile on one's s face but it's actually making the relations very fake, even though sometimes people lost a very valuable person because that person is not able to fulfil their materialistic desires."
10278,Most school offer some type of physical education program to their students. Why it is important? Should physical education classes be required or optional?,"Physical education programs are offered widely in school systems. Although, there have been a number of given opinion supposed that physical education should be optional. Exercises are undeniably essential, especially at growing ages, thanks to its benefits for both mental and physical health of a student. Ċ A great deal of conducted researches has indicated the major variety of benefits of exercises for one's physical health. Scientists claimed that a regularly active lifestyle would protect us from certain diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, and the largest concern of western countries: obesity. Additional, physical activities can act as an aid to prevent student from excessive time spent on their electronic devices. Ċ Moreover, exercises are proved to help releasing endorphin, which is a hormone that improves one's mood by reducing stress and anxiety. Therefore, physical education will stimulate a happy and healthy lifestyle of a student. In addition, research showed that student who involved in physical activities consistently tend to sleep well at night and, as a result, perform better in school. Ċ Unfortunately, there are several inevitable circumstances in which a student has a difficult physical condition, e.g. handicapped or asthmatic, that prevent them from engaging such physical activities. In that case, school should give them some sort of special permission like allowing them to absent in physical education periods. This solution might be a better option comparing to make the subject optional, which would encourage lazy students not to participate. Ċ In conclusion, physical education should not be optional since it is physically and mentally beneficial for a student. Nevertheless, in some unavoidable special cases, students can be permitted to abstain from exhausting activities."
